These scripts are for setting up the Azure/azureml-examples repository, including Azure resouces, using the Azure CLI and GitHub CLI.

To setup the repository, simply run the `azure-github.sh` script:

```bash
bash azure-github.sh
```

This will run the other scripts for creating compute and datasets. Adjust as needed.
