### Basic setup

**Connect to workspace.**

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

For more details: [Workspaces](workspace)

**Connect to compute target.**

```python
from azureml.core import ComputeTarget
target = ComputeTarget(ws, '<compute-target-name>')
```

For more details: [Compute Target](compute-targets)

**Prepare Python environment.**  
You can use a `requirements.txt` file to define a Python environment on your compute.

```python
from azureml.core import Environment
env = Environment.from_pip_requirements('<environment-name>', '<path/to/requirements.txt>')
```

You can also use conda environments and docker images to prepare your environments.  

For more details: [Environment](environment)


### Submit code

To run code in AML you need to:

1. **Configure**: Configuration includes specifying the code to run, the compute
target to run on and the Python environment to run in.
2. **Submit**: Create or reuse an AML Experiment and submit the run.

#### ScriptRunConfig (Configure)

A typical directory may have the following structure:

```bash
source_directory/
    script.py    # entry point to your code
    module1.py   # modules called by script.py     
    ...
```

To run `$ (env) python <path/to/code>/script.py [arguments]` on a remote compute cluster `target: ComputeTarget` with an
environment `env: Environment` we use the `ScriptRunConfig` class.

```python
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

config = ScriptRunConfig(
    source_directory='<path/to/code>',  # relative paths okay
    script='script.py',
    compute_target=target,
    environment=env,
    arguments=arguments,
)
```

For more details on specifying arguments: [Command line arguments](script-run-config#command-line-arguments)

:::info
- `compute_target`: If not provided the script will run on your local machine **TODO: does this require docker?**
- `environment`: If not provided, uses a default Python environment managed by Azure ML (azureml.core.runconfig.DEFAULT_CPU_IMAGE) **TODO: provide details on this image**.
:::

#### Experiment (Submit)

To submit this code, create an `Experiment`: a light-weight container that helps to
oraganize our submissions and keep track of code (See [Run History](run-history)).

```python
exp = Experiment(ws, '<experiment-name>')
run = exp.submit(config)
print(run.get_portal_url())
```

This link will take you to the Azure ML Studio where you can monitor your run.

For more details: [ScriptRunConfig](script-run-config)

### Connect to data

To work with data in your training scripts using your workspace `ws` and its default datastore:

```python
datastore = ws.get_default_datastore()
dataset = Dataset.File.from_files(path=(datastore, '<path/on/datastore>'))
```
For more details see: [Data](data)

Pass this to your training script as a command line argument.

```python
arguments=['--data', dataset.as_mount()]
```
