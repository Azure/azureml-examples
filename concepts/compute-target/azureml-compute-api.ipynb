    "Azure Machine Learning Compute is managed compute infrastructure that allows the user to easily create single to multi-node compute of the appropriate VM Family. It is created **within your workspace region** and is a resource that can be used by other users in your workspace. It autoscales by default to the max_nodes, when a job is submitted, and executes in a containerized environment packaging the dependencies as specified by the user. \n",
