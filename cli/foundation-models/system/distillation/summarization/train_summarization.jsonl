Kathleen Adair, 39, was walking her three dogs up Davies Creek Trail in Alaska on Christmas Eve when she spotted the bird with each leg shut inside traps. She spent an hour freeing the creature before alerting a bird rescue firm. Heading home, she also sprung another trap which she spotted in the ground - prompting an investigation by Alaska Wildlife Troopers that landed her in court. Eventually tracked down by authorities she was charged and hauled to court facing a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. Arrested: Kathleen Adair, 39, was charged with hindering lawful trapping after snaring three traps in Alaska . The eagle was found and euthanized three days after she freed it. 'What we expect from the public is if they come upon an eagle in a trap, to notify us as soon as possible. That way we can go out there and see what's going on,' Alaska Wildlife Trooper Sgt Aaron Frenzel told the station. Defending her actions, Adair\u00a0told the Juneau Empire she is not 'an ecoterrorist trying to ruin trappers' livelihood.' 'I grew up hunting and fishing here, I've got several animal skins on my walls,' she said. 'I don't personally trap, and I don't choose to, I don't want to, but I'm not going to stop someone else from doing it. I only object when the traps are on the trail where I think they are safety concerns.' Speaking to KTOO, she said: 'I knew at the time that the eagle didn't have a very good chance. I knew if I left it there all night, it would have had a worse chance of surviving. 'But even as it was, I could tell one of the legs was just dangling, just completely broken and I knew they wouldn't be able to fix that, but I was hoping they could at least fix the other and keep it as an educational bird.' 'I wanted to go back and tell the Raptor Center where it was. I knew that would be the best thing to do, but I also knew that it would be getting dark soon. Saved: The Bald Eagle caught in a leg-hold trap in Juneau on Christmas Eve, found and released by Adair . 'It was two miles from the road and it was all the way at the end of the road, so I knew that they wouldn't be able to get out there that day to it. 'I'm not against trapping per se. I am concerned about the traps when they're on the trail in such a way as these were,' Adair said. On Thursday, the case was dismissed by a judge who called Adair's work 'admirable'. 'Her actions in saving the eagle were laudable,' Juneau District Attorney James Scott said during Adair's arraignment on Thursday afternoon. 'She should not have to run the risk of a conviction on her record for this offense.' 'When she's hiking and she comes across an eagle in a snare, I encourage her to rescue that eagle again, and I will screen that case out as well,' the district attorney added, according to the Empire."}]}

The high street retail giant is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops. The supermarket giant is keen to use new technologies to offer a wider range of products to consumers. Company researchers believe 3D printers are a natural progression given that they already offer photo and poster printing . The project could also see Tesco stores repair broken items or print spare parts for a product that has already been purchased. Paul Wilkinson, a lead research specialist with Tesco, revealed the retail giant\u2019s ambitions writing a blog post on tesco.com about the potential of 3D printing. He said: '3D printing] could revolutionise the way we view stores and what we can get from them.' Wilkinson, who is heading on a fact-finding mission to San Francisco with a team from Tesco, added in The Grocer magazine: 'We already print photos and posters in many of our larger stores, so why not other gifts and personalised items? 'How about letting kids design their own toys and then actually being able to get them made? What if we had a digital catalogue of spare parts for items that you\u2019d bought? 3D printing is burgeoning industry with all manner of objects, such as this gun, now being created. 'They could be printed on demand and ready for you by the time you\u2019d finished your shopping. You could even take a broken item into store; we could scan it in 3D, repair it digitally and make you a new one. 'There\u2019s been a lot of buzz recently. It\u2019s great that we have one of the machines to test out and to be able to look at how they might change the way stores work.' He said the Tesco team would be meeting \u201csome of the big names and getting together with lots of start-ups and trying to find that idea or product that might just change the retail world.' This is not the first time 3D technology has attracted headlines after it was revealed recently a printed gun had been digitally made.  The blueprints for the gun were then posted on a website and downloaded over 100,000 times. The Mail on Sunday also printed their own gun and demonstrated how easy it was to get it through immigration and security."}]}

But they are now very close to not being able to do so. They are fighting with normal weapons, whereas the ISIS has got tanks and mortars,\" Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said in a statement. \"The international community needs to defend them. The international community cannot sustain another city falling under ISIS.\" Were Kobani to fall, ISIS would control a complete swath of land between its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, and Turkey -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers (62 miles). Outnumbered and outgunned by ISIS, local fighters trying to defend the Kurdish-dominated city have tried to flee into Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Kobani was about to fall to ISIS as protests raged in his country over how the group should be handled. And hours after U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS struck near Kobani overnight, the city's future was far from certain. Stopping ISIS from taking over cities, towns and other territory in Syria isn't the focus of U.S. efforts, a senior administration official and a U.S. official told CNN. At a briefing, a State Department spokeswoman faced persistent questions over whether saving the city was a U.S. priority. The answer, CNN global affairs correspondent Elise Labott said, sounded like a resounding \"no.\" \"It's obviously horrific to watch what's going on the ground, but it's important for the United States, for us to also step back and remember our strategic objective as it relates to our efforts and our engagement in Syria,\" spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. The U.S. goal, she said, is \"a deliberate, well thought-out campaign in Syria\" to disrupt ISIS command and control, destroy the group's infrastructure and attack sources of fuel and financing for ISIS. \"Certainly no one wants to see Kobani fall, but our primary objective here is preventing (ISIS) from gaining a safe haven,\" she said. \"And we're going after those specific structures that I mentioned,\" Psaki added. \"But we would not have taken the range of military strikes we have taken, including overnight, if we did not want to support and -- and defend the area.\" Five airstrikes targeting groups of ISIS fighters struck near Kobani overnight, U.S. Central Command said.  There were another four strikes elsewhere in Syria and four in Iraq. \"Finally, they are hitting the right places,\" one local fighter against ISIS said after the airstrikes near Kobani, which is close to  the Turkish border and key to ISIS' effort to extend its terrain. Airstrikes against the radical Islamist group in Kobani can be challenging because many targets are too close to the Turkish border or Kurdish forces to strike, a senior U.S. military official said. Violent protests in Turkey . Destroying ISIS will require ground operations, Erdogan said, according to the semi-official Anadolu news agency. Speaking to Syrian refugees, he said there has been \"no achievement yet,\" despite months of efforts against ISIS. Erdogan called for a no-fly zone, and for the arming of opposition groups in Iraq and Syria. People upset over what they consider Turkey's failure to respond adequately to the ISIS threat launched protests in Turkey, some of which turned violent. Three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout Turkey, police said, according to Anadolu. At least five Turkish police officers were among the injured, Anadolu said. There were clashes overnight in Istanbul, and a group of about 50 to 60 protesters blocked a road, CNN affiliate CNN Turk reported. Some demonstrators set fire to a bus and garbage truck and smashed windows and cars. One protester was killed in the middle of a demonstration after being hit in the head by a gas canister in the town of Varto, police said. And two protesters died during demonstrations in the southeastern province of Siirt, Anadolu reported. In Belgium, meanwhile, Kurdish protesters stormed the European Parliament building.  CNN affiliate RTL Belgium said about 50 protesters stormed into the building.  Police then cordoned it off. Some European nations have joined the fight against ISIS, but the Kurdish protesters want tougher action. Belgium participated in overnight airstrikes in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said. Dutch join in, Canada to follow suit . Dutch forces participated for the first time in airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq as well, dropping three bombs on ISIS vehicles that were shooting at Kurdish Peshmerga forces, the Dutch Defense Ministry said in a statement. The vehicles were destroyed, and ISIS fighters may have been killed, the ministry said. Canada's Parliament approved an air combat mission against ISIS in Iraq, pledging up to six CF-18 fighter jets as part of a strike force, in addition to other aircraft for surveillance, reconnaissance and refueling. \"To be absolutely clear, Canada's engagement in Iraq is not a ground combat mission. It includes a number of targeted measures, being taken with allies, to severely limit the ability of ISIL to engage in full scale military movements and to operate bases in the open,\" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. \"We do not take this step lightly. The threat posed by ISIL is real. If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly.\" Near Kobani, airstrikes hit ISIS vehicles . In Syria, according to U.S. Central Command, the airstrikes against ISIS included: . -- One south of Kobani destroyed three ISIS armed vehicles and damaged another . -- One southeast of Kobani destroyed an ISIS armed vehicle carrying anti-aircraft artillery . -- Two southwest of Kobani damaged an ISIS tank . -- One south of Kobani destroyed an ISIS unit . Elsewhere in Syria, two strikes west of al-Hasakah hit multiple ISIS buildings, one near Deir Ezzor struck an ISIS staging area and IED production facility, and one southwest of Rabiyah struck a small group of ISIS fighters. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE all participated in the strikes, Central Command said. Death toll in fight for Kobani . More than 400 people have been killed in the fight for Kobani since mid-September, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said it has documented the deaths of 219 ISIS jihadists, 163 members of the Kurdish militia, and 20 civilians. A northern Iraqi hospital has received the bodies of at least 29 suspected ISIS militants, the head of the Tal Afar hospital said Tuesday. Danial Qassim said most were killed in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes overnight. Tal Afar is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul -- Iraq's second-largest city.  Mosul has also been overtaken by ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. How ISIS makes its millions . Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department. The data, apparently sent out inadvertently to the Pentagon's press contacts on Monday, listed the total number of airstrikes by U.S. Central Command in Iraq and Syria. It also detailed locations of targets and specified the costs of munitions used."}]}

The former Germany great left FIFA's executive committee months after the vote in December 2010 gave Russia the 2018 event and Qatar the 2022 tournament. Beckenbauer remains active in FIFA but was briefly banned in June by the ethics committee from all football-related activity for failing to cooperate with prosecutor Michael Garcia's corruption investigation. The suspension was lifted after Beckenbauer pledged to answer the questions put to him. Franz Beckenbauer (with Xavi Alonso) has added his voice to calls for FIFA to publish the Garcia report . Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as a player and coach with West Germany, refused to disclose who he voted for but maintained he was neither offered nor accepted any financial inducements or gifts. 'Nobody offered me anything in order to influence my vote. No. This did not happen,' Beckenbauer said through a translator in London. 'As far as the vote is concerned I can't say anything because it was a secret ballot and I have to observe this agreement made at the time.' Beckenbauer said he cannot understand why FIFA President Sepp Blatter wants Garcia's report to remain secret, echoing calls for its public release from current executives, including Michel Platini. 'Personally there's nothing to hide,' Beckenbauer, who is a special adviser to FIFA's football committee, said at the Security Sport conference. 'If you have nothing to hide you can publish and divulge it.' Sepp Blatter (right, with actor Gerard Depardieu) has faced increasing pressure to publish the findings . Despite the conference being staged by Qatar's International Centre for Sport Security, Beckenbauer questioned a key aspect of the Gulf nation's bid - the energy-intensive cooling technology to cope with the summer heat. Discussions between FIFA and Qatar organizers about shifting the World Cup dates are continuing, while the hosts maintain they can stage the event at any time in the year. 'I was surprised Qatar won,' Beckenbauer said. 'In the summer it's not possible to play football there despite the fact Qatar developed a system of cooling the stadiums in order to create more comfortable temperatures. 'Technically speaking it's possible, but is it necessary? It wastes a lot of energy ... my suggestion would be to play in the winter.'"}]}

The pilot straightens out the plane as he prepares to douse the flames . The 47-second video shows the plane straightening out as it rapidly approaches the fire scene on a gravel road that is blocked by authorities. With just a few feet to spare the plane drops a massive amount of water on the smouldering wreckage. The lorry and grader are not visible through the wall of water. The Labrador fire service had been dealing with widespread forest fires all summer and decided not to take any chances, so it requested aid from above. There was a lack of available water to put out the fire and because of the isolated rural location the authorities were anxious that a fire truck would not be able to prevent the flames from spreading to the dry grass and trees. The lorry driver was trapped inside the burning vehicle but the driver of the road grader managed to pull him to safety. Timing: The pilot releases the water at just the right time as he flies directly over the fire .

The group was discovered in an underground room with heavy chains linking them together. The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi. All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN. Of the adults, 47 had been released to their families, and seven were handed over to a shelter for the homeless, he said. Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said. Officials said the facility was part madrassa and part drug-rehab facility, and the captives were chained at night apparently to prevent their escape. \"The operation was successful, and we plan on continuing our work to ensure that places like this are shut down,\" Marwat said. Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts. During the day, they worked and did religious studies. But the future of the rescued children was unclear. One woman told a local television station that she was willing to pay the police to keep her troublesome child. She said she would rather have the facility remain open, regardless of how it treated the children. Many others, however, said they were in shock and disbelief over the allegations. One man complained he was deep in debt after paying the school a large amount of money to board his son."}]}

Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Airbus store planes at these bases, with the hope the planes will fly again. However many are eventually scrapped or used for spare parts. Scroll down for video . Commercial aircraft sit on the tarmac at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California. In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the airline industry suffered a drop in revenue which resulted in many older airplanes being taken out of service and grounded . There are 11 major bases across the U.S. that are used to store retired planes, yet these images are taken from largest and most densely populated bases. These are the Pinal Airpark in Marana and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, California's Southern Logistics Airport in Victorville and the Mojave Air & Space Port, and the Roswell International Air Center in Roswell, New Mexico.

The Airpark is mainly used as a 'boneyard' for . commercial planes, and old airplanes are stored there with the hope that the . desert climate will stop them from rusting. Pinal Airpark covers an area of 2,080 acres and has single runway measuring 6,849 by 150 feet. The Southern California Logistics Airport is a public airport located in the city of Victorville in San Bernardino County. The facility was George Air Force Base between 1941 to 1992 and was used as a front-line United States Air Force base . An intact T-33 Shooting Star aircraft sits in the shadows of a dismantled B-47 Stratojet aircraft at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center in Tucson, Arizona. More than 2,500 aircraft from all services are stored at the centre. Most of the aircraft are used for parts, returned to service, sold to foreign governments or donated to federal and state agencies . The Airpark is used as a parachute testing and training facility and in March Navy SEAL SCPO Brett Shadle was killed during parachute training at the facility, and another SEAL was injured. At the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base there are more than $35billion (\u00a322billion) worth of . outdated planes kept as spare parts for current models.

AMARG has approximately $35 billion (\u00a322 billion) worth of aircraft, totalling around 4,500 planes, from all of various commercial and military companies . The planes in AMARG are used to replace more than 350,000 spare parts for active planes including engines, munitions, wiring and . electronics. Some planes are stored at the . base between deployments but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,500 . aircraft kept there are for parts.

But passengers won't be boarding a hybrid plane any time soon, as a jetline would only be able to stay airborne for a matter of minutes.

The aircraft, which is based on a commercially available singe seater, is also able to recharge its batteries in flight. Based on a commercially available single seater, the aircraft is also able to recharge its batteries in flight. During the tests the plane performed a series of 'hops' along the runway, before a flight at over 1,500 feet. The plane, whose hybrid engine was designed and built by engineers at Cambridge with Boeing funding support, works by the same principle as a hybrid car. During take off, when it needs most power, it uses both the petrol engine and the electric motor, but once cruising height is reached the electric motor can be switched onto generator mode. This will then recharge the batteries or it can be switched to motor assist mode to save fuel. 'Although hybrid cars have been available for more than a decade, what's been holding back the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft until now is battery technology,' said Dr Paul Robertson of Cambridge's Department of Engineering, who led the project. 'Until recently, they have been too heavy and didn't have enough energy capacity. But with the advent of improved lithium-polymer batteries, similar to what you'd find in a laptop computer, hybrid aircraft \u2013 albeit at a small scale \u2013 are now starting to become viable.' Dr Robertson said that while this is an is an important step in the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft, more research is required before commercial airliners will be powered entirely with electric motors. Currently if all the engines and all the fuel in a modern aircraft were replaced by batteries, it would have a total flying time of roughly ten minutes."}]}

Quigg was taken the distance by the Japanese visitor in Liverpool on Saturday night, winning almost every round in what was a workmanlike victory. The 26-year-old from Bury will now hope his promoter Eddie Hearn can deliver a career-defining unification clash against Carl Frampton or Leo Santa Cruz when he returns to the ring in March. Scott Quigg successfully defended his WBA world super bantamweight title with a win over Hidenori Ohtake . Quigg celebrates his victory in Liverpool as he retained his world super bantamweight crown . Ohtake was fighting outside of Japan for the first time in his career but his only defeat came on points over five rounds in 2007. He had also never faced anyone with a losing record. But Quigg looked to take control from the first bell as he targeted the body, looking for one of his trademark finishes. In the second round, a right hook upstairs wobbled Ohtake who stumbled backwards but was able to see out the remainder of the three-minute session. Neither man was prepared to give an each as the fight continued on the inside in the third round with Ohtake matching the champion punch for punch. Ohtake had never fought outside his home country before and was something of an unknown for Quigg . Ohtake suffered a nasty cut above his right eye which had to be checked a few times by the doctor . Quigg continued to land his right hook to the head in rounds three and four but they proved to be brief successes rather than sustained attacks. With limited footage of the visiting Ohtake available, Quigg had gone into the fight slightly hampered but there was little doubt that the Japanese challenger was made of strong stuff. It wasn't until the eighth round that Quigg was able to find the room to let his hands go but Ohtake stood up to the onslaught. Ohtake had suffered a cut above his right eye which the referee had the ringside doctor check in the tenth stanza but she cleared him to continue. Quigg (left) admitted his opponent was tough and very durable as he lasted the full distance . The officials went through the same procedure in the penultimate round but Ohtake soldiered on, despite the blood running down his face and withstood a fierce left hook on the bell. Ohtake rallied in the final session, knowing he needed a knockout to win but was unable to land the telling blow. All three judges gave Quigg the nod, by scores of 119-109 twice and 118-110. Quigg said: 'I tell you what, I know his head is tough, I tried to pour on the gas at the end and landed some great combinations but he wasn't going nowhere and fair play to him, but 12 rounds is never a bad thing to get under your belt.'"}]}

On Tuesday the Bank of England's archives -- published digitally for the first time -- reveal that \u00a35.6 million of gold was transferred just days after the Nazi siege of Czechslovakia in 1939, which was one of the catalysts that sparked the war. While the transfers themselves were known at the time, the archives unmask private letters and telephone conversations where the Bank of England avoided questions over its Czech gold holdings from the Treasury. The bank sanctioned the transfer of gold -- worth an estimated \u00a3736.4 million ($1.1 billion) today, according to the Financial Times -- between two accounts held by the National Bank of Czechoslovakia and the German central bank, known then as the Reichsbank. Albrecht Ritschl, professor of economic history at the London School of Economics, told CNN that the Bank of England \"in cold blood, and pretending not to know what these accounts were and where the gold was coming from, agreed to the transfer.\" Ritschl said: \"From the Czech point of view this was very clearly a breach of trust.\" The Bank of England declined to comment when contacted by CNN. The archived document claims bank officials suspected but were \"not sure\" the accounts were Czech and German. However, they believed it was \"no business of theirs,\" as both accounts were held by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) -- a central bankers' bank. But David Blaazer, a historian at the University of New South Wales and author of a study on the Bank of England and Czech gold, told CNN: \"There is absolutely no doubt that the Bank knew which numbered BIS account belonged to which central bank.\" Despite an attempt by the British government to block all Czech assets in the UK, the transfer went ahead and the story caused an outpouring of public anger. Banker for Germany . With the UK heavily exposed to the German debt crisis in 1931, such transfers were part of an \"economic appeasement\" plan of Nazi Germany by Britain, according to Ritschl. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was keen to avoid conflict with Adolf Hitler's Germany after the human cost and economic devastation caused by the First World War. This culminated in Britain, France, Germany and Italy signing the 'Munich Pact,' leading to the annexation of Czechoslovakia and the country's eventual invasion. Ritschl said: \"This policy started in 1933 when Hjalmar Schacht was reinstalled by Hitler as president of the Reichsbank. \"This was beneficial in the short term for Britain, as Nazi Germany unblocked British assets frozen in Germany,\" Ritschl told CNN. \"Britain then resumed its traditional role as a banker and insurer for Germany's foreign trade. As the episode shows, the Nazis had a reliable partner,\" he said. After the gold transfer, the assets were \"disposed\" of with around \u00a34 million going to the central banks of Belgium and Holland and the remainder sold in London, according to the official report. Ritschl said the personal friendship between Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht and then-Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman may have had a bearing on the bank's actions at the time. Government intervention . In May 1939, then British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon wrote to Norman to ask whether the bank was still holding Czech gold. In his reply, Norman did not answer the question but pointed out \"that the bank held gold from time to time for the BIS and had no knowledge of whether it was their own property or that of their customers.\" According to Blaazer, the Bank of England could not refuse to follow the order of a customer (the BIS) to transfer gold between its own accounts. He said: \"The bank claimed, and the government accepted, that this particular transaction fell beyond the governments and the banks power.\""}]}

If you're flying for the holiday, expect lots of company and few airfare deals. \"The airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and (they're) using smaller planes,\" said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com. \"So there are going to be fewer seats.\" It's also a bit trickier to book flights for Thanksgiving than Christmas because so many travelers want to fly in such a small window of time: four days versus two weeks for many people who save vacation time for the big holiday in December. The sputtering economy isn't keeping Americans from making the annual trek for Thanksgiving, said Melissa Klurman, contributing editor for Travelocity. Those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $376 on average for a domestic ticket, or about 4% more than at the same time last year, according to Travelocity. Here are five tips to make your journey a smoother one. 1. Book your tickets now . Last-minute sales aren't likely for one of the most popular times of the year to fly and seat maps are filling up quickly. \"Don't delay: Prices are not going to go down between now and Thanksgiving,\" Klurman said. \"Not only do you have a better chance of getting lower airfare, but also (better) seats. You can book your seat when you book your airfare. So if you don't want to be in the middle of the last row -- the early bird gets the window seat in that case.\" If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said. 2. Look into alternate airports . Sometimes, it pays to look into flying in and out of airports that may be less convenient than your closest option. So you may find a cheaper flight out of Allentown, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia, for example, Hobica said. Be especially flexible if you're in a major city like New York, where there are several airports in the area, Klurman said. Travelocity allows fliers to search alternate airports when they're pricing itineraries. 3. Consider flying on Thanksgiving Day . Travelers who choose to fly out on the Monday before Thanksgiving and fly back on the Sunday after will pay on average $213 more than travelers who fly on Thanksgiving Day and come back the next day, Travelocity calculated. Flying on the holiday also means much less crowded airports and planes. \"Have your turkey and then come back on Friday,\" Hobica advised. Lest you think it's impossible to do, Hobica assured that plenty of travelers have successfully gone this route, \"especially if they don't like their family or if they're sleeping on the sofa and the sleeping arrangements aren't comfortable,\" he said with tongue in cheek. In general, avoid a Sunday return, Travelocity advised. If you are flying on Thanksgiving Day, try to take the first flight out to make sure you make it to dinner. 4. Give yourself plenty of time . Connecting flights are often cheaper, but with the possibility of winter weather causing delays or cancellations over Thanksgiving, you risk a missed connection, Hobica said. He suggests travelers fly nonstop whenever possible, but if you do choose a multistop itinerary, allow lots of time to catch your next flight. If you miss a connection, Travelocity warns that with planes booked solid, it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight. 5. Consider paying some extra fees to make the trip more comfortable . Hobica frequently flies JetBlue and he always pays a fee for seats with extra legroom, an option that comes with access to expedited security lanes and early boarding. The choices vary by airlines, but several, including American and United, let you board early for a fee, thus helping you avoid the epic struggle for overhead bin space. It may be worth paying this extra charge during peak travel times, like Thanksgiving, to make the journey saner, Hobica said. Another, more expensive option is to splurge for an airport lounge day pass, which can cost $30-$50. \"If you only fly once a year, sometimes the day passes are worthwhile, especially if your flight is delayed,\" Hobica said. \"They have free drinks in most of the lounges, snacks and shorter lines if you have to rebook your flight. ... It just makes the whole experience a bit more pleasant when you treat yourself well and get the perks.\""}]}

Rodgers insists the pain of that experience will drive his players on to go one better this season, but has warned that they will be judged on the trophies they win. Wants a trophy: Brendan Rodgers is looking to lead Liverpool to success after last season's slip-up . Team spirit: But the boss insists that means no extra pressure for his side, lead by Steven Gerrard . \u2018I want a trophy this year,\u2019 he said. \u2018My sole aim in the first three years was to get us into the Champions League. I knew what it meant to the city and the supporters, so my drive in that period was to get us back. \u2018Now I want the club to win the big trophies again. That\u2019s what I said to the players. The expectancy this season is continual improvement. We want to win. To be successful is winning trophies. \u2018I don\u2019t think it puts pressure on us. We were ahead of schedule last year. I just think there is a real excitement, not pressure of last year. We know we can do it now. We embrace it and I am looking forward to this year. \u2018We\u2019ve got players who have had disappointments in their careers and picked themselves up again. We went so close but it is only the beginning for us. I\u2019m super hungry to be a champion and succeed and in the short period of time we have shown we have the credentials to do that. \u2018The Premier League is going to be as competitive as ever and we\u2019ve got the belief behind us from the early stages of the season we can win it.\u2019 Agonising: Liverpool - and Gerrard - slipped up at vital times last season, particularly against Chelsea .

They came back the following year and won it. That set up an era of winning for them. It has made us even more unified and stronger to be more successful in the future.\u2019 There are concerns about how Liverpool will cope with the loss of Luis Suarez, but Rodgers refuted suggestions that they would be perceived as a selling club after agreeing to let the Uruguay striker join Barcelona for \u00a375million.

Outbreak: Passengers on board the P&O cruise liner have been struck down by the winter vomiting bug . 'It's outrageous': Paul and Carolyn Gilman pictured in front of the cruise liner . They say around 400 holidaymakers have . been struck down by varying forms of the vomiting bug and claim they . were rudely ordered to stay in their cabins. Oriana has been hit by bouts of . norovirus several times in recent years and in 2009 one passenger on a . Baltic cruise died from the disease soon after docking in Southampton. In the latest outbreak some passengers . say they have waited hours to be seen by the ship's doctor, while . others claim they have had to put up with an overwhelming stench of . vomit below decks. And one man, who had to be treated by the ship's . doctor, was told he had racked up more than \u00a31,000 in medical bills. Passengers also claim they have been told that if they catch the virus it is their own fault for not being clean enough. Although cruise bosses say no staff are sick, one passenger said they found a steward vomiting in her cabin toilet. Tour: The ship was visiting Christmas markets around Europe, starting in Zeebrugge and Amsterdam before moving on to Hamburg (pictured inset), Copenhagen and Oslo then returning home to Southampton . Up to 300 passengers angry at a lack . of information about the situation congregated to demand action only to . be told by an officer that it was an illegal meeting and they should . disperse. Those on board said passengers began . to fall ill on the first day of the cruise and it quickly mushroomed . into an epidemic. More cleaners and two nurses are said to have gone on . board to help and extra sick bags were placed in corridors. Passenger Brian Weston, 67, a retired . security officer from the Isle of Wight, said: 'It's been a shambles . from start to finish. Passengers became ill almost immediately we set . sail and the outbreak swept like wildfire throughout the ship. 'Feelings have been running high and people are pretty mutinous.'

In May this year around 170 passengers on board luxury cruise liner the Boudicca had their dream holidays ruined by sickness. The Fred Olsen owned ship was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Scotland after a 13-day tour of the Canary Islands that was marred by a suspected norovirus outbreak. In February 3,000 passengers on board the Crown Princess had their Caribbean trip cut short when the Princess Cruise liner was ordered back to port after the vomiting bug swept through the ship.

At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week, according to a CNN team. Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO's bombing campaign. \"As soon as Gadhafi's speech ended, they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself, and it continues on the front this morning,\" said CNN's Ben Wedeman, who was in Misrata Saturday. Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya. He said the Libyan military could be \"like locusts, like bees\" in Europe, potentially targeting homes and offices. \"You are mistaken, you are involved in a battle that you don't know what you are going to face, so withdraw and run away,\" Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli. \"Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean, and able to move the battle to Europe.\" Gadhafi referred to NATO, which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi's call for vengeance. NATO's \"aggression is killing our children (and) Europe will have to face the consequences,\" he said. \"You will have people attacking Europe, joining terrorist organizations against Europe, and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe.\" Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters \"have no popular support.\" \"The rebels have no future,\" he added. \"They know it and they are terrified.\" On Saturday,  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track, with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger. \"We need to see this through, and we are in complete agreement that we will,\" she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader's remarks. \"Certainly this is an individual who's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats,\" he told reporters. \"It's what makes him so dangerous.  But he's also someone who's given to overblown rhetoric.\" He said the United States would continue to support NATO's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside. The events came one day after the African Union's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis. The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process, but stops short of saying he should step down. \"It is envisaged to convene, soon, in Addis Ababa, (Ethiopia) negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals,\" the group said in a statement. Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere.

Tony Nicklinson, 58, had been refusing food since last week, contracted pneumonia over the weekend, and \"went downhill rapidly,\" said his lawyer, Saimo Chahal. \"Before he died, he asked us to tweet: 'Goodbye world the time has come, I had some fun,'\" his Twitter account said. The former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago, and lost a High Court battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose. The fight seemed to go out of him after the court's decision, leaving him \"heartbroken,\" Chahal said after his death was announced. His wife, sister and daughters were with him when he died, she said. \"He was gutsy, determined and a fighter to the end,\" said Chahal, adding it had been \"an absolute privilege\" to represent him. His legal case will not continue unless someone \"in similar circumstances\" steps forward to pursue it, she said. Police in the county of Wiltshire, where he lived, said that a doctor had been seeing Nicklinson over the past week, and that they were not investigating the death. His condition meant it was impossible for him to take his own life, and he wanted the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution. \"Most of my body is paralyzed, but my mind is as it was before the stroke. All I can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech. Now I talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks,\" he told CNN in an interview in June. While expressing sympathy for his situation, the High Court ruled August 16 that such a significant change to the law -- involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia -- would have to be decided by lawmakers. The judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering from locked-in syndrome, named only as Martin.

The ruling upset Nicklinson, who cried as his wife, Jane, told the waiting media that the family was \"bitterly disappointed\" and would file an appeal. \"All too often, well-meaning able-bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice,\" he said in June. \"I say that where a person has the mental ability, he should have the choice of his own life or death. The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life,\" he said. In a statement given via his computer last week after the decision, Nicklinson said: \"It's not the result I was hoping for but it isn't entirely unexpected. Judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgment is not an exception to the rule. \"I believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this, but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life -- me or the state.\" His daughters, tweeting on his behalf, urged people to sign a petition via his Twitter account supporting his \"right to die with dignity.\" Within hours, thousands of people had added their names. Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die. Before his stroke at age 51, the couple lived a comfortable life in the United Arab Emirates and traveled extensively. Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the \"life and soul of the party,\" making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. \"He was a big bloke, ex-rugby player, he worked hard but he played hard,\" she said. \"He was full of life, great sense of humor, loved the sound of his own voice.\" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Sarah Chiplin, Jo Shelley, Atika Shubert, Alex Felton, Nima Elbagir, Erin McLaughlin and Dominique Van Heerden contributed to this report."}]}

The Obama administration is asking Congress for just over $17.7 billion in 2014, down a little more than 1% from the nearly $17.9 billion currently devoted to space exploration, aeronautics and other science. The request includes $105 million to boost the study of asteroids, both to reduce the risk of one hitting Earth and to start planning for a mission to \"identify, capture, redirect, and sample\" a small one. The plan is to send an unmanned probe out to seize the asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon, where astronauts would study it. \"This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we ever have before ... to places humanity has dreamed of for as long as I've been alive,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told reporters. The Obama administration has said before that it wants to send astronauts to explore an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars by 2030. Forget falling stars: NASA plans to catch an asteroid . Wednesday's budget request would include another $20 billion to study near-Earth asteroids -- doubling the current spending on that effort. The funding is aimed not only at finding a suitable asteroid to explore, but also at \"protecting the planet,\" Bolden said. That concern got new attention after February, when a nearly 150-foot asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of Earth. That one was expected -- but the same day, an unrelated, 45-foot space rock plunged into the atmosphere and exploded high over southwestern Russia, injuring an estimated 1,200 people. White House science adviser John Holdren told a congressional committee in March that as few as 10% of asteroids more than 150 yards wide -- which he called \"potential city killers\" -- have been detected. NASA's budget request includes $822 million for the agency's Commercial Crew Program, its push to resume U.S. space flights through private companies by 2017. Bolden called that the \"bottom-line\" figure, warning that any cuts would mean delays. NASA has already hired the unmanned SpaceX Dragon to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, though no commercial manned missions are currently under way. While putting money into renewed human space flight efforts, the proposal cuts scientific research, particularly the study of the other planets in our solar system. Planetary science takes a nearly $300 million hit compared to 2012, the last year detailed figures were available. NASA officials defended the cut, saying major projects like the Mars rover Curiosity and the upcoming MAVEN probe to study the Martian upper atmosphere are already past their most expensive phases. \"But of course we'll be ramping up again as we approach 2020 and the next Mars rover,\" said Beth Robinson, the agency's chief financial officer. Bolden said NASA's Mars research is the biggest part of the planetary science budget. Read more space news on Light Years ."}]}

Typhoon Hagupit -- its name means \"lash\" in Filipino -- moved west-northwest and targeted the city of Legazpi, just north of where the storm made landfall on Saturday. CNN's Saima Mohsin, reporting from Legazpi on Sunday, said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city. One of the city's major fears is a storm surge that could reach 2-4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet). With memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds, more than 600,000 people had evacuated by Saturday morning, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. About 40 million people are in the path of the storm's winds. Gen. Gregorio Catapang, chief of staff of armed forces, said at a Sunday press conference that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered. Eleven nations had offered assistance, including the Australia, the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain. He said 395 mm (15.5 inches) of rain were reported in Bororgan in 24 hours. Hagupit is moving slowly on its west-northwest track, at 15 kph (9.3 mph). At that rate, it will take about three days for the storm to travel past the capital, Manila, dumping extreme amounts of rainfall -- more than a foot in some places -- as it goes. Expected to lose some punch by Manila . Hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it reaches Manila, but winds will still be higher than 100 kph (60 mph). The biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall. That will lead to flash flooding and mudslides, even in places far away from the storm's center. Despite the threats of danger, a CNN crew in Legazpi saw many residents who were ignoring evacuation orders and vowing to stay in their makeshift beachside homes. \"I think we can handle the situation. If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center,\" one man said. \"We've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons,\" said a woman at the coast. \"This one already feels stronger than Typhoon Haiyan, but we won't leave yet.\" The typhoon came ashore on eastern Samar Island just before 10 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) with winds of 205 kph (127 mph) -- the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. Town ravaged last year escapes major damage . One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday. In Tacloban, the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated. Last year, super typhoon Haiyan devastated Tacloban, killing more than 6,000 people and making around 200,000 people homeless. Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down. Many roads were flooded, but not impassable. About 48,000 people have moved to evacuation centers, he said; there have been no casualties. CNN's Asia-Pacific editor Andrew Stephens, reporting from Tacloban, said there was no storm surge. \"The main emotion here is one of relief,\" he said. Fishermen fears typhoon will \"destroy everything\" \"There was a lot of preparation,\" Orla Fagan, spokeswoman for the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, told CNN. \"I think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in Tacloban ... because there were so many lives lost, and I think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all-out effort everywhere to bring people to safety.\" Philippines gets more than its share of disasters .

But golfers at one golf club are having to contend with a very different kind of rat-like cunning. Startled players at the North Weald club near Harlow in Essex have reported seeing a giant rodent lurking around the eighth hole. On the run: This capybara was spotted lurking around the eighth hole at North Weald Golf Club in Essex . On further investigation the 4ft-long creature was identified as a capybara \u2013 the world\u2019s largest type of rodent which is usually found grazing the plains of South America. Assistant club manager Angus Lloyd-Skinner said: \u2018A group reported seeing a giant rodent on the eighth and when we went to investigate we saw this huge creature the size of a small dog. \u2018We didn\u2019t know what it was until one of our members identified it. But we have no idea what it is doing on the course.\u2019 At first it was thought the capybara had escaped from a zoo or private collection, or had been dumped by a bored pet owner. Large size: Usually found in South America, capybaras can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs . Now Rob Dixon, manager at Ashlyns Farm Shop in Epping, has confirmed it is missing a male capybara. He said: \u2018We keep on trying to catch it, but as soon as we try and catch it,\u00a0 it\u2019s moved on or it jumps in the river and\u00a0 shoots off. \u2018Next time we\u2019ve got to get a vet out and try and tranquillise it. \u2018They run away from humans \u2013 they\u2019re quite shy. They\u2019re not like a rat, they\u2019re almost like a big hamster.\u2019 Distant relatives of guinea pigs, capybara are grazing animals native to countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, where they are farmed for their meat and skins.

Any important scandal needs a moment that turns them from a storm in the Westminster teacup to a topic of debate in The George. With MPs\u2019 expenses, it was Sir Peter Viggers\u2019 duck pond. With phone hacking, it was Milly Dowler\u2019s voicemails. And with Andrew Mitchell, it wasn\u2019t the fact that he swore at police officers; it was that much-disputed word \u2018pleb\u2019. This week, the release of secret files on HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking operations has set off a political firestorm, but as Westminster pores over the ashes and wonders where the scandal goes next, the real question is what \u2013 if anything \u2013 will get people talking down at the pub? It should be the facts that at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm to evade tax; that only one has so far faced prosecution; and that \u2013 at the height of the investigation into the case \u2013 the boss of HSBC was made a Government Minister by David Cameron. That stinks to high heaven. As someone who worked both at HMRC and at the Treasury, I am incredulous that Ministers were unaware of HSBC\u2019s involvement in the Swiss scandal when Stephen Green, the bank\u2019s former chief executive, was made a Minister. In theory, HMRC staff with access to confidential tax data are not supposed to share the details with Treasury officials and Ministers. The reality is that \u2013 whenever a case is deemed sensitive, either because of the individual or company involved, the scale of the evasion, or in HSBC\u2019s case, both \u2013 the taxman will find a way of informing the Treasury, not least to cover their backs if it all goes wrong. They will usually do so face-to-face rather than in writing so there is no record of taxpayer confidentiality being breached. In 2004, I was warned by a Revenue official that his staff were planning to present a \u00a3100,000 tax bill to a pop star while he was signing records in London. He said: \u2018Obviously, I can\u2019t tell you who it is\u2019, then walked out of my office singing Peter Andre\u2019s Mysterious Girl. But when the Swiss case emerged in 2010, it wasn\u2019t just HMRC\u2019s job to inform the Treasury of HSBC\u2019s involvement. It should have been the Treasury demanding to know what was going on, who was involved, what revenue was at stake, and what action needed to be taken. Ed Miliband was said to have seen it as an opportunity to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story involving murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler (pictured) broke . In December 2012, George Osborne announced a deal with Switzerland that he called the \u2018largest tax evasion settlement in British history\u2019. That was no small matter: the \u00a35 billion the settlement was forecast to raise allowed the Chancellor to claim that Government borrowing had fallen not risen in 2012. Are we expected to believe that he and his officials prepared that deal without ever asking HMRC what they knew about tax evasion in Swiss banks? I am reluctant to believe the Treasury is lying, and I do not believe they are wholly incompetent, so I am forced to a third uncomfortable theory. They were never told because they chose not to ask, and put their fingers in their ears when HMRC tried to tell them. Why? Because in government, once you officially know something, you have to publicly do something, or you will one day be accused of a cover-up. In this case, Stephen Green would need to have been sacked, donations to the Tories from tax evaders would need to have been returned, and prosecutions brought against those 1,000 wealthy individuals, rather than settlements agreed with them. Far better for Osborne and his Ministers to act like the wise monkeys, and hope that HSBC\u2019s involvement was never publicly exposed. THAT is the real scandal, and if Ed Miliband and his office had done their job, that is what would have been on tonight\u2019s agenda at the pub. Miliband\u2019s task was to expose the facts of the HSBC case in a way everyone could understand, and then forensically pick apart the Government\u2019s \u2018see no evil, hear no evil\u2019 defence. Instead, the Labour leader was diverted into a demeaning squabble over the tax affairs of former Tory Treasurer Baron Fink, and then broadened his assault to the entire practice of tax avoidance. This week, the release of secret files on HSBC\u2019s private banking operations- revealing at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm to evade tax- \u00a0has set off a political firestorm . Not only did that distract attention from the HSBC case, and allow Cameron to question Labour\u2019s record on tax avoidance, it has also exposed the Labour Party, its donors, peers and MPs, and Miliband himself to a frenzied media investigation into their own tax affairs. Even worse, Miliband\u2019s chief spin doctor, Tom Baldwin, then had a conversation with the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson, which led Nick to write: \u2018The Labour leader\u2019s aides say that he sees this as another Milly Dowler moment.\u2019 The BBC man clarified that the phrase was not a direct quote, but that Miliband saw this as a moment to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story broke. That Baldwin did not say the actual words \u2018Milly Dowler moment\u2019 is welcome, just as it is welcome that Emily Thornberry\u2019s picture of England flags in Rochester was not accompanied by the words: \u2018Get me back to Islington.\u2019 But what matters is the sentiment, not the words. As I noted earlier, the Milly Dowler story provoked a spontaneous outpouring of public outrage which brought the hacking scandal to national attention. Miliband did not make that happen, but he appeared to speak for the country when calling for resignations and an inquiry. Now all the public can see \u2013 based on his spin doctor\u2019s own analysis \u2013 is that Miliband was not sharing their outrage; he was exploiting it. Baldwin\u2019s thinking betrays a man who has played the Westminster chess game too long and thinks only of tactics and gambits. As someone who was a liability in my job long before I was forced to quit, I know the signs, and the fact Baldwin could not even hear how appalling his analysis sounded is one. As it is, he has ensured that if the punters\u2019 conversation in the pub does turn to this week\u2019s scandal, the cynical comparison with their anger over Milly Dowler will be what is best remembered and most guaranteed to offend. Ed Miliband has not just missed an open goal this week; he and his foolish spin doctor have crashed a spectacular 100-yard volley back into Labour\u2019s net."}]}

Chants of \"no justice, no peace\" rang into the night as crowds rallied after the Wednesday evening shooting. \"We pay you. You're our employees!\" a protester shouted. Police arrested eight people: five on accusations of unlawful assembly, two for alleged property damage and one on a marijuana possession charge, St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said. One officer suffered minor injuries and two police cruisers were damaged, Jackson said. \"I think the officers showed a tremendous amount of restraint,\" St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told CNN affiliate KMOV. Protesters also burned at least one American flag, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. That didn't go over well with some. \"These protesters in Saint louis burning American flags makes me sick,\" Twitter user AllenVA75 posted. \"brave men and women in uniform died for that flag, and they burn it?\" But others defended the burning. Twitter user PontifexMonty said \"people really getting mad that they're burning the flag in St. Louis. not about the black teens that are dead, the burning flag.\" The teenager, Vonderrit Deondre Myers, was struck by seven or eight bullets, said Dr. Michael Graham, a St. Louis medical examiner . \"All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities,\" Graham said. \"The one fatal wound was to the head.\" Police said the teen fired a pistol three times at an off-duty St. Louis officer who was wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company. The officer fired back 17 times, authorities said. Angry protesters pointed out similarities to the August killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Myers and Brown were both 18, African-American and killed by white police officers. One big difference: Police said Brown was unarmed. iReport video: Shots fired at St. Louis protest . \"It's a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty,\" Akbar Muhammad, who also is a member of a coalition calling for the officer who shot Brown to be prosecuted, told CNN affiliate KTVI. Neil Bruntrager, a lawyer for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, dismissed accusations that 17 shots were excessive. \"When he uses deadly force, he uses deadly force until the threat is gone,\" he said on \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" Without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses, the police and the public must rely on physical evidence, he said. A 9 mm pistol allegedly fired by Myers was found at the scene, police said. It was jammed, which shows that it had been fired, Bruntrager said. But Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said there's a lot of police mistrust after the Brown killing. \"You're seeing a wholesale breakdown of trust,\" he said. The officer, a six-year veteran who has not been named, was placed on administrative leave. He served two tours of duty with the military in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, Bruntrager said. While on patrol, the officer saw three men run away as he approached, Dotson said. He chased them after one held up his pants in a way that made the officer believe he may be carrying a gun, Dotson said. The officer tussled with one teen, who ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots toward him, Dotson said. The officer returned fire, killing the teen. Additional marches are planned over the weekend around the St. Louis region, organizers said. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report."}]}

The mobile payments start-up Clinkle has not even been launched yet, and already it has found itself at the center of a new scandal after someone had hacked the site to reveal a very unflattering photo of the company\u2019s 22-year-old CEO brandishing a cash fan. The embarrassing \u2018money shot\u2019 depicts tech wunderkind Lucas Duplan, a recent Stanford University graduate who came up with an app that promises to revolutionize financial transactions with a digital wallet used on smartphones. In his Clinkle profile picture, the baby-faced 22-year-old tech mogul is pictured with his mouth agape holding what was estimated to be about $30,000 in cash all in $100 bills. Money shot: This awkward profile picture of Clinkle CEO Lucas Duplan, 22, surfaced online after the yet-to-be launched mobile payments app was hacked . Clinkle immediately went into damage control mode, publicly denying that the site had been actually hacked. According to company spokeswoman Ana Braskamp, Andrew Aude, a former inter for the mobile payments company Venmo, took advantage of a \u2018visibility\u2019 feature that was being used in preliminary testing of the app, and which was meant to be disabled, NBC News reported. According to the statement, Aude also accessed Clinkle\u2019s system in September and exposed screen shots. Game changer: The app promises to revolutionize financial transactions with a secure digital wallet used on smartphones . The site TechCrunch said that this latest digital security breach has affected only 33 test users, exposing their names, phone numbers and profile pictures, which ended up PasteBin - a public text storage site. Addressing the Clinkle CEO's gauche 'money shot,' Braskamp noted that the cash in the \u2018playful, self-deprecating\u2019 picture was fake, Business Insider reported. The controversy comes at a particularly bad time for Duplan's emerging business, which made headlines last month after firing 25 per cent of its staff. Although a Clinkle engineer has reportedly dismissed the breach as 'no big deal,' it raises some serious questions considering that the start-up is promoting itself as a game-changing, secure mobile payments app. It has been rumored that Clinkle will be made available to both iPhone and Android users later this year. Clinkle is the brainchild of Duplan and a dozen of his Stanford classmates who came up with the idea back in 2011, but kept it under wraps until last year when the young entrepreneurs graduated. Funded in part by Stanford professors, the ambitious mobile payments start-up has been widely\u00a0 hailed by business insiders as the next big thing in Silicon Valley. Golden boy: Duplan (left) stunned Silicon Valley when he was able to secure $30million in investments from the likes of Richard Branson (right) and Peter Thiel .

The well-loved space-walking star tweeted on Monday a photo of all of Canadian Space Agency (CSA) colleagues waving goodbye to him, with the words: 'To say goodbye to these good people today was much harder than I expected.' Signing off: Astronaut Chris Hadfield gave a thumbs up after his last space mission landed safely last month. He tweeted his retirement yesterday . At an earlier press conference, at the CSA headquarters in Montreal, Chris said he will depart next month, leaving behind his longtime home in Houston, where he built his career as an astronaut.

His departure draws to a close a . lifetime of work as a pilot and astronaut, which began in 1992 when he . was selected as one of four new Canadian astronauts from a field of . 5,330 applicants. His first space mission would be just three years later. Emotional farewell: Chris Hadfield tweeted this picture Monday as he announced his retirement from the Canadian Space Agency, saying leaving was 'harder than expected' Tweeting goodbye: The astronaut has become an internet sensation through his prolific tweets including incredible videos and pictures from space . The military fighter pilot was first . assigned by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to the NASA Johnson Space . Center in Houston, Texas in August of the same year. His first astronaut job was to . address technical and safety issues for shuttle operations development; . he contributed to the development of the glass shuttle cockpit; and . supported shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. In addition, Hadfield was NASA's . Chief CapCom, the voice of mission control to astronauts in orbit, for . 25 space shuttle missions. From 1996 to 2000, he represented CSA astronauts and coordinated their activities as the chief astronaut for the CSA.

International Space Station (ISS) crew activities in Russia, including . the training and crew support staff. It was in Russia that Chris trained . to become a fully qualified\u00a0 flight engineer cosmonaut for the Soyuz TMA . spacecraft, and performed 'space-walks' in the Russian Orlan spacesuit. In 2003, Chris retired as a Colonel . from the Canadian Air Force (after 25 years of military service), to be a . civilian CSA astronaut. Until 2006 he was based in Houston, Texas, eventually being chief of International Space Station Operations until 2008. Chris announced on his biography webpage, that he would retire from the CSA as of July 4, 2013 'to take up new challenges'. The announcement comes less than a . month after his final space mission safely touched down to Earth, . following five months' work on the International Space Station (ISS).

The ISS is the biggest orbiting outpost ever built and can sometimes be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It consists of more than a dozen modules built by the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency. The three-man crew left the International Space Station last month landing safely on the morning of May 14. Earlier this year the first British astronaut was selected by Nasa to take part in future International Space Station missions. A former Army helicopter pilot called . Major Tim Peake was selected in May to spend six months on board the . International Space Station. Major Peake\u2019s mission will see the . 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur . in Kazakhstan in November 2015. Superstar: Chris Hadfield has developed millions of adoring fans for the YouTube videos that he has posted in his five months as commander of the International Space Station . Hadfield's most recent hit was his cover of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity' Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps. His mission will make him the first .

In May, a Russian space capsule . carrying animals including mice, lizards, newts and gerbils\u00a0 landed back . on Earth after spending a month in space. The animals were subjected to various . tests, during and after the trip, so Russian scientists could test the . effects weightlessness had on their skeletons, nervous systems, muscles . and hearts. The Bion-M capsule carrying the . animals made the successful landing in the Orenburg Region, about 745 . miles southeast of Moscow, but all the gerbils died, as did the majority . of the mice and newts. November 1995 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-74, NASA's second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the flight, the crew of Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a five-tonne docking module to Mir and transferred over 1,000 kg of food, water, and scientific supplies to the cosmonauts. Hadfield flew as the first Canadian mission specialist, the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in orbit, and the only Canadian to ever board Mir.April 2001 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-100 International Space Station (ISS) assembly Flight 6A. The crew of Space Shuttle Endeavour delivered and installed Canadarm2, the new Canadian-built robotic arm, as well as the Italian-made resupply module Raffaello. During the 11-day flight, Hadfield performed two spacewalks, which made him the first Canadian to ever leave a spacecraft and float freely in space. In total, Hadfield spent 14 hours, 54 minutes outside, travelling 10 times around the world.From 2008-09 Hadfield served as the backup for Dr. Bob Thirsk for Expedition 20/21, a long-duration spaceflight, training to live and work on board the ISS for a period up to six months. After this assignment, he supported the ISS Operations Branch and developed Emergency procedures for the ISS.May 2010 Hadfield was the Commander of NEEMO 14, a NASA undersea mission to test exploration concepts living in an underwater facility off the Florida coast. NEEMO 14 used the ocean floor to simulate exploration missions to the surface of asteroids, moons and Mars in order to gain a better understanding of how astronaut crews interact with equipment including advanced spacesuits, a lander, a rover and robotic arms.June 2010Hadfield was part of the Pavilion Lake research team, located 420km northeast of Vancouver. Pavilion Lake is one of the few places on Earth where microbialites are found. The team used a combination of remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, SCUBA divers and DeepWorker submersibles to help understand how the microbialites formed and possibly make it easier to identify potential forms of extraterrestrial life on future missions to Mars.September 2010Chris Hadfield was assigned to Expedition 34/35. On December 19, 2012 he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz, en route to becoming the second Canadian to take part in a long-duration spaceflight aboard the ISS. On March 13, 2013 he became the first Canadian to command a spaceship as Commander of the ISS during the second portion of his five-month stay in space. On May 13, Hadfield, Tom Marshburn and Roman Romanenko landed in Kazakhstan after travelling almost 99.8 million kilometres while completing 2,336 orbits of Earth. The trio spent 146 days in space, 144 of which were aboard the station."}]}

Pace High School enacted a decree in January banning officials from promoting religion at school events. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School, and Athletic Director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a non-jury trial September 17 before U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers. The statute under which they are charged carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison, subject to sentencing guidelines. Attorneys defending Lay and Freeman call it outrageous that the two are being prosecuted for \"a simple prayer.\" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains that students have a right to be free from administrators foisting their religious beliefs on them. Still, an ACLU representative said the organization never suggested that people should go to jail for violating the decree.  Watch why lawyer thinks men did nothing wrong \u00bb . The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that \"school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,\" according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9, under which district and school officials are \"permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events,\" the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. On January 28, \"Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School,\" according to court documents. \"Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members.\" Attorneys from Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman, said in a written statement that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project, all \"consenting adults.\" In a February 4 letter to district Superintendent Tim Wyrosdick in which Lay acknowledged the incident, he said that although past football booster club members \"and other adults associated with the school system\" were at the luncheon, culinary class students were in charge of food preparation and serving. Lay wrote that he asked Freeman to bless the food \"for the adults. ... I take full responsibility for this action. My actions were overt and not meant to circumvent any court order or constitutional mandate.\" In response, Wyrosdick noted in a letter to Lay that in a meeting, the principal had admitted that \"you are, and were at the date of this incident, aware of the court injunction and aware that this type of action is not permissible under the injunction.\" Wyrosdick recounted telling Lay that the prayer was not appropriate. \"This note is to share with you written instructions to avoid this type of action,\" the superintendent said. Both letters are in the public court file. \"It is a sad day in America when school officials are criminally prosecuted for a prayer over a meal,\" said Mathew Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of the law school at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. \"It is outrageous and an offense to the First Amendment to punish a school official for a simple prayer.\" Liberty Counsel said it is challenging the consent decree, maintaining that it \"unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of teachers, administrators and students.\" The ACLU, according to the Liberty Counsel statement, has begun \"to go against individual employees.\" The organization said that neither man \"willfully violated any orders of the court.\" \"We're not going after individuals,\" said Glenn Katon, director of the Religious Freedom Project for the ACLU of Florida. \"We're just trying to make sure that school employees comply with the court order.\" The ACLU did not request the criminal contempt charges against Lay and Freeman, he said; the judge initiated them after seeing a reference to the incident in a motion. And the ACLU is not involved in the criminal proceedings, he said. \"We certainly never suggested that anyone go to jail,\" Katon said. Lay is not facing jail time for praying, he said, but for violating a court order. \"The moral of this story is, for us, this is about the students' right to be free from teachers and school administrators thrusting upon the students their religious beliefs,\" Katon said. \"They keep talking about the religious rights of the administrators, but the administrators and the principals don't have any right to trumpet their religious beliefs in a school setting.\" Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district. Pace is about 10 miles north of Pensacola, Florida."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Washington (CNN)Republicans poised to take control of Congress are already threatening to kill what could turn out to be President Barack Obama's most significant second-term achievement: a nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. and Iranian negotiators are quickly approaching a November 24 deadline to reach an agreement that would freeze Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting international sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Hopes for a deal have been rising, though Obama cautioned this weekend a \"big gap\" remains between the two sides and there are powerful constituencies in each country angling against an agreement. In the United States, Republicans -- long skeptical of the talks -- are increasingly furious that Obama might sideline Congress to finalize an accord. They're especially angry that the administration might make such a move after last week's midterm elections gave the GOP -- dominated by foreign policy hard-liners -- firm control of the House and Senate. \"Like North Korea in the 1990s, Iran will use a weak deal as cover to get nuclear weapons,\" said Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, a prominent skeptic of the negotiations. Given the opposition, the Obama administration is believed to favor a framework agreement that, at least initially, would not require Congress to lift sanctions. Instead, the President would temporarily \"suspend\" them. The personal stakes for Obama are immense as he seeks to restore his footing following last week's election drubbing. A deal would elevate his legacy, which lacks a defining foreign policy triumph, and validate his vow to talk to leaders of U.S. enemies first made in a CNN campaign debate seven years ago. It would also mark a stunning diplomatic breakthrough after 35 years of estrangement between Washington and Tehran and represent a major advance on one of the world's thorniest non-proliferation problems. Some of the president's critics doubtless sense a chance to deny Obama a diplomatic win. What to expect from the lame duck Congress . But others, including some Democrats, worry that Obama is being hoodwinked by Iran. They fear the mullahs will pocket sanctions relief and then cheat their way to a nuclear bomb. Republicans could respond to what they see as a \"bad\" deal by seeking to impose new sanctions or drawing up punitive oversight benchmarks for Iranian compliance. That could so sour already tenuous confidence between Washington and Tehran that the deal could crumble. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said this weekend that he would back a \"good\" Iran deal but would \"kill\" any agreement that he found problematic. On Thursday, Graham will try to bring up a bill in the Senate that would require Obama to submit any agreement to Congress within three days for review. If he refuses, or if lawmakers vote to show their disapproval of the deal, funding for its implementation would be cutoff. And Kirk has already pledged to mobilize the new Senate behind legislation he wrote with Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez which would target Iran's oil industry with sanctions and provide a \"diplomatic insurance policy\" he says would result in a \"strong deal\" to reverse Tehran's nuclear program. Some Obama opponents on Capitol Hill reject the idea they are opposed to any deal and say an agreement is possible that would address their concerns. But they complain the White House has not worked with lawmakers to arrive at the best combination of carrots and sticks in the talks. They contend that a bad deal is now more likely because the administration has been too eager to make concessions to Iran. The White House declined to discuss its tactics. But the administration has long warned that new sanctions would upend its diplomacy and it denies accusations that Obama plans to go around Congress. Russia steps up nuclear plans in Iran as talks near deadline . Obama would be sure veto any legislation that could threaten the agreement. But Republicans could draw on skeptical Democrats to get closer to a veto proof majority of 67 Senate votes. An official with a prominent pro-Israel policy group in Washington added: \"It is not a question of doing the math. The precise change is in the leader's office. That now enables sanctions legislation to move forward.\" But other sources doubt that if it really came to it, there would be enough Democrats to challenge the president's veto and risk being accused of trashing a deal the rest of the world has embraced. But they admit the numbers are tightening. Jim Walsh, a research associate at MIT and an expert on Iranian nuclear diplomacy, predicted a fierce political battle. \"There will definitely be a fight. It will be a hard fight, but I think it will be a fight that the president can win because the consequences of failure are high,\" he said. The White House has already won one skirmish over Iran. Last year, critics sought to derail an interim nuclear deal, but failed largely because Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked sanctions bills. Obama will not have that safety net in the new Republican Senate that convenes in January, and backers of an agreement fear even the threat of tougher action. Dylan Williams, director of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel group said new sanctions would \"guarantee\" a fracturing of the international coalition against Iran. Even if opponents fail to overcome a veto, Congress could still stir up the kind of trouble that could embolden hardline opponents of President Hassan Rouhani who argue Washington can never be trusted to stick to its commitments. And a deal could not survive as \"temporary\" forever -- eventually Congress would have to act. \"It is clear there is a significant problem,\" said Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, which advocates dialogue between Washington and Tehran. \"At the end of the day, the president needs to lift sanctions through Congress in order to make a deal possible.\" The politics on Iran are getting trickier for Obama by the day. Republicans are outraged at reports last week that he wrote to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, days before the Ayatollah issued a barrage of tweets slamming the \"barbaric, wolflike and infanticidal regime\" in Israel. Meanwhile, a report by the UN's nuclear watchdog body last week suggested Tehran may have violated an interim nuclear deal by feeding natural uranium gas into one of its centrifuges. Iran was also accused of blocking existing inspections to its nuclear plants. The White House has already shown it is ready to play political hardball over Iran, warning last year that anyone who opposes the deal is effectively backing a march to war with Iran. Obama is also at odds over Iran with Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who views the prospect of an Iranian bomb as an existential threat to the Jewish state. Netanyahu warned in a video address to Jewish Federations leaders on Tuesday that it was obvious Iran wanted to remove sanctions and it should be \"equally obvious\" that it is not prepared to dismantle its nuclear program in return. The White House argues Israel's demand for a complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure is impractical. Instead, it wants the deal between the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, Germany and Iran to lengthen the period of time it would take Tehran to dash towards a bomb. \"We will not let Iran get a nuclear weapon. Period. We mean it,\" Vice President Joe Biden said in Washington Monday as negotiators from Iran, the US and Europe toiled in Oman to bridge gaps on a deal ahead of a final round of talks in Vienna next week. In the event they're successful, the pressure on key lawmakers from the White House and pro-Israel lobby groups will be intense. Incoming Republican Senate Foreign Relations committee chairman Bob Corker will be a vital player, as he has voiced skepticism of the president's Iran diplomacy in the past, while being more pragmatic than other Obama critics on sanctions. Another key player is Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is staunchly pro-Israel but could give fellow Democrats cover to stick with their president by backing a deal. And Hillary Clinton will increasingly be looked to by Democrats for guidance in the event of a deal. The former secretary of state and potential 2016 contender has backed Obama's diplomacy but expressed skepticism Iran would sign on to a verifiable deal to halt its nuclear program.\u00c2 ."}]}

The son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour did not realise he was swinging from the Cenotaph because he had grown up in the countryside without access to television, a court has been told. David Spens, Charlie Gilmour's lawyer, made the revelation about his upbringing to the Appeal Court while arguing his client's 16-month prison sentence should be reduced so he can finish his degree at Cambridge University. Mr Spens told the hearing that history student Gilmour was aware of . the significance of the Whitehall monument but 'didn't realise that the . monument from which he was swinging was a war memorial let alone the . Cenotaph.' Paying the price: Charlie Gilmour, pictured with his mother, author Polly Samson, and father Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour during his trial . Gilmour, 21, was 'out of his mind' on LSD, whisky and valium when he indulged in 'outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour' at last December's student riots. He was jailed for 16 months in July after admitting a charge of violent disorder - but his lawyer has argued that the sentence was 'unduly harsh'. Gilmour was seen swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph just hours before he hurled a bin at a car . escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. The student also jumped on the bonnet of the car, . which was carrying close protection officers, blocking the driver's view . of the Prince's Rolls-Royce in front, it was claimed. Gilmour was also accused of twice kicking a window of Top Shop in Oxford Street as staff and customers cowered inside and he was pictured setting fire to a pile of newspapers by the door of the Supreme Court during central London disorder on December 9 last year. Mr Spens argued at a hearing at the Court of Appeal that it couldn't be proved the history student was the man who threw the bin, and he 'didn't remember' doing it. Rampage: Gilmour's lawyer said he had been 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras . He also added it was still 'not too late' for Gilmour to begin his third year at University if he has his sentenced reduced and is released by October 17. Mr Spens said: 'The concern that I have on behalf of Mr Gilmour is that he is keen to know the outcome, whether there's any prosect, by the 17 October this month, for him to resume his studies. 'His case was he could remember being knocked over by the Jaguar's door, he could remember being at the side of the Royles Royce, he could remember sitting on the Jaguar's bonnet. 'He had no recollection of throwing the bin. He is confident if he threw the bin, he would have remembered'. He also argued his client had simply being 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras during the day. Disputing the length of Gilmour's jail sentence, Mr Spens claimed it was not possible to say for sure the CCTV image of the man throwing the bin was Gilmour despite the figure wearing similiar clothes. He also argued Judge Price hadn't given him sufficient credit for his guilty plea or consider his personal mitigation enough. Mr Spens said: 'I do accept on Mr Gilmour's part that anyone who takes part in violent disorder committed by a body of people adds to the overall criminality of the behaviour and therefore will receive a longer sentence than if he had committed the offence in isolation. 'A shorter, sharp shock would be perfectly sufficient to punish him, and at the same time to send a message loud and clear to others who might be minded to act as he did. 'This sentence was unduly harsh, unnecessarily so, his potential, like that of other young people in his position is being wasted while he spends too long in prison.' The dark side of the son: Charlie Gilmour was seen rampaging through the streets of London and was photographed clambering up the Cenotaph . During the sentencing hearing at Kingston Crown Court, it was said that just before his violent outbursts on December 9 last year, Gilmour had 'binged' on whisky and valium. In his mitigation, Mr Spens explained how Gilmour had become increasingly 'dependant' on drink and drugs since he was rejected by his biological father, the poet and playwrite Heathcote Williams four months before the incident. And the night before, the 'gentle' and 'promising' student had binged on LSD and alcohol. Lord Justice Hughes, sitting with Mr Justice Cranston and Mr Justice Hickinbottom, reserved judgement until next week. Lord Justice Hughes said it was important to wait for the judgement of the Lord Chief Justice in the sentences imposed on the August rioters, in case there were 'implications' for Gilmour's case. He said: 'It seems likely to us that we ought to at least see what the other court has to say about disorder, generally. 'We will reserve judgement because we need to see whether there there is any bearing on this from the judgement due in the other court.' Gilmour was adopted by rock star David Gilmour, worth \u00a378 million, when he married his mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson. The couple were in court to hear the appeal against their son's sentence, but declined to comment."}]}

The Bolivians squarely put the blame on Washington for Morales' unexpected side trip. \"Message to the Americans: The empire and its servants will never be able to intimidate or scare us,\" Morales told supporters at El Alto International Airport outside La Paz late Wednesday.  \"European countries need to liberate themselves from the imperialism of the Americans.\" Speaking alongside Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at a rally in a packed stadium in Bolivia Thursday evening, Morales said officials should analyze whether to shut down the U.S. embassy in his country. The president, who expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008, said he wouldn't hesitate to boot the embassy, too. \"Without the United States,\" he said, \"we are better politically and democratically.\" In several speeches Thursday, Morales said he had been targeted for his indigenous background. \"What happened during these days is not a coincidence, not a mistake like some governments say,\" Morales said. \"It is part of a policy to continue intimidating the Bolivian people and Latin America.\" He added, \"Our sin is being indigenous and anti-imperialist.\" Despite several attempts by CNN to get a response, Obama administration officials declined to comment on Bolivia's allegations that the United States pressured European countries to deny landing rights to the Bolivian president's plane, referring all questions to the European countries in question. Outrage in Latin America . The incident has sparked a global diplomatic feud that's roiled leaders throughout Latin America. Presidents from five South American countries -- Argentina, Ecuador, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela -- met with Morales in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Thursday to discuss the matter. Diplomatic delegations from several others South American nations joined them. The leaders issued a statement condemning the incident and calling for an apology . \"We demand the governments of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain issue the necessary public apology in relation to this serious incident,\" the statement said. The situation, they said, was a flagrant violation of international treaties. \"We reject the actions that clearly violated norms and basic principles of international law, like the inviolability of heads of state,\" they said. The leaders said they supported Morales' complaint to the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights over the matter, and they called for their countries' foreign ministers to form a committee to investigate what happened. In a statement Thursday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for dialogue between Bolivia \"and the European countries that barred the plane carrying President Evo Morales from flying over their airspaces this Wednesday.\" According to a statement issued by his office, Ban \"urges the states concerned to discuss the matter with full respect for the legitimate interests involved.\" Ecuador's Correa sharply criticized the United States for its role in the situation . In a speech Thursday at the Bolivian rally, he read an excerpt from the U.S. Declaration of Independence and decried what he said was the country's hypocrisy. \"They keep having a double standard,\" he said. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said the countries must apologize. \"At least here in South America, when we make a mistake, we recognize it and at least ask for forgiveness from those we have offended. ... Let them apologize for once in their lives for what they have done,\" she said. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blamed the CIA, saying he believes the agency pressured governments to refuse to allow Morales through their airspace. \"What just happened with the South American indigenous leader Evo Morales shows the level of madness and desperation that the (U.S.) empire has reached,\" he said. Opinion:  Snowden and a muzzled free press . So where is Snowden? The situation is the latest twist in what has become a global guessing game over Snowden's next steps. Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States. He has applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Bolivia. Snowden has been holed up at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He arrived from Hong Kong. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Morales, a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States, had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden. But Bolivian officials said accusations that an official aircraft would harbor Snowden were baseless. \"We cannot lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers,\" Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said. Snowden's asylum options dwindle . The fallout . Moscow condemned the nations that blocked Morales' path. \"France, Spain, and Portugal's actions (were) not friendly toward Bolivia and toward Russia,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. \"Moscow will demand strict observance of international law ... guaranteeing immunity of heads of state.\" France denied it refused to allow the plane to enter its airspace. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called his Bolivian counterpart to express regrets about a delay in the confirmation to authorize the plane to fly over its territory, the French Foreign Ministry said. The authorization was granted as soon as French authorities were informed the plane was the Bolivian president's aircraft, the ministry said. France \"never intended to deny president Morales' plane access to (its) airspace,\" and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France, Fabius said. France was among the countries where Snowden sought asylum. France said Thursday it had refused the request. Italy also turned down Snowden's asylum request Thursday. \"There are no legal reasons to accept this request,\" Foreign Minister Emma Bonino told the Italian parliament. Meanwhile, in Iceland, lawmakers from several political parties have proposed a new law to grant Snowden citizenship after receiving a request from the former NSA contractor, lawmaker Birgitta Jonsdottir said. On her website, Jonsdottir published what she said was the text of a letter from Snowden. \"I want to extend my gratitude to the Icelandic parliament for considering my request for Icelandic citizenship,\" he said, according to Jonsdottir. \"I have been left defacto-stateless by my own government after communicating with the public.\" Iceland has said it can't consider Snowden's request for asylum there until he's in its territory."}]}

The fugitive 'White Widow' of a 7/7 London bomber is wanted in connection with seven murders in Kenya, police have revealed. British-born Samantha Lewthwaite is alleged to have ordered the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab. Kenyan security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in. Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, otherwise known as the White Widow, is wanted for ordering the murders of seven people in Kenya including two radical Muslim clerics and two Protestant preachers . Hate preacher Aboud Rogo Mohammed was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while taking his wife to hospital on August 27 last year. Mohammed was shot 17 times as he drove along, while his wife Khania Said was shot once in the thigh. His father and five-year-old daughter, who were also in the car, were not hit. Lewthwaite was a disciple of Mohammed's and preached with him at the Masjid Musa mosque in the port-city of Mombasa, converting thousands of Somalis to fight for al-Shabaab. However, the pair fell out and a war of words began, during which Mohammed vowed to 'get rid' of Lewthwaite, who had become too demanding. He was killed nine months after she was last seen. His successor, Sheik Ibrahim Rogo, suffered the same fate last month when he was also killed in a drive-by along with associates Omar Abu Rumeisa, Salim Aboud and Gadafi Mohammed. The killings mark a rift between al-Shabaab and Lewthwaite, with security sources saying there is a power struggle between tribal elders and the White Widow. British-born Lewthwaite (left) is alleged to have ordered the execution of Aboud Rogo Mohammed (right) a hate preacher from Mombasa who was shot 17 times while driving his wife to hospital last year . Speaking to the Mirror, an intelligence source said: 'Samantha Lewthwaite is fighting for greater control of al-Shabaab which is angering the \u00adorganisation\u2019s hierarchy. 'She has become paranoid and \u00adunreliable to the group after being on the run for so long. They believe her judgement is clouded and she could find herself out on her own very soon.' Two Protestant pastors, Charles Matole and Ebrahim Kidata, are also believed to have been killed at the request of Lewthwaite. The body of Matole, 41, was found in the Redeemed Gospel Church in Mombasa  on October 19 sitting in a chair and clutching a bible. He was executed with a single bullet to the head after police questioned him over whether any young men had come to him seeking help after being asked to join al-Shabaab. Kidata's body was found dumped in bushes in the town of Kilifi, 40 miles from Mombasa, the day before Matole was killed. Gunmen attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September, killing 67 people including children as young as five. The siege, which lasted several days, ended after soldiers stormed the building and the roof collapsed . The newly-ordained preacher, of the East African Pentecostal Churches, was believed to have been strangled. East Kenya police commander Aggrey Adoli said: 'We believe Samantha Lewthwaite is behind these killings as well as a gang of others. 'We believe she is involved in \u00adrecruitment of jihadists and propagation of al-Shabaab and Al Qaeda activities in the country with other like minded individuals. Once we apprehend Samantha Lewthwaite she'll have a lot of questions to answer. 'She is without a doubt an incredible threat to national and \u00adinternational security. We are working round the clock to bring her in to stop her causing more carnage.' The officer said she is wanted on charges of 'murder and inciting Muslim youths to violence'. Interpol issued this international arrest warrant for Lewthwaite after she was named as one of the prime suspects behind the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in September . Seven of Lewthwaite's \u00addisciples, including a Tanzanian preacher, a Somali national, a Ugandan and three Kenyans, are also being hunted. Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. The mother-of-four was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and was the son of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011."}]}

Julie Davies is accused of holding thousands of parents to ransom by leading walkouts against attempts to stop her working for the National Union of Teachers. Mrs Davies, who is paid \u00a345,900 a year as an English teacher despite having been a full-time NUT rep since 2000, was suspended after local heads accused her of \u2018confrontation\u2019 and encouraging \u2018a climate of mistrust\u2019. Workers: National Union of Teachers official Julie Davies, 58 in front of striking colleagues who will walk out again for two days this week over her suspension . The 58-year-old militant is bringing two secondary schools to a standstill over her determination to organise trade union activities at taxpayers\u2019 expense. There have been growing calls for an overhaul of so-called facility time, which forces taxpayers to fund trade union organisers. Ministers said last night that taxpayers\u2019 cash must not be used to fund union reps. Mrs Davies, who bizarrely calls herself a \u2018teacher, union rep, psychokiller, obviously\u2019 on Twitter, lives in a \u00a3500,000 home in North London and has earned at least \u00a3500,000 since 2000. Strikes were carried out last week at two secondary schools in the North London borough of Haringey \u2013 Fortismere and Highgate Wood \u2013 with two further walkouts planned tomorrow and Thursday. Description: On Twitter, Mrs Davies describes herself as a 'teacher, union rep, Psychokiller, obviously' The education of up to 3,000 children is being disrupted. On her campaign website, she threatens \u2018extensive strike action\u2019. But one parent said: \u2018Many of us will lose pay because we will have to stay at home and look after the kids, while others will have to fork out for childcare. We will be billing the NUT.\u2019 Day job: Mrs Davis was released full-time from teaching duties in 2000 for union activities, but headteachers have had her suspended for allegedly encouraging \u2018a climate of mistrust\u2019 A Fortismere parent who did not want to be named said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand what relevance this has to teachers at my son\u2019s school. I don\u2019t appreciate my child being at home for another two days. He\u2019s missing a fair amount of education.\u2019 Fortismere is urging the NUT to call off this week\u2019s strikes. The mother added: \u2018I think the school are trying the best they can.\u2019 Gerard Kelly, chairman of governors at a Haringey secondary and a member of a commission that investigated education in the borough in 2012, said the strikes were \u2018absolutely unjustifiable\u2019. He added: \u2018All the secondary heads and the majority of primary heads complained about her unconstructive attitude to working with them. \u2018Why should the union expect heads to subsidise a post when the person in that post is doing their best to be uncooperative and has been for many years? They will have to back down.\u2019 In tweets earlier this year, he said she had \u2018probably been the biggest impediment\u2019 to education in Haringey since the Nazi Hermann Goering, adding: \u2018Approx 500 bombs were dropped on Haringey in the Blitz and I reckon 5 schs were badly affected. Do you think JD disrupted more or fewer?\u2019 Mrs Davies has already lost a High Court case in which she claimed Haringey Council lacked the power to suspend her. She was employed as a full-time assistant teacher by Haringey in 1992, but was elected deputy divisional secretary of the NUT for Haringey in 1997 and released from her teaching duties three days a week for union work. Her request to be released full time was granted in 2000, with Davies being elected branch secretary every year since. Mrs Davies was released from teaching English at Northumberland Park community school in North London, pictured, to carry out \u2018staff representation\u2019 full time, while still picking up her annual pay . Battle: Julie Davies has a website setting out why she and others are striking and why she believes she was victimised . In July this year, the council suspended her over claims that she breached its code of conduct. Allegations against her include claims in two letters from local primary and secondary head teachers. Both said they would not contribute to a council fund used to pay Mrs Davies\u2019 wages. The secondary heads said: \u2018Ms Davies\u2019 preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation. She seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust... rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness.\u2019 Chris McGovern, an ex-headmaster and trade unionist, said: \u2018Unions should support the right of children to be educated \u2013 not the right of this person to be paid for not doing their job.\u2019 The Department for Education said: \u2018Teachers are paid to work in the classroom. Taxpayers\u2019 money should not be funding trade union representatives who spend little or no time teaching.\u2019 Up to 800 teachers spend all or part of their working week on union work \u2013 costing taxpayers \u00a315million a year. Some are paid teaching salaries of \u00a370,000 funded by local authorities and schools, but never set foot in a classroom. Reps are usually paid from a council fund that schools contribute to. The aim is to free up a teacher for union duties without over-burdening any one school. Under the system, union officials can take \u2018reasonable\u2019 paid time off for union work, called facility time, such as representing members in employment disputes. But there are wide differences around the country in how the term \u2018reasonable\u2019 is interpreted. A TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance survey of public funding for all unions in 2012 found Birmingham, which has 1.1million residents, spent \u00a3458,000 for ten full-time education reps, while Kent, with a population of 1.5million, spent just \u00a3144,000. Guidance from former Education Secretary Michael Gove was meant to ensure union reps did more teaching and let schools rule how long they could have off."}]}

UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 24 September 2013 . Kasey Caron, 17, a student at Richland High School in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was assigned as female at birth, but identifies and presents as male . A Pennsylvania school board has denied a request from a transgender student to run for homecoming king - putting him on the ballot for homecoming queen instead. Kasey Caron, 17, was born a girl, . but identifies as a boy - including in his daily life in high school. Richland, Pennsylvania, School Board solicitor Timothy Leventry says Pennsylvania law requires a person born female to have a physician certify a sex change operation and have their birth certificate changed to legally be considered male. As a result, the Richland board refused to recognize Kasey as a boy - even though the high school senior's classmates and teachers refer to Kasey as 'him.' The Kasey's family members said they were disappointed by the board's decision. 'My heart sunk a little,' Kasey's mother Kathy Caron said. Kasey was born with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that leads to a hormone imbalance where the ovaries make more androgens \u2013 sometimes called male hormones \u2013 than normal and has had to field the question \u2018Are you a boy or . a girl?\u2019 throughout his childhood. For the bulk of his four years at . Richland High School in Johnstown, Caron's teachers and classmates have . recognized him as male. When . a guidance counselor suggested he enter his name for homecoming king at . the beginning of the school year, Caron thought the school was finally . ready to accept his gender identity, reports The Johnstown . Tribune-Democrat. But . on the day the student body was scheduled to vote for the homecoming . court, administrators told Caron that their legal counsel had informed . them they were required to list Caron's name on the female ballot, . because he is legally identified as female on his driver's license. The school board at Richland High School agreed to discuss Caron's plight at a meeting on Monday night, but ultimately no final decision was taken . Even though Caron was listed as female on the ballot, Richland students voted him onto the homecoming court. Recognizing . Caron's 'unique situation,' administrators told him he could attend the . homecoming parade with a date of his choice, rather than automatically . pairing him with another male student running for homecoming king. While Caron was considering the school's offer, his mother, Kathy Caron, and her partner, Cindy Theys, got involved and contacted various groups to mount a defense of their son. 'There . is a legal side of this issue and there is a practical side,' school board solicitor Timothy Leventry told the Johnstown . Tribune-Democrat after hearing from Kasey and other supporters. Kasey Caron has the full support of his family, including his two moms, his father, his siblings, and his transgender godmother in Maryland . 'The . school board has looked at the legal side.

I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.\" Jenner earlier told police that paparazzi were chasing him when he was in the wreck, but investigators have said there's no sign photographers following him played a role in the crash. \"That is a very regular occurrence, and (there is) no indication at this time it was a contributing factor of the crash,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Lt. John Lecrivain said. Authorities haven't determined who was at fault in the Saturday crash, Sgt. Phillip Brooks of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told CNN Sunday. They also haven't released details about the victim. Jenner first catapulted to fame after winning the 1976 Olympic decathlon and now draws the celebrity spotlight for his role on the \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" reality show. He was driving a black Cadillac SUV on Saturday that was the third vehicle involved in a multiple rear-end collision, Brooks said. The first vehicle was a black Toyota Prius, CNN affiliate KCAL reported, citing deputies. Behind it was a white Lexus sedan that also hit its brakes. Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said. The Lexus spun into oncoming traffic and was hit by a Hummer H2. The driver of the Lexus was killed. Photos published on the TMZ celebrity gossip website purported to show the moment of impact. No information about the deceased was immediately available. Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said. KCAL reported Jenner's SUV left skid marks. The wreck took place shortly after noon on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, the Sheriff's Department said. The department later opened a vehicular manslaughter investigation, a source close to the case told CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos. The investigation will focus on everyone in the case, not just one person, the source said. The Sheriff's Department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators. A deputy said Jenner voluntarily took a field sobriety test, was questioned and went home. Five children and two adults were hospitalized with injuries, authorities said. The accident occurred on a tricky stretch of the highway, where the road is narrow and twisting. In a bizarre twist to the story, a car later drove through safety barriers around the scene and struck two of the cars from the initial accident, Cmdr. Mike Parker of the Sheriff's Department tweeted. The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote. Jenner won the 1976 Olympic decathlon with a world record score for the 10-discipline event. He quickly capitalized on his success with Wheaties commercials, appearances and other ventures. He became an actor, appearing in the drama \"CHiPs\" in 1981 and occasionally playing himself on shows such as \"Silver Spoons.\" More recently, he has gained fame as the well-known stepfather of Khloe, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian on their family's E! entertainment network reality show.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will generate concise, entity-dense summary of the given article. Only generate the summary text. Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company's lack of management diversity -- that is, women. As The New York Times put it last week, \"The board? All white men. The investors? All men. The executive officers? All men but for the general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks.\" Question: Why is this a problem? First, there aren't enough women at Twitter or in the tech world because there aren't enough women anywhere. Some facts: Women make up 6% of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies, and that has taken years to accomplish. Most startups have all-male boards. In 2012 women held 16.6% of Fortune 500 board seats. Women of color were 3.3% of the total. Fully one-tenth had no women serving on their boards at all. In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability. Twitter had more than a year to prepare for this IPO: Where are the women? The company's immediate response  focused on a \"paucity of candidates.\" The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system. However, companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes, yes, even women -- when seeking senior-level and board positions. It enables them to cross-pollinate ideas, diversify their expertise and innovate. For example, Apple has hired Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts. During her tenure at Burberry, the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price. Companies redefine \"pipeline\" every day -- particularly when profits are involved. The technology sector dresses itself up as progressive when in reality it shows every indication of being, at its core, powerfully retrograde. Despite investing in diversity programs, the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse, and indeed the industry continues to \"dazzle\" with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases. Last month's Titshare debacle (click and weep), as well as Business Insider's long-overdue firing of CTO Pax Dickinson (who'd for years been churning out such sexist, racist, tweets as \"Jesus gets raped by a pack of n****s. It's his own fault for dressing like a whore though\") are two recent examples. Second, sexism is seamlessly coupled with the distribution of capital. Bryan Goldberg's September launch of Bustle, a \"women's centric\" website (\"world news and politics alongside beauty tips\") was a blunt force case in point. After announcing the site with a tone-deaf post, Goldberg was widely mocked for his personal failure to grasp, among other things, how ridiculous his claim to be starting the \"first site of its kind\" for women was. The real issue isn't Goldberg's cluelessness, but the institutional biases that enabled him to raise $6.5 million when far more able, knowledgeable and experienced women can't. Companies with at least one woman founder make up only 13% of those funded. Venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors. These are particular ironies since women-run startups use 40% less capital to launch. These facts don't reflect women lacking in confidence ideas. They illustrate discrimination, whether it is conscious or not. Third, while we think of Twitter as a tech company, it is a media company and part of a larger environment that does little to correct its failure at diversity. Year after year, studies such as one last week from the Directors Guild of America, as well as reports from Who Makes the News and the Women's Media Center Status on Women in Media document exactly how distorted mainstream media ownership, management and production remain. Only online is the situation improving. But even there the difference is largely gains in women-oriented \"pink-collar\" content. How can we separate these facts from ownership? We can't. As reported by the Federal Communications Commission, our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men. Lastly, what does this have to do with speech? Everything. Male experiences, interests, expectations and voices, mainly white, inform the way we think, decide how our resources are dispersed and define our norms. The ghettoized status of women and minorities in media and technology, coupled with the lack of venture capital investments, means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited, misrepresented and regularly repackaged to make what we say palatable to a sexist status quo. And this status quo is entirely uninterested in the idea of women as capable, autonomous leaders who might change norms in unsettling, risky ways. Stating these facts baldly is not an indictment of white men as individuals. It is a description of systemic problems that we refuse to confront with systemic solutions. The presence of a carefully selected handful of women in tech, regardless of how determined, able and prominently visible they are, has for decades done little to alter the makeup of management and ownership.  Gender diversity at Twitter, as elsewhere, isn't a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they believe will be profitable and successful: Twitter is looking for experience and expertise within a comfort zone. \"This to me is not a gender issue, it's an innovation issue,\" Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has explained. Gender issues aren't innovation issues only if your gender is dominant and the norm. This rationale, and others like it, are exactly the kind of \"1,000 paper cuts\" marginalization that result in fewer women pursuing  tech careers to begin with. Twitter is one part of a male dominated social structure, economy and culture, all of which rely on cradle-to-grave sexism to be profitable. That's tweetable by the way."}]}

Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's deputy foreign minister, insisted the rules would have to apply to Britons as well as workers from other parts of Europe. Mr Cameron used his long-awaited immigration speech last week to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership. Scroll down for video . Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's deputy foreign minister, insisted new rules on curbing access to benefits would have to apply to Britons as well as workers from other parts of Europe . Under the Prime Minister's plans, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. Mr Cameron admitted that his proposals would require treaty change but would need support from across the EU to push through such measures. Mr Trzaskowski said it was an 'absolute red line' for his government that there is no discrimination in the welfare system on grounds of nationality. He said the plans to stop migrants from claiming benefits for the first four years after they arrive in Britain as well as kick out those who fail to find work after six months would go against all existing laws and insisted Poland would oppose the plans as they stand. David Cameron has threatened to block any new members joining the European Union without limits on their citizens flocking to Britain for work . FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer . Deportation if they do not get a job for six months . Other measures include: . Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU . Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK . Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals . Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels . Mr Trzaskowski told BBC Newsnight: 'If one wants to get away with all the benefits that are enshrined in the regulation of EU and treat immigrants from EU differently, and for example only pay benefits after four years of their stay in Britain or extradite people who can't find work, that would be against all the existing laws of the EU and obviously that would be a red line for us.' 'The Polish government is quite ready to talk about abuses of existing systems, sham marriages, extraditing criminals and so forth. 'But to be truthful this is not the problem, it is marginal. When it comes to changing the rules in the EU, when it comes to social support and so forth, when it comes to undermining the existing laws, obviously we are going to react quite strongly and we are going to be against. 'But the most important thing is that David Cameron wants to talk about it and doesn't want to change policies unilaterally.' He added: 'This is an absolute red line, that there is no discrimination on grounds of nationality. If Britain were to change its policy, for example, into contributory system in which everyone has to pay in to get some money from the system we then could talk about changes if they were absolutely non-discriminatory.' Mr Cameron made clear that without agreement on allowing the UK to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to EU migrants, he will 'rule nothing out' \u2013 raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. In an apparent attempt to win the support of countries like Poland, he appealed to other European nations who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent. But he warned Britain will veto any new countries joining the EU unless he gets his way on imposing limits on workers from poor countries moving in search of work."}]}

Ofsted guidance at the heart of a major row over \u2018inappropriate\u2019 questions fired at primary pupils can be revealed for the first time today. For years inspectors have been internally briefed that they can quiz pupils aged four to 11 about the word \u2018gay\u2019 and same-sex families, it has emerged. They have been told to ask young children if classmates are ever picked on for not behaving like a \u2018typical girl\u2019 or a \u2018typical boy\u2019. And since 2013 Ofsted briefings have also urged inspectors to tackle \u2018transphobic\u2019 bullying, by asking primary children if they think someone \u2018born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl\u2019 would feel safe at their school. Ofsted has repeatedly denied that youngsters have been questioned about \u2018inappropriate\u2019 topics since the introduction of new rules last year requiring schools to promote \u2018British\u2019 values. Last week, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, told the Commons\u2019 education select committee that he had conducted a \u2018thorough\u2019 investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false. But as early as January 2012, the schools watchdog published a briefing for inspectors, telling them they could quiz primary pupils about aspects of homophobic bullying such as the use of the word \u2018gay\u2019 in school. In September 2013, the watchdog produced a new document, Exploring The School\u2019s Actions to Prevent and Tackle Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying, which endorses asking primary pupils wide-ranging questions about homosexuality and transgender. It said: \u2018Inspectors should make sure that questions are age-appropriate and asked in the right context. \u2018With primary pupils inspectors might explore whether pupils ever hear anyone use the word \u201cgay\u201d when describing something, or whether they have been told by teachers that using the word \u201cgay\u201d, to mean something is rubbish, is wrong, scary or unpleasant and why it is wrong.\u2019 Other topics to discuss included whether \u2018pupils ever get picked on by other children for not behaving like a \u201ctypical girl\u201d or a \u201ctypical boy\u2019\u2019\u2019, and if they had lessons about \u2018different types of families (single parent, living with grandparents, having step-parents, having two mums or two dads)\u2019. This guidance, last issued in April 2014, also suggested inspectors could discuss with primary children if they thought \u2018someone born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl\u2019 would \u2018feel safe at school and be included\u2019. Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination \u2018persisted\u2019 there . Durham Free School is to close after a damning report which claimed pupils held 'discriminatory' views . At secondary level, inspectors were told to explore with students whether a pupil or teacher \u2018who thought of themselves as the opposite gender, feels safe and free from bullying at school\u2019. This \u2018briefing for section 5 inspection\u2019 \u2013 along with other Ofsted documents \u2013 were replaced by a new, single School Inspection Handbook, officially published last September, which makes no reference to these types of questions. Two months later, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland and Durham Free School were inspected by Ofsted. Grindon Hall, which has been put into special measures after children were labelled intolerant, has accused inspectors of questioning ten-year-olds about whether they knew what lesbians \u2018did\u2019, and if any of their friends felt trapped in the \u2018wrong body\u2019. And Durham Free School is set to close after Ofsted said some children displayed \u2018discriminatory\u2019 views towards people of other faiths. Governors have claimed that inspectors asked pupils questions including \u2018do you know anybody in the school who is gay?\u2019 It is also alleged a girl of around 12 was asked if she was a virgin. Simon Calvert, of The Christian Institute charity, said: \u2018It does look like Ofsted inspectors continue to be influenced by this guidance. \u2018Sir Michael Wilshaw needs to take responsibility for the actions of his inspectors. He also has to take responsibility for the fact that guidance has been issued that has created a culture within Ofsted where inspectors think it\u2019s appropriate to talk to young children in these ways.\u2019 An Ofsted spokesman said: \u2018Last year, Ofsted replaced a number of individual guidance documents with a new, single inspection handbook, in line with our new approach to placing more emphasis on training for inspectors rather than a reliance on extensive written guidance.\u2019"}]}

She's best known for solving complex mathematical problems on Channel Four's cult show Countdown. And now Rachel Riley has turned her brilliant mind to figuring out something we all want to know - who will win this summer's World Cup. The Manchester United fanatic and Oxford graduate has been poring over all the data from World Cups down the years to try and pinpoint the patterns that will tell us which team will lift the famous trophy in the Maracana on July 13. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Behind the scenes with Rachel Riley on World Cup shoot . World Cup tips: Countdown presenter Rachel Riley has crunched the data ahead of the big kick-off in Brazil and tipped Chile as the winner . Heading for glory? Chile are the fancied team after Rachel's calculations, which took into account dozens of different factors . And, in an outcome that may raise a few eyebrows, all the statistics point to outsiders Chile. Commissioned by bookmaker Ladbrokes, Rachel took into account a diverse range of factors including goal average, goal scorers, win rates, climate and geography in a mathematical formula to try and find a winner. She found that since the Mexico World Cup in 1986, performances in the qualifying competition have had a significant influence on the outcome of the tournament. The key is not to peak too soon and to do just enough to qualify with a win rate of between 50 and 66 per cent. Close control: Rachel shows off her ball skills but, despite the top, doesn't believe England will advance too far in the competition . It all adds up: A combination of Chile's win ratio, qualifying campaign and FIFA ranking suggests they will be dark horses in the finals . This is bad news for the likes of Germany and Holland, who raced through their qualifying groups and won 90 per cent of their games, and also Belgium (80 per cent) and defending champions Spain (75). Chile's qualifying win rate of 56 per cent is just about perfect. The second biggest influence according to Rachel are the goal scoring averages. The previous seven world champions only averaged 2.1 goals per game through the qualifying rounds. Unfortunately, this rules out England, who averaged over 3 goals a game in their 10 qualifying matches. Relying on one star player is not the key to success either. Top scorers in previous World Cup winning teams scored an average of 4.85 goals during qualification. Place your bets: Rachel recommends you put your money on outsiders Chile to lift the trophy in the Maracana on July 13 . Show your working: Rachel looked in detail at every tournament since 1986 in order to draw her conclusions . This time round, Luis Suarez scored 11 and Lionel Messi 10, knocking both Uruguay and Argentina out of the equation, but their South American neighbours Chile had Arturo Vidal and Eduardo Vargas on five goals each. The fact no nation from outside Europe and South American has ever won the World Cup rules out a swath of teams. And no team with odds of 100-1 has ever prevailed either. No European team has ever won on South American soil, removing France, Portugal and Italy from the mix, leaving Brazil, Colombia and Chile. The next factor was that no pre-tournament favourites have lived up to their billing since 1986 and so Brazil - priced at 3-1 - aren't going to do it. It now boils down to omens and human reasoning - Colombia have the easier group but are without star man Radamel Falcao. Big fan: Rachel received a signed Manchester United shirt from Ryan Giggs to mark her 1,000th appearance on Countdown . Glamorous: Rachel competing in BBC show Strictly Come Dancing last year . Chile have the stronger squad and won 2-0 at Wembley against England back in November - 66 per cent of teams to do so at the new Wembley have been World Cup finalists. Explaining her decision, Rachel said: 'Having crunched all the numbers and stats my maths suggests Chile are a good bet to upset the odds at 40/1. 'They might be amongst the outsiders, but the statistics and form imply they will be this year\u2019s dark horses. They\u2019ve got a decent team, and although it\u2019s a tough group, they tick all the boxes and I\u2019m convinced Chile can go all the way. 'Everyone thinks the winner will come from one of the top 10 teams, but the key stats on qualifying performance, goals scored, goalscorers, host nation and current outright odds suggest the likes of pre-tournament favourites Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany, Italy and France will be going home empty handed. 'As for England, I\u2019ll be cheering on Roy\u2019s Boys, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be their year.'"}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- In less than a week, Turkey will hold its first direct presidential election, yet the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric. This is strange given the usual excitement around elections in Turkey, the historic importance of this poll, and the exceptionally high level of socio-political tensions in recent years. Besides the summer heat and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the relative lull might be explained by the widespread anticipation that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, candidate of the ruling AKP, will emerge triumphant from the ballot box, in either the first or the second round. Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in Turkey's modern history. He has a tightening grip over all key state institutions, save perhaps the Constitutional Court. He also has a deeply emotional relationship with his followers, who rally around their leader more passionately as he faces stiffer opposition to his increasingly personal rule. This is how he has survived massive anti-government protests, a damaging feud with former Islamist allies and a high profile corruption scandal, an appallingly mismanaged industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles -- latest being the abduction of 49 Turkish diplomats and consulate workers in Mosul by ISIS militants, whose rise some critics attribute in part to the AKP government's open border policy for jihadis fighting in Syria -- all in the space of a year. This might also explain the somber mood around many of his opponents, who seem to believe that having come so close to realizing his long standing ambition of becoming Turkey's first popularly elected president, Erdogan will not let the opportunity slip. But the lull should not overshadow the critical importance of the election. To be sure, an Erdogan victory would amount to no less than regime change for Turkey. It would mark the most crucial step yet in its decade-long transformation from an imperfect parliamentary democracy under military tutelage towards a \"plebiscitarian democracy\" -- characterized by a powerful executive, a weak or compliant legislative, and a charismatic leader-follower relationship that is periodically reaffirmed in general elections and referenda. One would be mistaken to think of the presidency, under Turkey's existing parliamentary system, as a ceremonial post that would deprive its occupant of the executive powers of a prime minister. Turkey has had ambitious presidents, such as Turgut Ozal (1989 -- 1993) and Ahmet Necdet Sezer (2000 -- 2007), whose influence was checked by hostile lawmakers or meddlesome generals. A President Erdogan wouldn't face these obstacles: his party controls the parliament and the military has been tamed through EU-backed reforms and two highly politicized court cases. The current constitution, drawn up by the military junta in 1982, gives the head of state significant authorities, which Erdogan would push to the limit by invoking the \"national will\" he claims to embody; a claim that would be further reinforced and personalized in the event of his election. Where would this scenario leave those who feel increasingly alienated, stifled and marginalized in Erdogan's new Turkey? Another electoral loss would be sure to further dispirit those who hoped to see some change to the political status quo after the Gezi protests of last summer. But in defeat, there might be a valuable and necessary lesson. The two main opposition parties -- the secular republican CHP and the nationalist MHP -- have formed an informal coalition for the sole purpose of posing a numerical challenge to the AKP's relative majority, with anti-Erdoganism being their chief unifying cause. Party leaders have handpicked candidates and determined election strategies with minimum public consultation. Only a handful of people were involved in the selection of Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the former secretary-general of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, as the two parties' joint candidate for presidency. Predictably, this uninspiring, ultra-pragmatic, top-down tactic came short in the local elections (even when one takes into account the allegations of voting fraud, the AKP remains the clear overall winner) and risks failing in the presidential one. More importantly, this style of politics is inimical to the grassroots, democratic and pluralistic vision that the \"Gezi spirit\" has aspired to capture. Whatever the outcome of the presidential election, those who wish to see this vision transformed into reality would be better served by focusing on the long term process rather than short term gains, and on building organizational capacity at the level of local politics instead of obsessing over the control of state institutions in Ankara. Success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics, as Turkey's political Islamists have shown time and again over the past two decades. But a true democratic transformation also requires devolution of political authority. Since its foundation as a republic 91 years ago, Turkey's excessively centralized political architecture has allowed those who attain control of the state to force their will on the entire population. The machinery that repressed ethnic minorities and pious Muslims in the past is now alienating non-practicing Muslims, Alevis, LGBTI members and other social and political minority groups who do not fit in with Erdogan's vision of an overtly religious neo-liberal Turkey. Only a well-organized movement that takes its strength from local politics and stands for pluralism, decentralization and democratic rights and liberties of all citizens can break this vicious cycle of suppression and alienation.

Keli Lane previously appealed her conviction for the murder of her daughter Tegan at the Supreme Court of NSW in 2010 . Baby killer Keli Lane's last hope of overturning her murder conviction has been lost, after the High Court rejected her bid to appeal. Lane was found guilty in 2010 of murdering her newborn daughter Tegan Lee Lane within hours of leaving Auburn Hospital in September 1996 with the baby, whose remains have never been found. After leaving the hospital the 39-year-old water polo player then went to her parents' home, before attending a wedding that afternoon. In 2011 she was jailed for a maximum term of 18 years. She is currently incarcerated in Australia's toughest women's jail, Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre in western Sydney. Currently, Lane would not be eligible for parole until she has served thirteen years and six months, on May 12, 2023. Her appeal to the High Court was her final avenue to have her murder conviction overturned, following a rejected bid by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal last December, which reportedly had her distraught and hyperventilating in her Silverwater jail cell. But on Friday, Australia's highest court rejected her application for special leave to appeal. Keli Lane was almost one of Australia's golden girls \u2013 a private schoolgirl and talented sportswoman with hopes of representing her country at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. But it all came crashing down due to a secret she kept for 14 years \u2013 the baby girl who vanished within days of her giving birth \u2013 and today convicted child murderer Keli Lane lost her last desperate bid to win freedom from jail. Lane (pictured left in 2006 attending court and right in 1996 at a friend's 21st) gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane in 1996. Two days later she attended a friend's wedding without the baby, who was not seen again . Tall, blonde Keli Lane was a familiar and admired figure in the Sydney surfside suburb of Manly before her stunning and tragic fall from grace. She is the daughter of a well-known surfer, rugby player and retired NSW police inspector, Robert Lane. An elite water polo player at national and international level, Lane was a member of the silver-medal winning Australian Junior Women's team at the 1995 World Championships in Quebec, and it was her ambition to represent Australia in water polo at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. It was perhaps this that led to her disposing of her baby - Lane became pregnant, but could not afford to care for child while pursuing her sporting ambitions. On 12 September 1996, Lane, aged 21, gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane at Auburn Hospital in western Sydney. Two days after giving birth to the child, Lane and her boyfriend attended a friend's wedding and there was no sign of the baby, nor were people aware of her pregnancy - including her boyfriend. It was as if the child had never existed. Keli Lane (right) was an elite waterpolo player and hoped to represent Australia in water polo at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games . Lane had a troubled history with pregnancies, which she had either terminated or given away the child soon after birth. She finally had a fourth child, who now visits Lane in prison. Lane's downfall came when a Department of Community Services officer became suspicious about the existence of a missing child and an investigation was made into the birth of Tegan. Lane first told police that Tegan was living with a family in Perth. She said the father was a man called Andrew Morris, which she later changed to Andrew Norris, and that she had handed him the child in the Auburn Hospital car park. After a controversial - and traumatic four-month trial - Lane was convicted in December 2010 of lying under oath and of murdering her baby Tegan. A supplied photograph taken on August 10, 1996, shows Keli Lane (left) one month before she gave brith to her daughter Tegan ."}]}

Scotland Yard said the dangerous criminals were only uncovered thanks to a drive to discover the backgrounds of overseas suspects. Officers said improved checks revealed a previously undiscovered stream of foreigners with a history of serious crime. Staggering: Scotland Yard has found that there are more than 40 'predatory rapists' living in London who have already been convicted abroad of sex crimes . As a result police have pledged to . throw hundreds of foreign suspects out of the country every week, even . when they have not been convicted of a crime. Immigration judges will be asked to . deport rapists, thugs and thieves on the strength of \u2018intelligence . dossiers\u2019 collected by investigators. Serious offenders can be thrown out . even when they have not been convicted if an immigration tribunal deems . them a danger to the public. In one recent case a 46-year-old . Jamaican drug addict rapist was thrown out of the country after being . linked to a string of sexual offences in South London. Despite remaining unconvicted, an immigration tribunal ruled Lincoln Farquharson was a danger to the public and deported him. One in three arrested in the capital \u2013 around 70,000 people every year \u2013 is a foreign national. Metropolitan Police Commander Steve . Rodhouse said police are working with immigration officials to . investigate the past of all foreign suspects. He said: \u2018Our work gives us much . better knowledge of those people in the UK and how they are offending. We have identified more than 40 predatory rapists convicted overseas in . the UK who we would otherwise not been aware of. \u2018These are people who are getting arrested for low level crimes like shoplifting and are exposed after further checks.\u2019 Kicked out: Jamaican Lincoln Farquharson had been charged with multiple rape and has been deported and banned from returning to the UK for at least 10 years. Top officers at Britain\u2019s largest . force are concerned that a quarter of those arrested for serious crimes . and links to gangs are foreign. They are stepping up their efforts to . deport foreign criminals and hope to increase the number from between 30 . and 50 a week to \u2018three figures\u2019.

These captivating images of a breathtaking seaside villa may look like they're computer generated, but they are pure unadulterated architectural reality. Nestled in Cape Town's cliff-side, the work of architectural art by South African design duo Greg Truen and Stefan Antoni of SAOTA has a 'seamless flow' between the natural beauty outside and the stunning modern interior.

'I love the triple volume gallery space they have created inside and praise how the master bedroom floats over into the double volume living space with a striking soft s-curve cantilever.' 'To the rear of the site you can sit and . enjoy the mountains. This level enjoys 270 degree views from Lion\u2019s Head . at the rear to the Bantry Bay ridge on the North and the dramatic sea . views over the Clifton beaches to the West,' she adds. The garden is designed to be protected from infamous Cape Town wind, but still has incredible views of the dramatic landscape . Kick back and relax: The natural tones and organic materials add to the laid back feel in the villa's main lounge . 'On speaking to the architects they told me how the brief was to create a building that maximised the connection with the view and the sea, create a garden on the mountain side of the site and to minimise views over neighbouring buildings. 'I know their team has done this perfectly! The pictures say it all,' she says. For more of Celia's favourite extravagant houses, go to her new blog Posh Property.

Next time you ride your fixed-gear bicycle to the the thrift store, where you find a vintage, grease-stained mechanic's shirt that matches your Rollie Fingers mustache and Grizzly Adams beard, there's an edgy, if technologically sub-optimal, way to tell your friends about it. Use a flip phone. In an age of the iPhone 6 Plus and massive Android phablets, flip phones are inexplicably making a comeback. No less an arbiter of cool than Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour has apparently dumped her iPhone in favor of a flipper. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, actress Kate Beckinsale and even Rihanna are just a few of the celebrities spotted proudly brandishing the famous piece of paleo-technology. And, believe it or not, \"dumb phones\" aren't exactly the elusive unicorn that some of us think they are. As of January, 56% of American adults owned smartphones, compared to a total of 90% who had a cellphone of some kind, according to the Pew Research Internet Project. Among millennials age 18-29, an overwhelming 83% of those who owned cellphones had a smartphone, but that leaves the other 17% who keep their mobile life more basic. The hinged, snap-shut \"flipper\" form factor was originally introduced to the public in 1982 by laptop manufacturer GriD with its Compass computer. Motorola, perhaps the king of flip phones with its Razr line, introduced the clamshell style in 1996 with its StarTAC phone (which, appropriately enough, was re-released for nostalgic techies in 2010). Is this really all about going for retro, hipster street cred? There is, at times, a mystifying aspect of \"cool\" that centers around eschewing modern convenience for vintage ... well ... inconvenience. Writing on typewriters? Check. Racing high-wheel bicycles from the 1880s? Yes. Playing baseball with the rules and equipment of the 1860s? Absolutely. But there are obviously some more practical reasons some people, including millennials, go flip. For some, it's about simplifying and uncluttering in a 24/7 plugged-in society. \"It just seemed like it would be better for my addled brain than a smartphone,\" 26-year-old Angelica Baker, a tutor and writer, told TIME. \"Personally I'm too scattered and unfocused to handle email and Facebook on my phone.\" Baker swapped out her Droid for her mom's retired flip phone, a pink Motorola Razr. No one has to worry about the iCloud being hacked when they use a flip phone. There's little to no eye and neck strain. No fear of Flappy Bird addiction. And, let's be honest ... there's something satisfying about a switchblade-like phone flip after an annoying phone conversation that even the most emphatic tap of a touchscreen will never approach. Maybe the hipsters are onto something after all. Though we'll still pass on the bushy beards."}]}

You can never prepare for how the ever-shifting landscape will seek to change something within you as well. The larger-than-life grandeur of its towering city skyline, fleet of construction cranes signaling progress and crowded, fragrant souks -- or markets -- all combine to present the swirling scene of Dubai. But in order to soak up Dubai's eclectic diversity, you have to prepare for another truth: \"Dubai is worth a trip, but not all that glitters is gold,\" iReporter Holger Bauer said. Knowing how to navigate the city is key to making the most of your trip. But don't let a fear of the unknown keep you from setting off on a Dubai adventure. \"It's a crossroads of many cultures,\" iReporter Derek Matthew Koebbe said. \"They have a 30-year plan to become one of the largest economic and tourist regions in the world. I would love to travel there again to see this progression.\" Dubai's captivating mystique, beauty . City with a view . For first-timers or repeat visitors, taking in the breathtaking view of Dubai from the top of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is a must. \"You can get a very good view and 'lay of the land' by going up to the top floors of buildings, such as hotels or the Burj Khalifa,\" Anderson said. \"Going to the viewing deck of the Burj Khalifa in the evening is especially magical. You can view the nightlife below as well as the dancing fountains show, which is absolutely spectacular at night.\" iReporter Sara Ruedy recommends taking the elevator ride up to the 160th floor for a 360-degree view of Dubai's overall splendor. And while visiting the Burj Khalifa, located in the heart of downtown Dubai, don't forget to explore the \"large variety of trendy restaurants, aesthetic pools and fountains, and upscale shopping,\" she said. What to do, where to go . Dubai is full of activities that cater to any traveler's whimsy. From the adventurous recreationalist to the avid shopper, this city is a treasure trove just waiting to be explored. \"The malls are epicenters of activity and entertainment, from indoor ice skating and downhill skiing to aquariums, and of course, the high-end luxury shops,\" Anderson said. Dubai is known for its array of fountains, so take the time to stop and enjoy the show. The Dubai Mall, the largest mall in the world, features a choreographed fountain show, according to Anderson. \"One of the best ways to view the shows, which run regularly throughout the day, is to grab a seat for lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants in the mall with outside terrace seating. The food is delicious as well!\" Ruedy agrees with Anderson when it comes to the food at Dubai's main mall. \"I ate at a Lebanese restaurant named Karam Beirut within The Dubai Mall. The restaurant was unique in that large plates of every fresh vegetable you can think of were provided during the meal, creating a hearty and healthy eating experience.\" Dubai, home of the extravagant, also has the world's only 7-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab. But if you can't afford a stay in 7-star luxury, the city has other agreeable options. \"I would recommend staying at any of the Jumeirah properties, as they are on the beach,\" Koebbe said. \"They have Burj Al Arab as well as the very affordable Madinat Jumeirah. The Madinat has a water park called Wadi Wadi that kids really enjoy! The property also has a replica of a traditional souk with over 40 shops and restaurants.\" If you haven't satisfied your shopping needs at the world's largest mall, don't forget to browse Dubai's souks. \"Another must see is the gold and spice souks near Dubai Creek,\" Koebbe said. \"Be ready to bargain because they raise the prices for any foreigners.\" 30 days, 30 kitchens: Making food in the UAE . How to explore . Before you begin, consider Dubai's climate. Koebbe captures it best: \"Think of Florida's humidity combined with Arizona's heat. Average summer temps are 100-plus with 80% humidity. The best time to travel there is between November and March when the highs are in the 80s and the humidity is lower.\" Once you get there, take a ride on the Dubai bus system for a fun way to sightsee. Getting around the city for a dime each trip is easy on your wallet, and it helps you connect with the locals and tourists around you, Bauer said. If you want to explore Dubai's more natural offerings, get outside the city. The countryside and deserts are a nice balance for the towering skyline. \"It's wonderful to get into the countryside and see Al Ain or Abu Dhabi, not far away,\" iReporter Eric Kossoff said. \"We took a half day tour with Arabian Adventures called 'The Sun Downer,'\" Koebbe said. \"They pick you up a few hours before sunset from your hotel and take you into the Al Sahara Desert where you visit a traditional Bedouin camp. The camp provided everything from camel rides to hookahs and traditional foods along with belly dancers.\" Take in the diversity . If you take one thing with you from your Dubai experience, let it be the culture. You won't find a replacement for it anywhere on Earth. \"Dubai is such a beautiful and uniquely diverse destination,\" Koebbe said. \"Wandering through the souks, you hear people speaking in Arabic, British and American English, Hindi, Russian, French and even Chinese. The city has both an old and new feel all around it. \"Wonderful smells of the spice souk are wafting around you mixing with the fragrances of some of the finest perfumes Europe has to offer. You'll find older traditional souks on one corner, then on the next, the very American-like Mall of the Emirates with an indoor ski resort, Ski Dubai. I found the local people to be very warm and welcoming.\""}]}

I don't know why the girl had me say those things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview set to air on Monday. \"You're saying you were set up?\" Cooper asked. \"Well yes, I was baited,\" Sterling said. \"I mean, that's not the way I talk. I don't talk about people for one thing, ever. I talk about ideas and other things. I don't talk about people.\" Sterling, an 80-year-old married lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, hasn't spoken publicly about the accusations since celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording of him that drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league. In that audio clip, Sterling chastised friend V. Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. The recording triggered a firestorm that led to Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. \"I'm not a racist,\" Sterling told Cooper. \"I made a terrible, terrible mistake. And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I've hurt.\" Asked by Cooper why he took so long to say he's sorry, Sterling said he was \"emotionally distraught.\" \"The reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong. I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it,\" he said. Sterling said he doesn't want his comments to eclipse his lengthy tenure with the NBA. \"I'm a good member who made a mistake and I'm apologizing and I'm asking for forgiveness,\" he said. \"Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again.\" Now, Sterling said, his fate is in the league's hands. \"If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me,\" he said. 'I thought she liked me' Last week, another audio recording surfaced online, allegedly showing Sterling trying to add context to the racist comments that got him banned from the league. In that recording, Sterling purportedly explained that his comments were driven by jealousy. \"The girl is black. I like her. I'm jealous that she's with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell, can I in private tell her, you know, 'I don't want you to be with anybody'?\" the man purported to be Sterling said in that recording, according to RadarOnline. On Sunday, Sterling told CNN that in the recording \"I spoke to a girl that I was fond of.\" Stiviano told ABC News earlier this month that the recorded conversation was similar to many she's had with Sterling about race. \"There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one,\" she said. \"Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know.\" Sterling told CNN he's not sure who released the recording. \"I don't know. An 80-year-old man is kind of foolish, and I'm kind of foolish. I thought she liked me and really cared for me,\" he said. \"I guess being 51 years older than her, I was deluding myself. ... I just wish I could ask her why, and if she was just setting me up.\" Sterling says he's spoken with Magic Johnson . Referring to Johnson, Sterling purportedly said on the recording: \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.\" As criticism over the recording spread, Johnson was among the first to say that Sterling should be forced to sell the team. \"He shouldn't own a team any more. And he should stand up and say, 'I don't want to own a team any more,' \" Johnson said in an ABC pregame show interview last month. Sterling told CNN he's spoken twice with Johnson. \"Did you apologize to him?\" Cooper asked. \"If I said anything wrong, I'm sorry,\" Sterling said. \"He's a good person. I mean, what am I going to say? Has he done everything he can do to help minorities? I don't think so. But I'll say it, he's great. But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles.\" Will owners force sale? The matter of the team's sale is with the NBA's Advisory/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday in a conference call. Members discussed the \"termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,\" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. NBA's strategy to force a sale hinges on 1981 document . If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. However, an attorney for Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, told CNN Friday that she wants to keep her 50% stake in the team. \"She wants to remain a passive owner,\" said attorney Pierce O'Donnell. \"She's not going to want to manage the team. She's going to want a very skilled, professional, well-heeled new owner to come in and replace Donald,\" O'Donnell said. \"She only wants to own the team in her lifetime. She's 79 years old. At this point, she's earned it. She's been an owner for 33 years, and she's an avid fan.\" In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Shelly Sterling said she was prepared to fight any attempt by the NBA to take away her stake in the team. \"I will fight that decision,\" she told ABC's Barbara Walters. \"To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?\" NBA spokesman Mark Bass said in a statement after the ABC interview aired that what happens if the owners vote for a forced sale is already spelled out in the NBA Constitution. \"Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well. It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here,\" he said. \"These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.\" Sterling vs. the NBA: Who has the edge?

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he has given the country's security forces the permission to use 'all measures' to find three teenagers who authorities say were kidnapped in a Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The three teens have not been seen or heard from since Thursday evening or Friday morning, and an Islamic extremist group called Dawlat al-Islam has reportedly taken credit for the abductions. '(They were) kidnapped by a terror organization, there is no doubt about that,' Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address Saturday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Demands: Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu says it is the responsibility of the Palestinian government to find three Israeli teens kidnapped by terror group . Netanyahu went on to say that 'it is the responsibility' of the Palestinian Authority to help find the young men. The prime minister says that he has asked Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 'to do everything to help bring them back in peace.' The organization, linked to ISIS, distributed pamphlets about the kidnappings in Hebron, Haaretz reported. Israel security services are investigating the claims. ISIS are the group of bloody-thirsty jihadists behind this week's Iraq insurgency. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for the missing teenagers, who are also feared kidnapped by Palestinian militants. Men pose with automatic rifles and a stationary machine gun, with the ISIS flag propped up behind them. An extremist group linked to the jihadists has claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings of three teens in Israel . Israeli soldiers deploy near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for three missing teenagers from nearby settlements, one of them a U.S. citizen, amid fears Palestinian militants abducted them, authorities said . Authorities . offered little detail, with local media only reporting the hitchhiking . teenagers left their Yeshiva, or religious seminary, on Thursday night . and had not been seen since. Soldiers near Hebron combed the rocky hills . of the West Bank searching for them on Friday. The disappearances come after the formation of a Palestinian unity government following . the collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks. Two Israeli defense officials said authorities believed the teens likely were kidnapped by Palestinian militants, without elaborating. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to brief journalists. 'The main mission is to ensure their return,' said Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, a military spokesman. Tsuri Tsuf, a spokesman for a settlement where one of the teens is from, told Israel's Channel 10 television that his community was 'greatly worried' and gathered to pray for the safety of the youths. Authorities found a burned-out car during their search that investigators were examining. Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency initially imposed a gag order on Friday morning blocking local media from reporting on the incident. Later, an official familiar with the investigation said that one of the teens was an American and that Israeli authorities notified U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to publicly brief journalists. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the U.S. Department of State. The three teens are from settlements in the West Bank, territory Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and that Palestinians are demanding as part of their future state along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. A burnt car which is reportedly connected to the disappearance of three teenagers is taken away near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday . If Palestinians abducted the teens, it would be the first serious incident to challenge relations with Israel since the formation of a Palestinian unity government earlier this month, led by President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party and backed by the Islamic militant group Hamas. The West and Israel consider Hamas a terror group because of its deadly attacks targeting civilians. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas to talk about the missing teenagers and likely will call Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as well, a senior State Department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Netanyahu told the teens' families that Israel is 'making every effort' to find them, his office said in a statement. He earlier said the Palestinian Authority is responsible for the teens' safety. Adnan Demeiri, spokesman of the Palestinian security services, dismissed Netanyahu's claims, saying the teens' disappearance happened in an area under Israeli security protection. Hamas frequently calls for the abduction of Israelis and militants have kidnapped Israelis in the past.

But first ... he has to graduate high school in May. Jack Andraka is going to bring his 3-cent screening test for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer to market -- an alternative to a standard $800 test. But Jack, 16, hasn't been to high school much lately and isn't even sure he'll graduate. The two teenagers with Justin Bieber style haircuts wowed the 1,400 people who attended TED2013 this week, fitting the conference's theme: \"The Young. The Wise. The Undiscovered.\" They were among a number of youthful speakers who Time magazine's Ruth Davis Konigsberg called \"some of the biggest showstoppers at the annual event.\" By contrast, some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful. Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon declared that the era of strong economic growth in the United States is over -- as America faces the headwinds of an aging population, debt, inequality and educational weaknesses; he argued that it's hard to foresee innovations that could have the transformative effect electricity, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine had in powering growth in the past century. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, calling for a private sector-funded \"race to the top\" among states, lamented the inability of Washington politicians to develop a national energy strategy. She got laughs when she noted that Congress' approval rating is worse than lice, root canals and Donald Trump (although better than that of gonorrhea and meth labs). TED.com: Granholm's clean energy proposal . And Lawrence Lessig, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, sketched an even starker picture of political dysfunction, a \"pathological, democracy-destroying corruption\" in which a tiny minority of Americans representing powerful interests use their campaign donations to determine which candidates survive the primaries. Even against long odds, Lessig said the problem is fixable if enough Americans organize to bring about change. There were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat. Jane Chen spoke about developing a lower-tech method to save the lives of premature and low birthweight babies in regions where access to incubators isn't readily available. Her social enterprise Embrace distributes a specially engineered and heated sleeping bag that provides babies the heat they can't generate on their own until they're developed enough to survive. Google CEO Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass, a smartphone-like piece of headgear that enables access to your contacts, your e-mail, your searches and your photos. His pitch for the device -- now being tested by a select few for $1,500 apiece and due on the market later this year -- is partly that it frees people up from the \"nervous habit\" of constantly checking their smartphone as they walk: \"Is this what you're meant to do with your body?\" TED.com: Amanda Palmer -- the art of asking . David Lang, talked of his Open ROV project, which markets an $800 kit -- using off-the-shelf parts -- for a remotely operated underwater vehicle that gives its makers the ability to explore underwater worlds in James Cameron fashion. PayPal co-founder Elon Musk didn't mention his recent dispute with a New York Times reporter over the battery range of the all-electric Tesla Model S, but made a case for the car's virtues before describing his effort to market solar panels to homeowners and businesses and his SpaceX commercial venture to the heavens. He screened a video of a reusable 12-story-tall rocket launching, hovering and then returning to a launchpad ready for another flight. SpaceX capsule reaches International Space Station . Keller Rinaudo demoed Romo, a $150 iPhone-powered robot that recently launched. It uses the brains of the phone's computer chip, its camera and a plastic chassis with tank-style treads to zip around a room, express emotions, interact with owners, kids and pets, and function as \"Skype on wheels\" for grandparents dropping in for a virtual visit. Edith Widder, part of the three-person team that developed the device that lured a giant squid to an underwater camera, explained how it was able to get the first-ever video displaying the enormous size and intricacy of the animal in the deep ocean. 13-year old invents system to protect family livestock from lions . Ron Finley, an activist in South Central Los Angeles, is leading an effort to counter the neighborhood's \"food desert,\" by growing fruits and vegetables on city owned and private land. \"If kids grow kale, they'll eat kale,\" he said. \"If kids grow tomatoes, they'll eat tomatoes.\" Renowned photographer Sebasti\u00c3\u00a3o Salgado showed finely etched works from his forthcoming book \"Genesis,\" a 50-pound, $3,000 behemoth (there's a less elegant and smaller version for under $70) that does justice to the detail of his exquisitely composed black and white photos shot around the world. TED.com: Sugata Mitra -- build a school in the cloud . Stewart Brand, the 78-year-old technologist who came to fame as editor of \"The Whole Earth Catalog,\" introduced an ambitious plan to recreate extinct species, using DNA from museum specimens. The effort, echoing \"Jurassic Park\", won't bring back dinosaurs -- their DNA didn't survive the tens of millions of years since they disappeared -- but aims to \"de-extinct\" such species as the passenger pigeon, declared extinct in 1914. TED normally attracts an audience of the elite of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and venture capital, along with foundation and corporate CEOs, who pay $7,500 for the five-day event, which is moving next year from Long Beach to Vancouver. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers). TED stands for \"technology, entertainment and design,\" although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago. The ingenuity of this year's youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas. Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno. He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14. In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies. Rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine, Wilson's new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt. His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground. He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors. Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said. Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite. Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said. And most exciting to the young space geek, such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination, he said. Andraka, who's 16 and a high school sophomore, won the top prize in the Intel Science Fair competition for his cancer screening test, which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers, providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure. He told CNN in an interview that he doesn't go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projects -- including inventing an MRI the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $10 million Tricorder X Prize to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health. Andraka and Wilson probably don't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED. Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices. By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue. \"Thirty is not the new twenty,\" she said, urging people to \"claim your adulthood\" and start making choices. Spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, a 36-year-old whose new video \"To This Day\" has attracted 5.5 million views, offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve, many still carry a heavy burden. He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself. He spoke of kids being called names, making them feel like \"oddities juggling depression and loneliness\" and challenged them: . \"if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there's something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit\""}]}

Scroll down for video . Angel in training: Kaia Gerber, 13, posted an image of herself sporting a pair of feathered wings on Instagram . Seeing double: The teenager is the spitting image of her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford (L) 'Better than a VS Angel,' one Instagram user commented, while another added: 'The soon to be Victoria's Secret Angel.' Kaia, who is the daughter of Cindy and her husband of 16 years Rande Gerber, made her fashion big fashion debut aged 10, when she appeared in the first ever Young Versace ad. The similarities in appearance between the youngster and her supermodel mother, now 48, quickly caught the attention of the industry's elite, many of whom were quick to label the youngster as one to watch for the future. At the time however, former Vogue cover star Cindy insisted her daughter would have to wait a while before throwing herself into a full-time fashion career. 'At this point, she\u2019s too young to pursue a career,' she told The Daily Front Row. 'There aren\u2019t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But if she\u2019s 17 and wants to try it... of course, what can I say? She\u2019s really into singing and acting.

'She kind of jokingly said - I\u2019m not even sure if it was jokingly - \"I might model first because you don\u2019t have to know how to do anything, but then I want to be a baby nurse.\"' But it seems that Cindy has since changed her mind - and is now happily encouraging her daughter's burgeoning career as a professional model. Earlier this month, the teen made her magazine debut on the cover of Teen Vogue, a move which Cindy admits she was 100 per cent in favor of. 'I\u2019m happy for her to be happy,' she told the UK's Evening Standard. 'She\u2019s kind of chomping at the bit and the Teen Vogue piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do.

Can Democrats break serve, or will the presidential race go to a tiebreaker in November? Here are five things to watch for at the Democratic National Convention: . 1. New man on the big stage -- Most Americans have never heard of the mayor of San Antonio. They will after Tuesday night when Julian Castro becomes the first Latino to give the keynote address at a Democratic convention. Past keynote speakers such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made it to the White House. Maybe that's raising too many expectations for Castro, but his speech will be looked upon the same way. 2. 2016 contenders -- Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan gave blockbuster speeches at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's keynote address didn't go over as well. All three could make bids for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 if Mitt Romney doesn't win in November. So which Democrats are waiting in the wings? Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Brian Schweitzer of Montana and John Hickenlooper of Colorado all have an opportunity in Charlotte. 3. Turncoats -- Is Charlie Crist the Artur Davis of this convention? Davis, the former Democratic congressman from Alabama who seconded Obama's nomination four years ago, had a high-profile speech at the Republican convention. Now it's Crist's turn. What will the former Republican governor of Florida, who could possibly run for his old office as a Democrat, say when he gets in front of the podium in Charlotte? 4. What will Bill Clinton say? -- There's probably more anticipation, and questions, around the former president's Wednesday prime-time address. Once former adversaries when Hillary Clinton was running against Obama, Bill Clinton has become one of Obama's strongest advocates. But the big question is what will Clinton say when he nominates Obama for re-election Wednesday? Obama campaign officials said they haven't seen Clinton's speech yet, but they said they are \"not worried\" about what he'll say. 5. The ticket -- The traditional role of running mate is to be the attack dog. Will Vice President Joe Biden slam Romney as much as Ryan attacked Obama? And how much of what the president will say in his acceptance speech is a defense of his first term and how much is an outline of what he wants to do over the next four years?"}]}

Mike Dawson, who is competing in the men's kayak class, will not just be trying to impress his father, who coaches him, or his brother and sister, who will be watching from the crowd. He will also need to ensure he doesn't incur the disapproval of his mother, Kay, who is one of the judges at the event. The idea of a mother officiating in a competition in which her son is participating may strike some as a little unfair, but the Dawsons and the New Zealand Canoe Federation are eager to stress there's no scope for special treatment in this case. \"The only real advantage mum can give me is her presence at what will be my biggest race ever,\" said Mike Dawson, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time after finishing 16th in the canoe slalom world championships in Slovakia last year. The event involves the kayakers flinging themselves down a steep course of white-water rapids, weaving through a series of gates like slalom skiers in a race against the clock. If the competitors touch or miss a gate, they suffer a time penalty. Each gate has a judge watching out for errors, and a chief official oversees the entire course. As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side. Competitors' runs are reviewed on video, and the chief official has the final say. \"I can't envisage any way a single gate judge could influence the outcome for any athlete,\" said Maree Burnett, the secretary general of the New Zealand Canoe Federation. \"Kay is a very experienced international judge.\" The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees. In the past few years, Kay Dawson has officiated at canoe slalom world championships and world cups in which her 25-year-old son has raced. The ICF has \"a strong officiating process in place to ensure accuracy and fairness at all its competitions, whether it is at world cups, world championships or at the Olympic Games,\" said Lerina Bright, a spokeswoman for the federation. She noted that some judges at the event have the same nationality as some competitors. \"That could equally be thought to create a conflict of interest,\" she said. \"However, the judging process is thorough and stringent and does not provide any possibility for a single individual to affect the outcome of a competitor's run.\" Despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event, the role of individual judges is still significant, Kay Dawson has said. \"When officiating the athlete and 100% accuracy is always the focus, one poor call can mean the difference between a top-10 finish and chance of a medal or being out of the competition,\" she wrote in an article on the New Zealand federation's website in February. Relationships with family and friends don't enter the equation, though, she says. \"I've been officiating for a number of years now and know a lot of the athletes, so it is easy to put aside any personal emotions when I'm on the course,\" Kay Dawson said in comments relayed by the ICF on Wednesday. \"Several of the top men's slalom paddlers have stayed with us in New Zealand while they've been training with Mike and I owe it to all of them to do the most professional job possible,\" she added. Mike Dawson, who was born and raised in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand, says the best way for him to stamp out any perceptions of favoritism is to not make any mistakes. \"If I'm paddling well, the gate judges won't come into play at all,\" he said. He is not the only New Zealander competing in the canoe slalom: Luuka Jones, also from Tauranga, became the first New Zealand woman to compete in the kayak competition in the Olympics after qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Games. London will be her second Olympics, at the age of just 23. For Mike Dawson, the Games are full of new experiences. \"We've been in the Olympic Village for a few days and it's pretty cool,\" Mike Dawson said. \"I can see how people get intimidated, but really it's just like a hotel with an epic food court.\""}]}

Nigel Farage has vowed to resign as party leader if UKIP fails to achieve a general election breakthrough next year. The UKIP leader said there was \u2018not one ounce of complacency from me\u2019 after he was selected last night to stand in the South Thanet seat for UKIP at next year's general election. His nomination was overshadowed by Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to throw his hat into the ring to be the next MP for Uxbridge in west London. But Mr Farage said he confident that the Tories would lose votes to UKIP at the next election. He said: \u2018I'm not pretending for one moment that it's going to be easy, but Ukip is offering something different and distinctive. \u2018If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.\u2019 Mr Farage meanwhile told The Telegraph that Mr Johnson will be a \u2018problem\u2019 for the Tories after the next election. He said: \u2018He [Boris] will be a problem for the Conservatives. He will appeal to the Tory grassroots, and have that little certain something that Mr Cameron appears to be struggling with.\u2019 Mr Farage added: \u2018While Boris on a good day sounds fairly Eurosceptic, and says that we must do this, that, and the other, the reality is that this is the same Boris who advocated an amnesty for all of the illegal immigrants in London a Boris who on a tour of India last year said EU membership was vital to the British economy. \u2018So yes, Boris Johnson is engaging, people like him, but in policy terms, certainly at the moment, he\u2019s a long way from the position that our voters are really looking for.\u2019 He said: \u2018Ukip will be a force in the House of Commons next year and if we get this right we may find ourselves in a hung parliament holding the balance of power.\u2019 Leaked polling suggested that UKIP will target seats on the east and south coast of England held by Tory MPs, including three government ministers. The revelation reignited fears among the Conservatives that a strong UKIP performance could split right-wing voters and help Ed Miliband into power. However, speaking after his selection, Mr Farage said that his party will target Labour too: \u2018Somebody once said I was David Cameron's worst nightmare.

Mr Farage\u2019s comments come as polls showed more voters welcome the return of Mr Johnson to Parliament than the prospect of UKIP winning seats next year. A survey by YouGov has found 57 per cent of the public believes the London mayor\u2019s decision to return to Parliament is \u2018good thing\u2019. Two thirds also believe it is likely that he will one day lead the Conservative party.

In districts including Sham Shui Po, Yau Tsim Mong, and Kowloon City, families, elderly people and the unemployed are crammed into living quarters that are barely bigger than a toilet cubicle in some cases.

Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the \"growing threat\" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it \"must be matched and translated into action\" to have any effect. \"Resolutions alone will not be enough, promises on paper cannot keep us safe, lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack,\" Obama said. If governments abide by the resolution and fully cooperate with one another, the world should become safer, the President said. But it won't be easy, especially given the potential of terrorism to spread beyond the Middle East: Obama noted U.S. intelligence estimates over 15,000 individuals from more than 80 nations have gone to fight in Syria, exacerbating the conflict there and raising the possibility they could \"come home\" and carry out deadly attacks. \"If there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that could not be met by one nation alone it is this: terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence,\" Obama said. The resolution passed Wednesday requires nations to \"suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting, equipping\" and financing of \"foreign terrorist fighters,\" according to Obama. It also also calls on government to \"help build the capacity of the states on the front lines of the fight.\" But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said. \"Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth: that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women and children, the majority of whom are Muslim,\" the President said, using his administration's favored term for ISIS. Obama also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability, including in Syria, where he called for \"a political solution\" to the years-long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups. \"We must work to address ... the oppression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence,\" he said.

After Obama's roughly 10-minute remarks, other world leaders echoed his anti-terrorism views, from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's blasting of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram's \"despicable campaign against humanity\" to South Korean President Park Geun-hye calling them the \"scourge of mankind.\" \"Terrorism is nothing new. It's been with us for years,\" French President Francois Hollande said at the Security Council meeting. \"But it has taken on another dimension, and it wants to conquer territory now.\" There are no \"easy answers or quick fixes\" to addressing the terror threat in the Middle East, Africa and beyond, British Prime Minister David Cameron said. But something must be done, he added -- and for it to work, the world's governments must be on the same page. \"We need a response that involves every part of government and society, and every country involved in the widest possible international coalition,\" Cameron said. The fact countries like Britain and France are backing the United States is hardly surprising. But, as Obama said, what made Wednesday's vote notable is that \"it is very rare where the United Nations achieves the kind of consensus that we see represented in this resolution.\" In fact, officials from China and Russia -- two (of the five) Security Council permanent members who often stymy U.S. efforts at the United Nations, including those related to the Middle East -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on Wednesday. In their words, though, there were hints of possible diplomatic obstacles down the road. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for instance, warned \"against any attempt to narrow down the problem\" to select groups, urging the world not to have \"double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorist and bad terrorists.\"  He also said any efforts must \"address longstanding conflicts\" like those between Palestinians and Israel. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned about \"terrorist organizations and extremist ideologies ... competing with us for future generations,\" calling this \"a battle bearing on the future of the world.\" The world must act, he agreed, but only with the United Nations' stamp of approval. Wang didn't give examples, though the United States and several Arab allies recently launched military strikes against ISIS targets in Syria -- without the U.N.'s or Syria's explicit approval. \"The United Nations and the Security Council have to play the leading role in the global war on terrorism,\" the Chinese minister said. \"This is the only way to maintain unity, achieve effective coordination and take assertive action.\" Obama: U.S. leading, but can't do it alone . Before leading the Security Council meeting, Obama made a more far-reaching appeal earlier Wednesday for world cooperation against terror, climate change, Ebola and a host of other issues, saying the world stands at a crossroads \"between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope.\" Many of the world's problems, the President said, stem from \"the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world.\" The United States is taking a leading role in addressing many of these issues. \"I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done,\" he said. \"We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come.\" But, Obama said, America cannot do it alone. The leaders of the nations gathered Wednesday must decide whether they \"will be able to renew the purpose of the U.N.'s founding, and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism.\" Obama outlined the U.S. government's plan for tackling ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, including airstrikes, training and equipping forces battling the group, and working to cut off its financing and flow of recruits. But, as he's said many times before, American ground troops won't be part of the fight. \"Already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. Today, I ask the world to join in this effort,\" the President said. Those who have joined ISIS \"should leave the battlefield while they can.\" How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . Touches on Ebola, Ukraine, other topics . While terrorism dominated Wednesday's conversation, it wasn't the only topic that Obama addressed in his General Assembly speech. Among them: . Ukraine: Russia's involvement in Ukraine represents \"a vision of the world in which might makes right -- a world in which one nation's borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed,\" Obama said, referring to efforts to recover the remains of victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, shot down over Ukraine in July. If Russia rolls back its involvement, the United States \"will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges,\" Obama said. Ebola: While the United States is sending medical workers and the military to build treatment centers in Africa, the President called for a \"broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders.\" Iran's nuclear program: Obama urged Iranian leaders to work with the United States and others to resolve Western concerns over the country's nuclear program. \"We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful,\" he said. Global poverty: \"We will do our part -- to help people feed themselves; power their economies; and care for their sick,\"  he said. \"If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity.\" Climate change:  The United States will work on the issue within its own borders, but \"we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power,\" Obama said. \"That's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren.\" Syria: Even as it provides even more support -- including militarily -- to moderate opposition forces battling President Bashar al-Assad's government, Obama said that \"the only lasting solution to Syria's civil war is political: an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity or creed.\" Kerry: Fight against ISIS goes on ."}]}

John Allen, the former leader of coalition forces in Afghanistan who was nominated to become supreme allied commander of NATO, is retiring instead of continuing to pursue the post, President Barack Obama announced Tuesday. Allen informed Obama that he will leave the service rather than move forward with the nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, a White House statement said. \"I met with General John Allen and accepted his request to retire from the military so that he can address health issues within his family,\" Obama said. In a statement later Tuesday, Allen said his reasons for retiring were personal. \"While I won't go into the details, my primary concern is for the health of my wife, who has sacrificed so much for so long. For more than 35 years, my beloved Kathy has devotedly stood beside me and enabled me to serve my country. \"It is profoundly sobering to consider how much of that time I have spent away from her and our two precious daughters. It is now my turn to stand beside them, to be there for them when they need me most,\" he said. Allen, a Marine Corps general, was the top coalition commander in Afghanistan for nearly two years. He relinquished that command earlier this month after planning the end of the mission's combat operations. However, Allen was caught up in a scandal over embarrassing e-mails with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley that came to the public's attention during the same investigation that brought down former CIA Director David Petraeus. CNN previously reported that Defense Department officials said there was inappropriate language in those e-mails, but no evidence of an affair between Allen and Kelley. Allen's nomination for the NATO commander post was put on hold while the Pentagon's inspector general looked into the issue. He was cleared of wrongdoing after several months and the White House initially indicated Obama would proceed with the nomination. On Tuesday, Obama called the general one of America's finest military leaders. Allen \"presided over the significant growth in the size and capability of Afghan National Security Forces, the further degradation of al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and the ongoing transition to Afghan security responsibility across the country,\" Obama said in the statement. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement on Tuesday that Allen's leadership in Afghanistan \"will be long remembered as pivotal\" to the mission. \"The strategy he developed and implemented has put us on the right path towards completing this mission, with Afghan forces now on track to step into the lead for security nationwide this spring and to assume full security responsibility by the end of next year,\" Panetta said. Panetta, who also is stepping down, previously acknowledged that Allen has \"been under a tremendous amount of pressure,\" and advised him to take his time in deciding whether to continue pursuing the NATO commander position. In July 2011, Allen succeeded Petraeus to inherit the largest-ever NATO force in Afghanistan and spent 19 months directing his forces against Taliban insurgents and preparing for the first phases of a hand-over of provincial security to local and national forces. About 150,000 ISAF members were deployed at that time, including just under 100,000 U.S. troops. There are 66,000 U.S. service members currently deployed to the region, and Obama announced last week his intention to bring home 34,000 of them within a year. Less than a month after he assumed command, the United States suffered its deadliest single attack of the Afghan war when insurgents downed a CH-47 Chinook helicopter in Wardak province, killing 30 U.S. service members. The toll included 22 Navy SEALs. Allen later faced additional diplomatic crises that followed controversial incidents that included the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. service members, U.S. airstrikes that resulted in civilian deaths and the killing of 16 civilians in a massacre allegedly carried out by a U.S. service member. An uptick in \"green-on-blue\" attacks -- in which Afghan forces or trainees turn their weapons against U.S. counterparts -- is also believed to have hampered the training of Afghan forces and contributed to increased public discontent at home over American deployment to the region. A graduate of Georgetown University and the National War College, Allen also drew distinction for his counterinsurgency work in Iraq, particularly in the country's volatile Anbar province in 2008, where he helped isolate a growing insurgency. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report."}]}

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded Wednesday that it's 'possible' convicted felons could become Obamacare 'navigators,' gaining access to tax information and Social Security numbers of Americans as they help them register for insurance coverage. Her admission came during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, in a tense exchange with Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn. 'Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check,' Cornyn asked her, 'even though they will receive personal \u2013 sensitive personal information from they individuals they help sign up for the Affordable Care Act?' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded that criminals could be helping Americans fill out health insurance applications, gaining access to the tax information required to determine their eligibility for government subsidies . Round Two: Sebelius faced an unexpectedly harsh grilling at the hands of Senators. Last week, she got a similarly hostile welcome in front of congressmen . 'That is true,' Sebelius responded in a moment of nervousness. 'States could add an additional \u2013 um \u2013 background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement.' 'So a convicted felon could be a navigator,' an annoyed Cornyn followed up, 'and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them?' 'Uh, that is possible,' she said, shifting blame to the groups responsible for deploying navigators in the field. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Four Pinocchios' Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on President Obama's now-debunked promise that Americans who like their health care plans would be able to keep them after Obamacare went into effect -- a promise that The Washington Post called a 'whopper' Line of fire: Sebelius faced calls to resign over the shambles by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts . 'We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators, and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job.' Sebelius also mentioned 'a self-attestation' that navigators are expected to sign, confirming their identities and their intentions. 'But it is possible.' President Obama is headed to Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, where he will promote the navigator program, a feature of Obamacare that allows paid assistants, many from community organizing groups cast in Obama's historical mold, to help Americans with their enrollment. Despite the administration promoting the navigators as an alternative means of registration to the program's semi-functional website, they too must use the website to determine whether or not applicants are eligible for federal government subsidies. March to the gallows: Sebelius faced unusually tough questions from a typically more sedate Senate Finance Committee panel, with one member calling for her resignation . Under questioning from Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sebelius tried to qualify her startling admission about information security under Obamacare. 'The navigators must go through a minimum of 20 hours of training,' she said. 'A significant portion focuses on privacy and security issues.' She insisted that applying for insurance under the new law 'there is no personal health information ever collected or needed, so they don't have access to that.' But Isakson countered that 'to estimate the subsidy somebody's going to get under the Obamacare law, you'd have to know their income on their tax return.' 'Are the navigators going to be able to use that information in order to make that estimate?' 'If a consumer chooses \u2013 yes \u2013 to share that information,' she replied, 'they can give the consumer the information about what they qualify for.' Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Sebelius' home state of Kansas, called for her resignation over the botched Obamacare website rollout."}]}

A bride has spoken of her delight after she was walked down the aisle by her long-lost father - just weeks after meeting him for the first time since she was a baby. Donna Molyneux, 34, had not seen her father Bill Sneddon since he and her mother Linda split-up when she was a baby in 1979. Incredibly, despite not knowing what Bill looked like it, it took her just 10 minutes to track him down on Facebook after recognising her own likeness in one of his profile pictures. Donna Molyneux sought out her long-lost father Bill Sneddon to give her away on her wedding day . Donna had not seen since Bill (pictured left age 33) since she was a baby (pictured right) in 1979 . Donna's dream came true as her father Bill Sneddon walked her down the aisle, having just recovered from an operation to remove a tumour . After making contact with him on the internet they agreed to meet for a reconciliation last July. Heart-breakingly, just days after meeting for the first time, Bill was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was forced to undergo surgery to remove tumour. Battling the illness, Bill managed to recover enough to be strong enough to fulfil his daughter's dream and walk her down the aisle at her wedding. Donna, who has four children, daughter Charlie, 17, and sons Jordan, 15, Corey, nine and two-year-old Bobby, was married to Rueben, 38, in Solihull, West Mids., on August 24 last year. She and her family now regularly meet up with Bill when he travels 150 miles from his flat in Spalding, Lincs., to their home in Birmingham. Donna got married to Rueben, 38, in Solihull, West Midlands, on August 24 last year . Donna said: 'It\u2019s a miracle I finally found my father and I\u2019m delighted his first \u2018fatherly\u2019 duty was to walk me down the aisle and give me away. 'My mum got pregnant with me after a fling with my dad. They met in a social club and one thing led to another. 'He only met me once when I was a baby but I\u2019m told my family told him they would raise me so he left. 'I was raised knowing my dad was out there somewhere but had no idea what his name was other than Bill. Donna with her mother Linda Whittaker (left) and with her new step sister Kathleen Sneddon (right) 'When I got engaged to Rueben I decided to try and find my dad. I just wanted to know what he was like even if he rejected me. 'My mum had only ever told me his name was Bill, I think she wanted to protect me from getting hurt, but one day she told me his surname. 'The first thing I did was put his name into Facebook and loads of Bill Sneddon\u2019s came up but there was one profile picture which I recognised - it looked just like me. 'I contacted him and asked if he had ever known my mum and he replied and from there we met and discovered we were father and daughter.

Millions of people across Europe, Australia and Canada are watching the best of the BBC for as little as \u00a352 a year, or \u00a34.33 a month. An annual pass for thousands of hours of drama, comedy and documentaries is available for just \u00a352, compared to the \u00a3145.50 licence fee paid by Britons at home. For as little as \u00a34 a month people overseas can access BBC iPlayer online while UK residents are forced to pay \u00a3145 for a licence fee whether they watch the channel or not . And overseas users get access to a vast vault of priceless BBC archive material unavailable to British viewers. The disparity last night led to calls for the broadcaster to use the money to reduce the licence fee. Tory MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said the profits should be used to save domestic viewers money. He added: \u2018I am very much in favour of the BBC commercialising content and using the revenue to create more innovative, good quality British-made productions. But it is an outrage that\u00a0 they are selling content to\u00a0 foreign nationals at a cheaper rate than to those in the UK who are obliged to pay the licence fee. \u2018The licence fee is a poll tax. People in Britain, if they have a TV, have no choice, whether they watch the BBC or not.\u2019 The BBC is quietly expanding the availability of the internet-based Global iPlayer \u2013 which is not available in the UK \u2013 after launching a \u2018pilot\u2019 more than two years ago. It can be accessed across Western Europe, as well as in Australia and Canada. European subscribers pay \u20ac7.99 a month (\u00a36.70) or \u20ac74.99 euros a year (\u00a363), which works out at \u00a35.25 a month. In Australia the annual cost is even cheaper at 89.99 Australian dollars (\u00a352.50) while in Canada access costs just 84.99 (\u00a352) Canadian dollars \u2013 \u00a34.33 a month. The BBC is quietly expanding the availability of the internet-based Global iPlayer \u00bf which is not available in the UK \u00bf after launching a \u00bfpilot\u00bf more than two years ago. For this, viewers can access 2,000 hours of shows on demand via their iPad or iPhone. The Global iPlayer also offers the back catalogues of landmark comedies such as Blackadder and Fawlty Towers. One Canadian viewer wrote: \u2018At last decent programming! Canadian Dollars 85 for a year is NOTHING for what you get to see or listen to.\u2019 Foreign viewers are not offered live streamed content, radio or an identical catch-up service to that which is available in Britain. But the vast majority of\u00a0 BBC radio programmes can be accessed through the internet anywhere in the world. Last year, BBC Worldwide, which is behind the move, revealed the iPlayer has already been downloaded over a million times overseas. The Global iPlayer is only available through the iTunes \u2018app store\u2019 which means, as with all other services, 30 per cent of all revenue is handed to US tech giant Apple. Just last month the BBC revealed a record number of domestic households are watching programmes online, fuelling fears they are legally dodging the licence fee. It is thought many viewers who use the iPlayer service do not own televisions, meaning they are not required to pay the licence fee. A TV licence is required for viewing programmes online only when broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live, as in the case of events such as Wimbledon. A BBC spokesman said; \u2018Unlike the UK BBC iPlayer, the Global iPlayer is not a seven-day catch-up service, and it does not offer the same breadth or amount of content available to the UK licence fee payer. Profits generated by BBC Worldwide are returned to the BBC for the ultimate benefit of the licence fee payer.\u2019"}]}

What he did was absolutely private and it was put out in public. He was so honest about it. I took it all on board, accepted it and he deserves another chance to do what he does so well. 'The ongoing investigation, we have spoken to The FA, I don't there is anything in the pipeline. I don't think there is anything really to investigate but that is in the contract, we have to protect the football club. Malky has been warned, he has been open about it all. 'He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that fully and totally. So I just want to get on with the great game.'

Spurs should have had a half-time lead but Roberto Soldado spurned a glorious chance when through on goal and that was the turning point as Mario Gomez and Mohamed Salah struck for Fiorentina to send Mauricio Pochettino's side out. Spurs now have to quickly turn their attention to Sunday, to prepare for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Host commentator . Thanks for joining me for the action in Florence this evening. Spurs will certainly need to re-group ahead of facing Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday . Heartache for Spurs, they are out! Fiorentina have won and are through to the Europa League last 16. 22-year-old Salah has done his parent club Chelsea a real favour tonight. The winger, on loan in Florence, has been exceptional. I wonder if Blues boss Jose Mourinho has been watching... Tottenham keep losing possession as the lump the ball forward. It's all very desperate now. Fiorentina's side are a wall of purple as Tottenham continue to fail at breaking their stubborn resistance. Andros Townsend whips in a freekick and Soldado's looping header just cruves over the bar. Here is the picture Spurs fans won't want to see- Salah doubling Fiorentina's lead. Eriksen lets fire from long range but Neto makes a smart save to concede a corner . Joaquin heads off for club legend Pasqual as the hosts try to run down the clock . The Florence side are already time wasting by holding up the ball in the Tottenham corner as Spurs struggle to obtain possession. Time is running out. It's all Spurs at the moment but the attacking play is very disjointed. Harry Kane has the ball in the back of the net but Soldado is offside before his cutback. Tottenham still require two goals. Andros Townsend wins a freekick just on the edge of the area but Eriksen once again hits the wall. Vertonghen trudges off to be replaced by Walker . Salah is booked for his exuberant celebration having ripped off his top during his sprint to the crowd . Spurs shoot themselves in the foot. An innocuous ball isn't dealt with by Tottenham and a one-two between Salah and Gomez puts the Egyptian through on goal. He finishes past Lloris and leaps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate. Spurs on the brink? It's that man again - Badelj is free 20 yards out but Fiorentina waste another decent chance after his blazes well over the bar. Micah Richards has put in a fine performance for the Serie A side. Here's some of his latest acrobatics! Here we go, here come the cavalry. Harry Kane and Andros Townsend come on for Spurs. Chadli and Bentaleb make way. Salah weaves his way through the Spurs defence and finds himself in front of Lloris but his weak shot is hit straight at the French stopper. Unbelievable chance to double the lead. Time for a change? Spurs are getting increasingly frustrated as Bentaleb attempts an audacious cross field pass which goes out for a Fiorentina goalkick! Gonzalo Rodriguez on, Basanta off after the defender pulls up whilst making a clearance. Mario Gomez runs clear after a horror moment from Fazio. The centre back gives the ball away to Badelj, who plays in the former Bayern Munich striker to sprint through and slot past Lloris. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is becoming increasingly animated on the touchline, especially after a few decisions have gone against his side . Badelj is in the thick of the action. Salah steals the ball in the Spurs penalty area and cuts it back for Badelj but his effort from the middle of the box is straight at Lloris . Ben Davies is booked for a robust tackle on Badelj. Slightly harsh as seemed 50/50. Chadli bursts down the left wing but his cross is too close to Neto. Massive 45 mins for Spurs who begin the second-half. So whilst free-scoring Harry Kane is on the bench and Soldado has spurned a glorious chance, Pochettino's other striker Emmanuel Adebayor has posted on Instagram a picture of him kicking back drinking from a coconut. A sustained period of pressure from Spurs sees multiple crosses into the Fiorentina box. Nobody can latch onto a cross and it stays 0-0 at the break. That gives gives Spurs 45 minutes to find a desperately needed away goal to progress. A ball over the top sees Salah race through once again but his effort his flashed well over the Tottenham bar. Here is the moment Soldado should have scored for Spurs. Ouch! Mario Gomez out of nothing is clear by the Tottenham touchline, he cuts back inside but his shot is well blocked by Fazio. It ricochets off Fazio's arm but a penalty would have been extremely harsh. Free-kick for Spurs....and specialist Eriksen smacks it into the wall. Disappointing for the visitors but it's all hands to the pump for Fiorentina as the pressure continues to build on their goal. Since Soldado's shocker Tottenham have been well on top. It seems the hosts are giving Spurs far too much respect and Pochettino's side are struggling to break down two banks of defence. Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai, who is at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, sums it up well... Soldado is played straight through on goal as the Fiorentina back-line is far too high. Soldado is joined clear with Chadli but the Spaniard's tame pass fails to find Chadli and Neto is able to intercept and gather the ball. That's a crucial waste from Soldado, but how costly will it prove? So far so good for Spurs. They've managed to get into the game and keep Salah relatively quiet. However Pochettino doesn't seem too thrilled on the touchline... Former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani enters the fray as Fernandez picks up a muscle injury . Almost immediately after Chiriches swings in a delightful ball from wide right which Savic has to clear with a last-ditch header. Very promising spell for Spurs. Spurs win a corner and from the clearance Stambouli unleashes from 20 yards but his effort is well blocked by Joaquin. Nacer Chadli loses possession wide on the left and a swift counter attack started by Micah Richard sees Mario Gomez in on goal but he fails to find his feet and Ben Davies just about manages to cover the danger and force a goal kick. The Italians are rapid on the break. Spurs really need to close down Salah. The winger finds volumes of space on the edge of Tottenham's area and is narrowly called back for offside. Spurs were in trouble there . Well well, Spurs have a penalty shout! Stefan Savic (a former Manchester City defender) goes to ground and brings down Eriksen in the box. Minimal if any contact with thew ball but referee\u00a0H\u00fcseyin G\u00f6\u00e7ek waves away some weak appeals. Former Roma forward Erik Lamela volleys at goal from outside the box but it's comfortably saved by Murara Neto . Salah is already imposing himself on the game with his pace. Running down the left he wins a corner for the hosts but Lloris does well to punch clear . As I mentioned, talisman striker Harry Kane is on the bench for Spurs tonight. The Serie A side have the first chance. Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah does well on the left to set up\u00a0Badelj but his 20 year strike goes wide of Lloris' post. Their is a raucous atmosphere at the\u00a0Stadio Artemio Franchi and both sides have begun tentatively. Focus will be needed tonight. Kick-off has started another historic European night for Tottenham... A strong Spurs line-up is out on the pitch. Just a reminder Pochettino's side must score after Fiorentina's away goal at White Hart Lane last week. The Tottenham squad has been out on the\u00a0Stadio Artemio Franchi pitch for a quick warm up. They'll play in front of 2,200 Spurs fans who have sold out their allocation. Harry Kane is supposedly rested for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. But will Spurs need him later to rescue their European dream? Fiorentina substitutes: Rodriguez, Aquilani, Pasqual, Lezzerini, Babacar, Tomovic, Ilicic . Tottenham substitutes: Walker, Rose, Paulinho, Vorm, Townsend, Kane, Mason . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino appears in high spirits ahead of kick-off . Here are the line-ups out in Italy. The big news is Harry Kane starts on the bench for Spurs. Fiorentina (4-3-3): Murara Neto; Richards, Basanta, Savic, Alonso;\u00a0 Fernandez, Pizarro, Badelj; Joaquin, Gomez, Salah . Tottenham (4-4-1-1): Lloris; Chiriches, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Stambouli; Bentaleb,\u00a0 Lamela, Chadli; Eriksen; Soldado .

At the same time, Britons are consuming more calories than ever \u2013 proof the Government\u2019s obesity strategy is failing, the report concludes. The average household calorie consumption has risen by 12 per cent since 2006. Sugar rose by 11 per cent and fat by 12 per cent. One in four adults is considered dangerously overweight, and for children the figure is one in five. The Government\u2019s flagship strategy hinges on arrangements with food and drinks firms to voluntarily cut levels of sugar and fat. But this Responsibility Deal policy, introduced in 2011, has been likened to \u2018putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank\u2019 by charities, while doctors argue obesity can only be properly tackled if firms are forced by law to make products healthier. The investigation by the BMJ found the scientist overseeing the strategy, Professor Susan Jebb, received \u00a3194,652 for a clinical trial by Coca-Cola between 2008 and 2010.

In total, she has been given \u00a31.37million towards her research since 2004 from firms including Nestle cereals, Sainsbury\u2019s and Unilever, whose brands include Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Magnum and Walls ice cream. Professor Jebb was appointed the Government\u2019s adviser on obesity in 2011 by former health secretary Andrew Lansley, who also disbanded the existing group of experts who had been very critical of the Responsibility Deal.

Dr Aseem Malhotra, a consultant cardiologist and director of campaign group Action On Sugar, said: \u2018The public would be appalled to learn that scientists advising them how much sugar to consume have financial ties to the sugar industry. The responsibility deal has been a complete failure.\u2019 Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: \u2018It is legislation, not cosy deals, which we need to tackle this crisis.\u2019 But other scientists insisted the food industry did not influence their research nor advice, even if it paid for it.

O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said. The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said. The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec. The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship. Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said. The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation \u00bb . Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help. In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator. \"You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough,\" Adams said. \"Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy.\" Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt. \"As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it,\" he said at about 3:40 a.m. The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but \"lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston\" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was \"basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents,\" Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time. \"We are in hell,\" one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power. On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast. Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday. Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads. In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith. \"Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't,\" Smith said. Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers. About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein. Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman. Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said."}]}

Albergotti and O'Connell, who are both Wall Street Journal reporters, claim that Armstrong wasn't fussed if Crow saw what was going on, explaining it was something all cyclists did, according to The New York Daily News, which published an excerpt of the book today. 'He trusted that Crow would have no desire to tell the press or anyone else about the team's doping program.' The couple, who were briefly engaged, were just dating at the time. But Crow didn't spill the beans about the overseas trip until five years after their relationship ended in 2006.

The latest account claims Crow informed on Armstrong after Food and Drug Administration criminal investigator Jeff Novitzky gave her a proffer agreement, protecting her from criminal prosecution if she told the truth. A representative for Crow did not offer a comment to the Daily News. Blood transfusions boost athletes' endurance by increasing the number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in their bodies. These were just one of the many tools Armstrong used as well as banned substances to propell him to the top of his sport. 'Wheelmen,' due out next Tuesday, also discusses what Armstrong's other friends and supporters knew of his drug taking."}]}

Inconsistencies with the shadows of Haruna Yukawa, fellow captive Kenji Goto and the masked killer known as Jihadi John suggest images of the hostages were recorded separately and then added together for greater effect. Other tell-tale signs include the jumpsuits worn by the two men - they are slightly different shades of orange and don't flutter in the wind at the same time. Scroll down for video . Shadows on the hostages (circled) lie in inconsistent directions, suggesting they may have been filmed in two separate locations with different light sources and the footage then combined . ISIS is well known for its video and imaging production abilities with all propaganda videos it releases having been carefully manufactured and edited. Mr Goto and fellow Japanese national Haruma Yukawa appeared in the video, released earlier this week, in which they were threatened with death unless $200million was paid within 72 hours. In the video, Mr Yukawa and Mr Goto sit kneeling on either side of Jihadi John. But the shadows of the militant, Mr Goto and Mr Yukawa lean in different directions. And perhaps most tellingly, the shadows of the hostages' heads are cast down onto opposite sides of their necks. Both examples indicate there may have been different light sources used for filming the men separately, then adding them together for a more intimidating video. Tsuyoshi Moriyama, an associate professor at Tokyo Polytechnic University and image technology expert, said: 'It's possible that video images taken at different times were combined. 'A very high level of knowledge and skill would be necessary to make such a composite video,' the Washington Post reported, according to\u00a0Stuff. Shiego Mori-shima, a Waseda University Professor on information-communication engineering, added it was possible that the images were recorded in different places after noting the jumpsuits were different shades of orange and didn't flutter in the wind at the same time. Meanwhile, the mother of Mr Goto has pleaded for his life as the deadline to pay his ransom passed overnight and militants warned the 'countdown has begun'. An ISIS posting appeared online today showing a clock counting down to zero along with gruesome images of other hostages who have been beheaded by ISIS. Mr Goto's mother Junko Ishido choked back tears while telling a packed news conference that her son was not an enemy of the people of Islamic faith and if she could, she would offer her own life to ensure his safe release. Junko Ishido wipes away tears as she pleads for her son's life, as the deadline to pay for his release passed . The Japanese government said it was in an 'extremely severe . situation' while\u00a0Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said saving the men's lives is . paramount but that Japan will not bow to terrorism. The Japanese government considered the deadline to be 5:50am today. 'My son Kenji is not an enemy of the people of the Islamic . faith. I can only pray as a mother for his release,' Mrs Ishido said. 'If I could offer my life I would plead that my son . be released, it would be a small sacrifice on my part. 'He only went to rescue his friend. He has always looked out . for weaker people, he was always helping weaker children than . him,' she added. She said she was astonished to learn from her daughter-in-law that she had a newborn baby, and said the child needed his father. Abe has ordered his government to make every effort to . secure their safe release, setting off a flurry of activity . among Japanese diplomats. The captor in the video, which resembles those showing . previous Islamic State captives who were beheaded, says the ransom demand matches the $200 million in aid that Abe pledged to help countries . fighting Islamist militants. Abe made the pledge during a multi-nation visit to the . Middle East earlier this week. Islamic State militants have . seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, and beheaded several . Western captives.

Asked if Tokyo would pay the ransom, he said: 'There is no . change to our stance that we will not give in to terrorism and . will contribute to the international response to terrorism. As . we make utmost efforts for their swift release, we are . negotiating through all available channels.'

Prior to the video's release, Japanese diplomats had told . the families of the two captives that the government would not . pay ransom, sources familiar with the matter said. Tokyo's most prominent mosque, the Tokyo Camii and Turkish . Culture Center, posted a statement calling for the prompt . release of the hostages. It said ISIS's actions are 'totally against Islam . and have a serious impact on Muslim communities all over the . world and put Muslims in a precarious position'.

Prayers have been offered at Tokyo's largest mosque as the status of the men remains unclear. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga was asked about the militants' claim that the 'countdown' had begun and said Japan was analysing it. 'The situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two Japanese hostages,' Mr Suga said. He added Japan is using every channel it can find, including local tribal chiefs, to try to reach the captors."}]}

James Watson won the 1962 Nobel prize for discovering the structure of DNA. Watson has apologized for the controversial remarks. He failed to appear to a book signing at a London bookshop Friday afternoon, and organizers of his planned Sunday evening talk at Newcastle's Center for Life said they had been informed Watson would not appear because he was already on a flight home to the States. The board of trustees at New York's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which Watson has led for nearly four decades, said they had suspended his administrative responsibilities pending a review of his comments. Watson, 79, an American who won the 1962 Nobel prize for his role in discovering the double-helix structure of DNA, apologized Thursday for his remarks -- but not before London's Science Museum canceled his talk there, planned for Friday evening. The museum said Watson's words had \"gone beyond the point of acceptable debate.\" The controvery began with an October 14 interview Watson gave to the Sunday Times, which quoted him saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really.\" Watson also asserted there was no reason to believe different races separated by geography should have evolved identically, and he said that while he hoped everyone was equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\" The biologist apologized \"unreservedly\" Thursday for his comments and said he was \"mortified\" by the words attributed to him. \"I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said,\" Watson said during an appearance at the Royal Society in London. \"I can certainly understand why people, reading those words, have reacted in the ways that they have.\" \"To all those who have drawn the inference from my words that Africa, as a continent, is somehow genetically inferior, I can only apologize unreservedly. That is not what I meant. More importantly from my point of view, there is no scientific basis for such a belief.\" Watson was expected to sign copies of his new book, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, at Blackwell bookshop in central London Friday afternoon but failed to appear. Soon afterward, a spokeswoman for the Center for Life in Newcastle, where Watson was expected to speak Sunday night, said they had been told Watson was canceling all speaking engagements and was already flying home. Center spokeswoman Julia Hankin said they were disappointed. \"We welcomed the opportunity to discuss his controversial comments,\" Hankin said. \"We had hoped for a rigorous and lively debate.\" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the institute on New York's Long Island which Watson has headed since 1968, confirmed it had suspended his responsibilities as chancellor \"pending further deliberation by the board.\" It said the board publicly disagreed with the comments attributed to Watson in the Sunday Times. Late Thursday, The 1990 Trust, a British civil rights group, called for a boycott of Watson's books and pressure to be put on venues to cancel his planned appearances. Watson's remarks to the Sunday Times were but the latest controversial comments from the eminent biologist. In 1997, Britain's Sunday Telegraph quoted Watson as saying that if a gene for homosexuality were isolated, women who find that their unborn child has the gene should be allowed to have an abortion. During a lecture tour in 2000, he suggested there might be links between skin color and sexual prowess and between a person's weight and their level of ambition. And in a British TV documentary that aired in 2003, Watson suggested that stupidity was a genetic disease that should be treated. E-mail to a friend .

The woman pictured here is not his accuser . The New York Police Department seized 'biological\u00a0evidence' and a sex toy from the penthouse apartment of Rev Al Sharpton's lawyer Monday as they investigate rape allegations against the 70-year-old civil rights attorney. Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed a seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his\u00a0limousine\u00a0to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. He has not been charged with a crime. However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.' He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime. NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post. Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. One source told the newspaper: 'The guy\u2019s hung like a cashew.' Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. It\u2019s all about sex with this guy.' Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims. Search and seizure: Detectives carried away several bags of evidence from Rubenstein's penthouse apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side . Rubenstein lives in the $7million penthouse apartment at the top of this East 63rd Street highrise on the Upper East Side . He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. \u2018There\u2019s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,\u2019 White told New York Daily News. \u2018We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.\u2018 . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the\u00a0New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement \u00a0sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain\u2019t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million. High-profile case: Rev. Herbert Daughtry, far left, Rev. Al Sharpton, second from left, and attorney Sanford Rubenstein, far right, escort Esaw Garner, second from right, the wife of fatal police chokehold victim Eric Garner, after a press conference August \u00a021, 2014 . Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday. Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations. 'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'"}]}

Amir Khan out-shone the neon glare of the fabled Las Vegas Strip on Saturday night. So brilliantly did he bedazzle the much-respected three-time world champion Devon Alexander that this neon city which craves thrills and excitement is clamouring to see his name back in lights here soon. VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan: Hype about my chin is b******* . Amir Khan (left) throws a punch on his way to victory against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday . Khan never looked in trouble and kept Alexander on the back foot with a punches in bunches . Khan celebrated at the final bell but Alexander knew he was a beaten man after the 12 rounds . The billion dollar question is whether the next time his fresh face appears on those giant electronic screens it will be alongside the glowering features of Floyd Mayweather. There was no dissenting, not even by the most chauvinistic Americans, that the statement Khan delivered, as promised, was powerful enough to merit a mega-fight with the pound-for-pound king of the ring next year. Even without the exclamation mark of a knock-out. Khan\u2019s up-and-down journey from a silver medal in Athens to a performance in Vegas as golden as those preposterous shorts he wore in the MGM Grand Garden has burnished a new crown jewel in British boxing. The time has come for the nation to unite behind his utterly valid claim for a shot at ultimate glory. Britain has been radically divided in its feelings about this warrior for Anglo-Islamic relations. For those who have doubted or resented him, now is the moment to relent. Amir Khan, in the week of his 28th birthday, has grown into a cause for patriotic celebration. He has catapulted himself into the elite company of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the summit of the most talent-packed division in boxing. To be a welterweight at this point in fistic history is to be confronted by a veritable host of world-class fighters, if they will meet your challenge. That has to be put to Mayweather if he retracts this weekend\u2019s promise to give Pacquiao and the world the mega-fight after which they have been hungering for years. If he is not the first alternate for Mayweather\u2019s next fight, then Khan must assume that his performance damaged his own chances as drastically as it hurt Alexander\u2019s fighting pride. Khan lands a left hand square on Alexander's chin on his way to a dominant performance . Khan's speed was once again his biggest asset as he left the former world champion dazed and confused . Alexander lands a rare shot on Khan during a fight he struggled to show his attacking prowess . Khan and Alexander go head to head early in the fight but only one man would go on to take control . Mayweather reneged on a promise made a year ago to engage with Khan, whose legendary promoter Oscar De La Hoya said: \u2018Now I can understand why Floyd doesn\u2019t want to fight Amir. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to fight him after watching this.\u2019 In unison with the other 7,767 in the arena, De La Hoya was on his feet not only cheering Khan but standing to applaud a virtuoso with his talents in full artistic flow. The speed has always been phenomenal. Now the ring-craft has been perfected by long hours in the gym with his latest trainer, Virgil Hunter. The balance \u2013 not only of feet and movement but in understanding when to attack without unnecessary risk \u2013 has been drilled into the completion of the gladiator package. De La Hoya said: \u2018Not only did he win virtually every round against a highly technical southpaw boxer \u2013 which is very complicated to achieve \u2013 but he showed why he would be big trouble for Floyd.\u2019 For the record I gave Alexander only a sympathetic share of the eighth round, his best and in which he managed to land three or four solid left hooks. That was the one occasion Khan wavered from the game plan devised by Hunter, who said: \u2018 He was great and he corrected that mistake almost at once but it marks him down to 9.9 out of ten for briefly losing focus.\u2019 Alexander was berated in his corner but the truth was he had no solution to the puzzle posed by Khan . Khan lands a right hand on Alexander (left) and celebrates with promoter Oscar de la Hoya (right) Time and time again, Khan was first with the jab as he opened up a healthy lead over Alexander . Khan showed a new-found patience as he timed his shots to perfection to bewilder Alexander . Khan pictured at the post fight press conference after his emphatic win over Alexander in Las Vegas . DAVID HAYE: As predicted, an amazing, disciplined and punch perfect performance by Amir Khan against a world class fighter. CARL FROCH: Really easy win for Khan, not many expected such a one sided whooping! Well done kid. RIO FERDINAND: Well done @AmirKingKhan on a polished mature schooling of Alexander! Whos next???? MICHAEL OWEN: Great win for @AmirKingKhan earlier this morning. Top class, let's hope he goes on to unify the division. The three official judgements varied narrowly either side of my 120-109 score-card. Alexander was beaten beyond a quibble, saying: \u2018I couldn\u2019t get my punches off. I couldn\u2019t land on him. I couldn\u2019t do all the things we had worked on in training camp. He is very fast.\u2019 So quick that when he really accelerated into lightning combinations from all angles the punches were a blur in the eyes of those at ringside. Alexander did not detect them at all until they thundered against each side of his head. All that prevented a stoppage was Alexander\u2019s courageous willingness to keep taking those blows \u2013 and the embarrassment to himself that came with them. Alexander was previously a two-weight world champion but Khan made him look ordinary in Las Vegas . Khan lands a right hand on the button as the Brit showed why he is one of the best in the world . Khan celebrates his victory which earned him the WBC Silver welterweight title (right) Fundamental to Hunter\u2019s blueprint was the left hook off Khan\u2019s jab, over Alexander\u2019s right lead. Such was the precision as well as speed of Khan\u2019s punching that those hooks landed with what must have been sickening monotony. There were Khan converts all around the Grand Garden. They believed when he said: \u2018I\u2019m getting better as I get older. And wiser. And my best years are still ahead of me'. Suddenly, those of us who have been saying for some time that he has real chance of inflicting Mayweather\u2019s first defeat found allies in abundance. Whisper it, please, in case Mr Money is eves-dropping. If Mayweather was watching, as he said he would, he will have had plenty of food for thought as he went off to his favourite burger bar on the Strip. King Khan is on his way to greatness. All aboard the roller-coaster \u2013 even the naysayers who have been reluctant to forgive him being stopped by Danny Garcia \u2013 \u2018I\u2019d love to avenge that defeat if I get the chance\u2019 - and who still want to see Kell Brook knock him out, if that fight happens in Britain. Love him or not,the tickets are worth every dime. Because with this young man it is a ride with never a dull moment."}]}

Reeves had been held in the Pasco County jail without bond since he shot and killed 43-year-old Navy veteran Chad Oulson after a confrontation over Oulson's text messaging inside a movie theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. An appeals court ruled Thursday that \"the record suggests no special circumstances or other factors that would justify a reasoned discretionary decision to deny pretrial release.\" On Friday, Judge Pat Siracusa -- who wrote in his ruling that the court was \"hesitant to announce in open court...the specific enumeration of reasons to deny bond,\"  -- adopted the appeals court ruling. Siracusa's bond conditions stipulate that the 71-year-old Reeves is allowed to leave his home only to attend church, court dates, medical appointments, and to go to the grocery store.  The former police officer must also \"surrender all firearms in his home to either the Pasco Sheriff's Office or to his lawyer, Richard Escobar,\" according to the order. Escobar said Reeves is \"a wonderful family man\" and \"a church-going man\" who is \"coming home to resume his life and help prepare his defense.\" A spokesman for Oulson's wife said the news was a \"difficult pill to swallow.\" \"He ripped her family apart and now he can be home, be in his own bed, and see his children and grandchildren,\" said T.J. Grimaldi, Nicole Oulson's attorney. \"It is unbelievably unfair.\" Heated argument escalated . The hearing in February that resulted in Reeves initially being denied bond served almost as a mini-trial. Over 12 hours of  testimony was heard over two days from witnesses who had also gone to see \"Lone Survivor\" that day. One patron, Charles Cummings, testified he overheard Reeves and Oulson talking, and at one point, the latter said, \"I'm just texting my 2-year-old daughter.\" Soon after that, a \"very agitated\" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later. At that point, a fairly calm Oulson asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughter's babysitter, according to Mark Douglas Turner, a retired Air Force veteran. The situation devolved after more words were exchanged. Alan Hamilton, an off-duty Sumter County Sheriff's corporal, said he heard Oulson say, \"I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind.\" Popcorn flew in Reeves' direction soon after. \"And almost immediately,\" recalled Turner, who said Oulson threw the bag, \"the gun comes out and there are shots fired.\" Escobar said Friday that Reeves \"used the law of self-defense to preserve his life just like every citizen has the right to do,\" and described Oulson's conduct in the theater as violent. But Grimaldi warned Friday that with Reeves back on the street, it could happen again. \"Reeves is an absolute danger to society,\" said Grimaldi.  \"He went from throwing popcorn in someone's face to murdering someone.  This could happen to someone else.\" Witness describes shooting ."}]}

The website should have known Mr. Salim was a danger to women after numerous complaints were made to both local police \u2013 who notified the site of the danger he posed \u2013 and directly to the site by abused women, according to the suit. \u2018Craigslist was on notice and knew or should have known defendant Ali Salim was inherently dangerous to its Internet users,\u2019 the suit said. Multiple women answering ads placed by the former doctor accused him of sexual assault, and even to be alone with him in the house while he painted the human digestive system on their abdomens, according to the suit. The accused killer\u2019s employer, Knox Community Hospital, is also being held liable in Ms. Ballman\u2019s death. The suit accuses the hospital of negligence for allegedly allowing Mr. Salim to take the needles he is said to have used to inject the deceased mother with heroin, as well as not keeping adequate track of the narcotics being taken. Not a cleaning ad: Authorities have now said that Ms. Ballman answered a personal ad posted on Craigslist, not a cleaning ad as was originally reported . Loving mother: Ms. Ballman is pictured here with one of her children . Accused killer: Dr. Ali Salim pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, kidnapping, rape and assault . The suit also tried to accuse a third party of helping Mr. Salim inject Ms. Ballman with heroin, but authorities have not been able to prove that accusation. Discovered dead August 1, 2012 on the side of a road in rural Ohio, Ms. Ballman is said to have been alive when Mr. Salim allegedly dumped her body after injecting her in the leg with heroin and raping her. Mr. Salim has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, rape and assault charges, as well as two counts of murder \u2013 one each for Ms. Ballman and for her unborn daughter she planned to name Mabel Lilly. Ms. Ballman was nine months pregnant when she died. Horrific: Ms. Ballman's 19-year-old brother was petitioning to take custody of her children - until he was shot dead earlier this year . So sad: Ms. Ballman left behind two young children . Originally reported to have been responding to a housecleaning ad on Craigslist, authorities now say Ms. Ballman was replying to a personal ad on the site. Mr. Salim\u2019s lawyer has accused the deceased mother of prostituting herself to support her drug habit. Authorities have disputed this claim, saying there is no evidence to suggest Ms. Ballman was a drug user. The deceased mother also had two other young children that her 19-year-old brother James Ballman was peititioning for custody of until he was shot dead in February."}]}

Police cordoned off the area around the Krudttoenden Cafe while they investigated what was thought to be a suspicious letter left only steps away from the banks of flowers left as a memorial. After the letter was checked out by military bomb disposal units, police declared the all-clear. But the sight of barricades, sniffer dogs and bomb disposal officers will have done little to ease the city's frayed nerves. The latest developments . News that the suspected gunman swore fidelity to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a posting made on what's apparently his Facebook page just before the shooting spree began Saturday will also disturb many. The post pledges \"allegiance to Abu Bakr in full obedience in the good and bad things. And I won't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief.\" A Facebook friend of the shooter told CNN he believed the page, which has since been deleted, matched the profile of his friend. The suspect in the attack has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a senior member of the Danish government said. The gunman opened fire at a free-speech forum at the cafe before shooting several people outside a synagogue, and then firing at police. Police killed him in the shootout. While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark. Authorities said he was \"well-known by the police for several criminal incidents,\" including weapons violations and violence. Police also said he was \"known in connection to gangs.\" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, PET, also confirmed Tuesday that it received a report from the Danish prison service last year warning that the suspect was at risk of radicalization. However, based on that report, PET \"did not have reason to believe that the now deceased 22-year-old was planning an attack,\" the statement said. Anti-Semitism in Europe: Will it cause Jews to leave? The report was made as part of a system set up to ensure that authorities can take preventive measures if prison inmates are identified as being in danger of being radicalized. Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday. Lawyer Michael Eriksen said the men, 19 and 22, were charged with two counts of accessory to murder and five counts of accessory to attempted murder. Eriksen told CNN that the two, who pleaded not guilty, have not been charged under Denmark's anti-terrorism laws. The nation began the healing process Monday night with a candlelight vigil at which Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt appealed for national unity. Authorities estimated more than 40,000 attended the event. \"An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone,\" she said. \"The Jewish community is an important part of Denmark. We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know. We stand together as Danes.\" Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who attended Saturday's forum, says he thinks he was probably the target of the attack. He escaped unharmed and told CNN on Monday he has gone into hiding. Vilks, known for his controversial depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, is on an al Qaeda hit list. He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid. By the end of the melee at the cafe, the gunman had wounded three officers and killed a 55-year-old man. The Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard. The second victim was a man providing security for a bat mitzvah party taking place behind a Copenhagen synagogue. The Jewish Society of Denmark identified the deceased as Dan Uzan, 37. He is due to be laid to rest Thursday at the Mosaiske Vestre Jewish cemetery, the society said. The funeral will be open to all.

The change took effect on Thursday night - two weeks after the Ukrainian tragedy - and will add up to 10 minutes to the seven-hour-long London to Dubai flight, which is scheduled for four times a day. It is understood that instead of flying over Iraq, planes will take a path further east over Iran. Qantas stopped flights over Iraqi airspace on Thursday in the wake of the MH17 disaster on July 17 . The new route is expected to add up to 10 minutes to the seven-hour-long flight . A Qantas spokesman said the airline has closely monitored flight paths over conflict zones since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago. The tragedy claimed the lives of all 298 people on board, including 38 Australians. He said Qantas flights from London to Dubai travel over Iraq at an altitude of 38,000 feet and 41,000 feet, well above the minimum altitude for commercial flights over Iraq. But the US Federal Aviation Administration had just increased the minimum altitude from 20,000 feet to 30,000 feet, prompting a review of Qantas' London-Dubai route. It is understood that instead of travelling over Iraqi, airspace planes will be travelling over Iranian airspace . The Iraqi conflict zone has been marred with attacks from militants of the Islamic State - an off-shoot of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda . 'Qantas has closely monitored the issue of flight paths over conflict zones, particularly in light of the MH17 tragedy, with safety our first priority,' the Qantas spokesman said. 'We have no new information that alters our safety assessment of flying over Iraq, especially given the altitudes we maintain over this region. 'However given the various restrictions imposed by different governments in the past 24 hours, including by the United States FAA, Qantas has temporarily rerouted its flights within the Middle East to avoid Iraqi airspace. This change will apply until further information becomes available.' The airlines' decision comes after alliance partner Emirates announced its plans to stop flying above the area 10 days after the attack, Daily Mail Australia reported on Monday.

Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region. Spain's Prime Minister blamed the attack on the Basque separatist group ETA, although there was no warning call before the explosion, as often happens in ETA attacks. The car exploded at 9:05 a.m. (3:05 a.m. ET) in an open-air parking lot in the Basque town of Arrigorriaga and damaged five other cars. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, and police moved in to investigate. The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez. \"ETA showed us the road to pain,\" Lopez said on national TV. \"We will show them the road to prison.\" The officer was a senior figure in the fight against ETA and the explosion was caused by a limpet bomb placed underneath the car, officials told CNN partner station CNN+. A limpet bomb is one that is stuck to the underside of vehicle. Arrigorriaga is about 30 miles south of the largest Basque city of Bilbao. ETA's last fatal victim was a businessman who was shot dead in the same region last December. \"My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity,\" said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for Basque independence. The European Union and the United States list it as a terrorist group. ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years. He has also vowed to stop the group. There are about 600 ETA members or suspected members in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in both countries have told CNN."}]}

Five other hostages are missing from the In Amenas complex and could be dead, Prime Minister Abdul Malek Sallal said. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Before Sallal's statement, officials from other countries and companies that employed foreign workers at the sprawling plant had confirmed 29 hostage deaths. Seven of the 37 confirmed dead haven't been identified yet, according to the prime minister. Those who have been identified include seven Japanese, six Filipinos, three Americans, three Britons and one Algerian, officials from those countries said. Some 29 militants also died, while three were captured, Sallal said, according to the state-run Algerian Press Service. The standoff ended Saturday, after four days, when Algerian special forces stormed the complex for the second time. The government said it did so because the militants were planning to blow up the installation and flee to neighboring Mali with hostages. \"If it exploded, it could have killed and destroyed anything within 5 kilometers or further,\" Sallal said. Read more: Bloody Algeria hostage crisis ends after 'final' assault, officials say . Militant says Mali unrest spurred assault; others say it followed ample planning . The crisis began Wednesday when Islamist extremists in pickup trucks struck the natural gas complex some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Libyan border, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. After taking over, the well-armed militants planted explosives throughout the complex, Sallal said. They came from eight countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Niger, Canada and Mauritania. Algeria's military talked with the militants, but their demands that prisoners in the North African nation be released were deemed unreasonable, according to the prime minister. The country's special forces waged the assaults to free the hostages and were backed by the Algerian Air Force. Read more: Nations scramble to account for missing after Algeria hostage crisis . At one point, the militants tried to flee the compound in vehicles that carried explosives and three or four hostages as human shields, Sallal said. At least two of the vehicles flipped and exploded during the attempt, he said. Sallal said the terrorists had entered the country from northern Mali, where Malian and French authorities are battling Islamist rebels. One-eyed veteran Islamist fighter Moktar Belmoktar has claimed responsibility for the hostage-taking on behalf of his al Qaeda-linked group, according to Mauritania's Sahara Media news agency. Belmokhtar -- who was among 12 defendants, five like him still on the run, who were the subject of an Algerian court hearing Monday related to their terrorist involvement -- said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months. Algerian minister says gas plant will restart, foreign workers will return . The targeted gas facility is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Some 790 people worked there, including 134 foreign workers, Algeria's prime minister said. Read more: Algerian forces seek 'peaceful' settlement of dramatic, deadly hostage crisis . British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday the effort to evacuate workers is complete and that U.K. officials are now focused on bringing the bodies of slain British hostages back home. Cameron praised Algerian forces for their work in ending the crisis, despite concerns from some nations earlier that the Algerians had unnecessarily put hostages at greater risk. \"This would have been a most-demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it,\" the British leader said. \"The responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists.\" Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa, including recent violence in Mali and Somalia. Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there. That interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe. Energy and Mining Minister Youcef Yousfi, who a day earlier insisted Algeria can keep its gas facilities secure without foreign forces' help, said he believes the targeted gas facility will be back running \"in the shortest possible time\" and that foreign workers will soon return. Several foreign companies, including Statoil and BP, evacuated their workers from Algeria after the incident. \"I don't think that these workers have left definitively Algeria,\" Yousfi told reporters, according to the Algerian Press Service. \"Maybe some left ... to reassure their families, but I want to ensure that no company or no worker permanently left the country.\" Nations mourn dead, try to account for others . Here is a breakdown on the status of hostages from around the world who were involved in the crisis: . Colombia . Colombia's president said one of its citizens is presumed dead. France . No known French hostages are unaccounted for, the defense ministry said. A man identified as Yann Desjeux died after telling French newspaper Sud Ouest  that he and 34 other hostages were treated well. It was unclear what led to his death. Japan . Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Minoru Kiuchi and officials from JGC, a Yokohama-based engineering firm, saw and identified the bodies of seven Japanese citizens killed in the crisis, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga announced late Monday. Three Japanese remain unaccounted for, according to Suga. Malaysia . Three hostages were on their way back home, state media reported. There is a \"worrying possibility\" that another is dead while a fifth is unaccounted for, the agency said. Read more: Algeria attack may have link to Libya camps . Norway . Five Norwegians are missing, while eight are safe,  according to Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Philippines . Six Filipinos are confirmed dead and four are missing, the nation's foreign affairs ministry said.  In addition, 16 Filipinos are alive and accounted for, according to a ministry spokesman. Romania . One Romanian lost his life while four others were freed, the country's foreign ministry said. United Kingdom . Three British citizens were killed, the Foreign Office said Sunday. Three other British nationals and a UK resident are also \"believed dead,\" according to British officials. The Foreign Office confirmed the name of one slain hostage, Garry Barlow, in a statement Monday. \"Garry was a loving, devoted family man, he loved life and lived it to the full. He was very much loved by myself, his sons, mother and sister and the rest of his family and friends and will be greatly missed,\" the Foreign Office quoted his wife, Lorraine, as saying. Twenty-two other Britons who were taken hostage have safely returned home. United States . U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland on Monday said three Americans had been killed and identified them as Victor Lynn Lovelady, Gordon Lee Rowan and Frederick Buttaccio, who had been previously identified. Seven U.S. citizens survived the crisis, added Nuland, who declined to comment further citing privacy considerations. Erin Lovelady described her father Victor, of Nederland, Texas, as a laid-back, understanding and loving man. \"I want people to understand how wonderful my dad was, and how great a dad he was, and how much he's going to be missed by me and my mother and my brother,\" Erin Lovelady told CNN affiliate KFDM, describing herself as \"daddy's little girl.\" Gwen Eckholm called Rowan -- her former neighbor in Mesa, Arizona, who recently moved to eastern Oregon -- a \"very intelligent, super-nice guy\" who told her he felt safe working in Algeria. He said \"we're in a compound in the middle of nowhere, and we've got security, and I'll be fine,\" Eckholm told CNN affiliate KNXV. \"I guess you can't really be secure any place.\" Read more: Algeria attack may have link to Libya camps ."}]}

Scroll down for video . Little angel: Two-year-old Oliver Brown, from Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire, who was born with a large birthmark on his back on the top of his back that looks like a pair of angel's wings . Mixed blessing: The unusual mark runs half way down Oliver's spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades. But it must be checked by doctors at least every three months, his wings may turn lethal . Baby love: Oliver with his mother, Stephanie. His parents have been told he will live a full and healthy life unless the condition spreads to his brain or spine. He also faces an increased risk of aggressive skin cancer . Oliver was at birth diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred. Despite the diagnosis Oliver is likely to live a full and healthy life, but he must be careful: children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer. Because of that, he has to wear a sunsuit and prescription sunscreen to protect him from the sun's UV rays. There is also a risk of the condition spreading to the brain or spine, where the lesions and moles could cripple his nervous system. Mrs Brown, 34, from Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire, told Mason's News Service: '[Oliver] is one of the fortunate ones. Some children are riddled with moles and even get them on their eyelids. 'He actually has his on the top half of his back so it looks like wings. There can be lots of questions because it comes up to the nape of his neck and so is visible. 'As he gets older we would hope he can accept himself for who he is. We have all got these bits of ourselves that we do not like and we have to accept them. 'He is wonderful the way he is and I'm sure in the dark times he will realise this. 'He is lucky in the sense he is such a cutie pop, everyone seems to think so, and I think people will overlook his condition.' New baby: Oliver pictured at birth, when he was first diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred . Marks: The latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases is a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb, said\u00a0Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group . Precious: Babies and children with CMN have regular MRI scans to check the spread of the condition . Oliver attends Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge every three months for a check-up. Doctors examine the moles to see if any are turning cancerous and Oliver is given MRI scans to see if he has developed any tumours on his brain or spine. Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group, said: 'Children with CMN have to be very careful. 'There is an increased risk of cancer so factor 50 sun cream is a must and we now have UV protection clothing which can be used. 'But it's also important to let them have their childhood and the kids still need vitamin D. 'Sometimes the birthmarks can break down and crack so they have to have cream to help them. 'In some cases it turns into CMN syndrome which sees pigmentation on the brain and spine which can cause fits and stop development and can be fatal when tumours develop. 'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain. 'Our latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases and it's caused by a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb. 'This is why it's so important to give babies MRI scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads.' Charity work: Oliver with his seven-year-old brother Josh and other pupils at Fen Drayton Primary School, which is helping to raise money for Caring Matters Now by staging a 10km fun run . Ms Hardwidge said likening children's birthmarks to shapes lets them know they are special. 'When children have interesting shaped birthmarks it's a great way of telling them them about the condition and letting them know they are special,' she said. 'Oliver's mum does it by telling him he has angel wings. 'My own daughter has one on her leg shaped like a paw print and that was a great way of telling her about it.' Oliver's seven year-old brother Josh's school, Fen Drayton Primary, is holding a 10k fun run to raise money for Caring Matters. Oliver was diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - moles or birthmarks which are present at birth and usually oversized.\u00a0CMN stands for: . Though CMN means birthmark or mole at birth, around 1 per cent of CMN appear after birth, usually in the first year of life. The condition affects 1 per cent of people and having it means there is a risk that lesions and moles can also grow on the brain.\u00a0This is called CMN syndrome, which can cause fits and stop development. If tumours develop, it can be fatal. Children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of being diagnosed with malignant melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer.\u00a0As a result, they must wear factor 50 sun cream and wear clothing with UV protection, if possible. 'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain,\u2019 said Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group. Research has shown the majority of CMN cases are caused by a mutated gene.

An eminent British scientist has been jailed for almost five years after being caught smuggling cocaine in a bid to impress a glamour model more than three decades\u00a0 his junior. Professor Paul Frampton, 68, claimed he was duped into carrying the drugs by gangsters who struck up a relationship with him online by pretending to be former Miss Bikini World Denise Milani.

Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured  in a game against Clearwater High School on Friday night. He was rushed to an area hospital, where doctors would discover that the injury had caused a circulation-strangling clot behind his knee that would soon cost him a limb. Freak accident: Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured in a game Friday night, leading to his leg amputation . Tense moments: It was clear from the start that Williams' injury would require immediate treatment Friday, but no one would have guest just how serious as he was wheeled off the field. Here, Williams is seen being wheeled off the field as his teammates looked on Friday . Couldn't feel his toes: Blood clots in the defensive lineman's knee caused blood to stop flowing to Williams' right lower leg . His injury was serious from the start and caused a half-hour delay in the game before Williams was taken off the field in a stretcher. When he arrived at the hospital, he complained he was in pain, but more importantly that he couldn't feel his toes. Doctors spent the weekend attempting to get the blood flowing back into the limb, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The decision to amputate below the right knee was made Sunday. Williams' mother Bonita Copeland said she didn't tell her son about the amputation until the surgery was over and that he continues to come to terms with the loss of his leg. 'It was a freak accident and it could've been something worse,' Copeland said. 'Even though my son lost his leg, I'm happy he's still here.' So what was so freakish that a teenage athlete lost a limb? One expert told the Tampa Bay Times that Williams' injury sounded like 'compartment syndrome.' Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which\u00a0are groupings of muscles, nerves and blood vessels within joints. Broncos safety Rahim Moore nearly lost his leg from such an injury in 2013. However, compartment syndrome is rarely seen in football players. Williams' coach Jeremy Frioud told The Tampa Bay Times on Monday that the surgery was successful. His teammates planned to wear stickers bearing his number '69' at the next game in his honor. Williams mother first believed her son had injured his medial collateral ligament or MCL, which would not have been uncommon for a football player. She said she didn't reveal the amputation to her son until after the surgery. Here, a gurney is seen before it was used to wheel Williams off the field . Though only rarely seen in football players, an injury-induced ailment called 'compartment syndrome' has been known to cause athletes to lose a limb. Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says can be caused by athletic exertion or an impact injury. Broncos safety Rahim Moore underwent emergency surgery in 2013 to staunch bleeding in the muscle sheath in his lower left leg, a condition known as lateral compartment syndrome. Moore's surgery was successful and he's since returned to the field. Some fare better: Broncos safety Rahim Moore (26), here catching an interception against the San Diego Chargers, suffered from a form of compartment syndrome that nearly cost him his leg in 2013 ."}]}

Iran, which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits, laid out confidential proposals in the morning. A spokesman for the European Union's foreign policy chief called the presentation \"very useful.\" The two-day talks in Geneva bring together Iran's representatives with those from the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Talks continued in the afternoon, and will resume on Wednesday. \"For the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions,\" a senior U.S. State Department official said. Ahead of the talks: U.S. hopeful but 'clear-eyed' Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who is taking a lead role in the negotiations, said Tuesday that the \"negotiation's environment was positive,\" according to Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency. Many in the West fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb, but Iran -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is chairwoman for the talks for the P5+1 bloc, while Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is leading the Iranian delegation. Ahead of Tuesday's meeting, Zarif said he hoped that together, Iran and the West would be able to work out a \"road map\" toward a final resolution by Wednesday. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said that the mood was one of \"cautious optimism\" but that the \"ball is in Iran's court\" to respond to the bloc's concerns. The P5+1 bloc put forward its own proposals at a meeting with Iran in Kazakhstan in the spring, and these remain on the table, Mann told reporters earlier. 'Verifiably proven' The talks, which are being conducted in English for the first time, are due to last two days, but the timetable is fluid, Mann said. \"We have said we want Iran to engage constructively with proposals we have put forward. Or, if they want to, they can come up with their own proposals,\" he said. \"What matters is the end result -- that they address the international community's concerns about the purely peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program. \"We have to reach a situation at the end where they have proven, and verifiably proven, that there is no nuclear military program. That is the end result that is being sought.\" The Iranians' PowerPoint presentation, laid out in English, was titled \"Closing Unnecessary Crisis, Opening New Horizons.\" Araqchi said Iran's goal is to guarantee its citizens' rights to \"enjoy nuclear energy, including enrichment, along with the verification of its peaceful program,\" according to the Fararu news agency. Critics have expressed suspicions about Iran's uranium enrichment, fearing that Iran may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb-grade materials. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama and a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Zarif. Iran nuclear talks are key topic as Obama, Netanyahu meet . It was the first such high-level contact between the two sworn enemies since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze. Israel: Don't relax sanctions too early . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the international community not to relax too soon the painful economic sanctions that have put Iran's leaders under \"intense pressure\" to return to talks. \"I think it would be a historic mistake to ease the sanctions when they are so close to achieving their goals,\" he said. \"Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's military nuclear program. \"This opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on Iran, because it is that pressure that has brought Iran back to the negotiations in the first place. And it is that pressure which makes the peaceful dismantling of Iran's military nuclear program possible.\" Iran's president: We're open to nuclear talks, but don't make threats . Israel's Security Cabinet also warned Tuesday against conceding too much too soon to the Iranians. \"Israel does not oppose Iran having peaceful nuclear energy. This does not require uranium enrichment or plutonium. Iran's nukes prog does,\" Netanyahu spokesman Ofir Gendelman said via Twitter. Could Revolutionary Guards sabotage Iran-U.S. thaw? A country that \"regularly deceives the international community\" does not have a \"right to enrich\" as Iran claims, he said. A senior Obama administration official told reporters in Geneva that the administration would be willing to consider quick relief on sanctions \"targeted in proportion\" to what Iran puts on the table, should it be prepared to curtail the pace and scope of its uranium enrichment program, offer steps to improve transparency of its nuclear program, and address concerns about its stockpile of enriched uranium. Larijani: 'We are ready' Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is keen to resolve the issue \"in a short period of time,\" Larijani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Geneva. \"From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,\" he said. Rouhani: Nuclear weapons have no place in Iran's security . \"If the Americans and other countries say that Iran should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that, then we can clearly show and prove that. We have no such intention. So it can be resolved in a very short period of time.\" Nonetheless, Larijani said, the West must accept Iran's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes, as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iran is a signatory. Building trust . Some believe that Iran's recent apparent willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program is a result of the crippling sanctions on its economy. Shortly after this year's U.N. General Assembly ended, a U.S. State Department official said the United States would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on Iran if it took confidence-building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its nuclear program. But this will take time and the building of trust. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is in Geneva, stressed that the entire sanctions regime targeting Iran would not be lifted \"any time soon\" unless the array of concerns about Iran's nuclear program was fully addressed.

Fraud: Benefit cheat Caroline Hartshorn, who claimed benefits, claiming she could barely walk due to arthritis, was working as a children's entertainer . A benefits cheat who claimed she could barely walk due to crippling arthritis was caught working - as a children's entertainer at a holiday park. Greedy Caroline Hartshorn, 38, claimed more than \u00a35,000 of taxpayers' money in disability allowances on the basis she needed full-time personal care. But the married mum-of-two from Skegness, Lincolnshire, was exposed as a fraud after investigators found she working at a holiday park - as well as three other jobs. She worked as a children's entertainer at The Tavern pub at Mablethorpe Chalet Park during the summer of 2011 and spring of 2012. Between April and June 2011 Hartshorn also worked as a caravan sales assistant, a care assistant and a market manageress. Skegness Magistrates Court heard the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) received an anonymous tip off. The court was told she was overpaid \u00a35,140.35 in Disability Living Allowance between December 2010 and August 2012. Hartshorn, from Skegness, admitted two charges of failing to notify change of circumstances when she appeared at court last Wednesday. JP's gave her a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay \u00a3100 in costs. The court heard Hartshorn was born with arthritis and began to claim for her condition in August 1992 with a care element added from 1995. In 2009 Hartshorn filled in a self-assessment form on which said she could only walk ten yards at a time and needed personal care. But in May 2011 an anonymous allegation was made against Hartshorn which led to a six-week surveillance exercise by authorities which found the evidence which contradicted her self-assessment. But Dave Clapham, defending, said . Hartshorn believed she had informed the DWP her condition had improved . following a knee operation. Hartshorn worked as a children's entertainer at Mablethorpe Chalet Park during the summer of 2011 and spring of 2012 . He said: 'She was born with a condition of arthritis in her joints, a knee operation did alleviate some of the problems with that but there was a part where she could do nothing at all. 'Whilst she could perhaps get about a little there wasn't a diminishment in the pain. 'It's not dishonesty from the start, all of this work has been very short term. She should have notified the authorities, in fact she believed she had. 'The businesses she does run are from home.' Hartshorn refused to comment outside court."}]}

The 75 soldiers were identified by name, Australian defense officials said Wednesday. A further 128 bodies were identified as being Australian. \"The number of soldiers that we have been able to identify exceeds even our most optimistic forecasts,\" said Greg Combet, Australia's minister for defense personnel, materiel and science. About 2,300 British and Australian troops were killed in the battle and thousands more were wounded, captured or left missing in action when they were ordered to charge into German machine guns July 19, 1916, in northern France. So many died that night that British and Australians could not recover all their dead. German soldiers buried hundreds of them in mass graves, which were rediscovered in 2008. The battle of Fromelles remains the most fatal 24-hour period in Australian military history, Australian defense officials have said. Combet said officials are unlikely to identify every soldier at Fromelles, though they will try. DNA was key to identifying the soldiers, but historical, anthropological, and artifact evidence was also used, he said. \"I am also pleased to say that we have strong reason to believe that more identification could occur in the future,\" he said. Excavations of the mass grave began in May 2009 and lasted until September. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which builds and maintains cemeteries for Commonwealth troops who died in the two world wars, built a cemetery near the site of the battle where the excavated troops are being reburied. The Pheasant Wood cemetery was the first full cemetery it had constructed in more than 50 years, the commission said. \"All but one of the soldiers have been reburied in individual graves in the purpose-built Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery,\" said Alan Griffin, Australia's minister for veterans affairs. Those whose identities cannot be determined will be marked by a headstone reading \"Known unto God,\" the commission said. The final soldier will be buried at a special ceremony in July to mark the 94th anniversary of the battle, he said. \"The new cemetery is a fitting resting place for these brave men, who made the ultimate sacrifice,\" he added. The Australian Department of Defence released photographs of some of the 75 men whose remains were identified. They include Cpl. Herbert Thomas Bolt of Sydney, Australia, of the 55th Battalion, who peers out from the picture wearing a slouch hat, a wide-brimmed hat pinned up on one side that is a trademark of the Australian Army. Private Henry Alfred Cressy, from New South Wales, of the 54th Battalion, sits for a portrait while wearing his military uniform. Private Clifford Dawson Holliday, also from New South Wales and the 54th Battalion, smiles in his picture while wearing a peaked cap. The men's ages were not immediately known. About 800 people from Britain and Australia who think they may have a relative buried at Fromelles have donated DNA to try to identify the bodies, said Peter Jones, the DNA consultant on the project. But that's only half as many as the experts need, he said, since about 1,600 Commonwealth dead from the battle remain unaccounted for. The Ministry of Defence urged people who believe they have a relative at Fromelles to get in touch. The 250 bodies being buried at Pheasant Wood are among the 1,600. Personal items found with the bodies have also helped experts identify them. In addition to military decorations, uniforms, and buttons, the items include personal effects such as a locket with a lock of hair, and a return ticket to Perth, Australia -- left on the body of a soldier who never lived to use it. A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site. CNN's Richard Greene contributed to this report."}]}

A U.S. sailor stands accused of ringing doorbells in the middle of the night and breaking into a 72-year-old woman's property while drunk, say police in Yokosuka, Japan. Authorities arrested Manuel Silva, 20, early Monday on the elderly woman's property in the city, located south of Tokyo. The arrested sailor is assigned to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, the Navy said. A Navy spokesman said he wasn't allowed to identify the sailor by name. Being off-base without permission could put Silva in breach of a standing curfew for all U.S. military service members in Japan. U.S. officials imposed the curfew in response to widespread outrage over rape accusations in October against U.S. sailors on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The incident started after police received several late night emergency calls. Somebody in the neighborhood where Silva was found was ringing doorbells and running away before the doors were answered. Police say they later discovered Silva on the elderly woman's property. The Navy said it is \"currently reviewing the incident to determine if there was a violation\" of regulations for U.S. service members serving in Japan. Silva was being held at a Yokosuka police station until his scheduled transfer Tuesday to a local prosecutor's office. \"The U.S. Navy takes this incident seriously,\" said USS George Washington spokesman Derrick Ingle. He said the Navy is \"fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation.\" For decades, crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in Japan have contributed to a bumpy relationship between the Japanese people and the U.S. military. In November, a U.S. airman was accused of breaking into a family's home on Okinawa and assaulting a teenage boy before jumping off a third-floor balcony. Relations between the Japanese and the U.S. military also suffered in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island. CNN's Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong contributed to this report."}]}

Total playing numbers in 2014 were recorded at 844,000, down from 908,000 for the previous season. Kevin Pietersen has offered to coach cricket in schools as he bids to boost the sport's popularity . Poor weather this summer was cited as a potential factor in the drop, but the announcement has been met with consternation within the game. Pietersen, whose own participation levels this year fell somewhat following his sacking by England, took to Twitter to have his say. In a series of messages, the country's leading international run scorer wrote of his dismay at the figures and even opened the door to some grassroots work himself. 'Been off Twitter for a while, but couldn't stay off when I heard about today's announcement re drop off in cricket participation over here,' he said. Pietersen plays a shot for Surrey during the Natwest T20 Blast match against Somerset at The Oval . 'We've got a fantastic pool of talent here in UK & thought of kids dropping out & not fulfilling potential is frightening & needs changing. 'Any school cricket coaches or after school clubs doing winter training, tweet me and I'll pick a couple next week to join you...?

'Thanks to an excellent response ECB now has a much clearer picture than ever before of who plays recreational cricket, what type of cricket they prefer to play, when they want to play it, and we are now setting about finding ways in which we can best address their needs going forward.

The declaration by Holder came in a letter to a federal appeal's court that had ordered the government to respond by Thursday in a legal and political spat over the health care law championed by President Barack Obama. The attorney general personally met the deadline with a three-page, single-spaced letter-- following the specific instructions of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing a challenge to the health care law. Holder's letter affirmed the government's stance that federal judges indeed have the authority to decide the fate of the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- and any other law Congress passes. \"The power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute,\" Holder said. Read the letter (PDF) His personal involvement in crafting the response signaled the issue's hot-button importance within the administration four days after Obama made controversial remarks that advised the Supreme Court not to take an \"unprecedented\" step by overturning the health care reform law. Obama and the White House have since attempted to clarify the president's initial comments, which were in response to a reporter's question about the Supreme Court's three days of hearings on the health care law last week. However, Holder's letter made clear that the substance of Obama's remarks were in line with the administration's recognition that the high court has the power of judicial review. \"The President's remarks were fully consistent with the principles described herein,\" concluded Holder's letter. The dispute involving the court and the executive branch has highlighted the political dispute over whether the health care law will survive various legal challenges, including the pending Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of a key provision. The high court's ruling, expected in June, would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals. The outcome of the health care cases in an election year could have a lasting impact on Obama's re-election chances as well as the credibility of the federal courts, which are supposed to be beyond politics. On Monday, Obama said he was \"confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically-elected Congress, and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a dually constituted and passed law.\" Some conservative critics interpreted those remarks as a challenge to judicial authority, suggesting Obama was putting political pressure on the high court. A day after the president's initial remarks, the three Republican-appointed appellate judges held a hearing on a challenge to the health care law from physician-owned hospitals. Judge Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee, was especially tough on a Justice Department lawyer defending the law and specifically mentioned the Obama remarks from the day before. \"I'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect, and I'm sure you've heard about them, that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed 'unelected' judges to strike acts of Congress that have enjoyed -- he was referring to, of course, Obamacare -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of Congress,\" Smith said. \"That has troubled a number of people who have read it as somehow a challenge to the federal courts or to their authority or to the appropriateness of the concept of judicial review,\" Smith continued. \"And that's not a small matter. So I want to be sure that you're telling us that the attorney general and the Department of Justice do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of Congress or portions thereof in appropriate cases.\" Government lawyer Dana Lydia Kaersvang appeared initially taken aback, but replied such authority has existed for centuries. Nevertheless, Smith and Judges Emilio Garza and Leslie Southwick then ordered the Justice Department to submit by noon Thursday Texas time a three-page, single-spaced letter addressing whether the Obama administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power. In a sign of the political nature of the imbroglio, Smith's phrasing in open court of the law as \"Obamacare\" used a term coined by opponents of the law. Holder's letter Thursday offered repeated deference to the power of the federal courts. He said the Justice Department \"has not in this litigation, nor in any other litigation of which I am aware, ever asked this or any other court to reconsider or limit long-established precedent concerning judicial review of the constitutionality of federal legislation.\" Legal analysts say the administration is walking a fine line in trying to tamp down criticism from legal and political circles. \"There are two things going on, of course,\" said Thomas Goldstein, a prominent Washington attorney, law professor, and publisher of SCOTUSBLOG.com. \"First, Holder (in the letter) says that we have an argument courts can't hear this case. Second, if you can hear the case, you certainly have the power to invalidate part of the statute as constitutional. But (he says) you shouldn't do that lightly.\" The last part of Holder's letter \"is how they are framing the president's point -- that the courts need to give the elected branches deference,\" Goldstein added. \"It's a respectful letter, but it has an element of, 'What are you talking about, the president never said that.' \" The specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the health care law restricting doctor-owned hospitals from expanding their facilities. The challenge was brought by an East Texas spine-and-joint hospital, and the case is separate from the cases being considered by the Supreme Court. After his initial remarks Monday proved controversial, Obama sought to clarify them Tuesday. \"The point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress,\" Obama said. \"And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this.\" The imbroglio continued Thursday, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, using a Rotary Club speech in Lexington to tell Obama to \"back off\" and let the courts do their work without political interference. \"The president crossed a dangerous line this week. And anyone who cares about liberty needs to call him out on it,\" McConnell said. \"The independence of the court must be defended. Regardless of how the justices decide this case, they're answerable, above all, to the Constitution they swore to uphold. The fact that this president does not appear to feel similarly constrained to respect their independence doesn't change that one bit. So respectfully, I would suggest the president back off.\" Even Obama's former Harvard Law School professor and mentor, Laurence Tribe, said the president \"obviously misspoke,\" telling the Wall Street Journal that \"I don't think anything was gained by his making these comments and I don't think any harm was done, except by public confusion.\" Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney faced skeptical reporters Thursday just before Holder's letter arrived at the appeals court. Carney said it was \"preposterous\" to suggest Obama does not respect the power of courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation. \"It is kind of ridiculous to believe that the president wasn't talking about the context of the (health care) case, but I completely concede that he did not describe the context when he took the question and answered it on Monday,\" Carney said. Two years ago, Obama attracted similar outcry when he criticized the high court's conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law, giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections. Some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court's order this week, saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the Justice Department defend a position it had never disputed in court. \"It was like he (the judge) was giving a homework assignment to an unprepared student,\" said one right-leaning lawyer, who opposes the health care law. \"It has the effect of putting the judiciary on the defensive, and could give rise to concerns the courts will look at the law from a political, not constitutional, perspective.\" The Supreme Court held three days of oral arguments on the health care last week. The justices have not, and by custom will not, comment on pending appeals. Their written opinions, due in the next three months, will be the final word on the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality, particularly the \"individual mandate\" provision that requires most Americans to have health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty.

According to an analysis of eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System, similarity is actually the key to a long-lasting relationship, even though people with opposite personalities may find themselves attracted to each other at first. The study of thousands of couples looked at patterns that made their relationships successful and found that while opposites attract initially, ultimately they 'attack' each other. Head-to-head: According to an analysis of eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System, similarity is actually the key to a long-lasting relationships, even though opposites may be attracted to each other at first . According to the study, opposites 'only attract for a short time', drawn at first to each other's intriguing an exciting differences. But ultimately, those differences come between them, leading to frustration and animosity. A submissive person might be attracted to someone who is dominant, for instance, but 'it could be better for two highly dominant people to be together,' says the study. 'While they may occasionally clash, they'll do so as equals and ultimately the relationship will be healthier.' 'While two dominants may occasionally clash, they'll do so as equals and ultimately the relationship will be healthier' Similarly, an introverted person may be drawn to an extrovert, because the extrovert's confidence makes the beginning stages of a relationship less stressful for an introvert. Nevertheless, the couple's differing social patterns - like the fact the extroverts thrive in big groups, whereas introverts are content with smaller groups - are likely to eventually cause tension in the relationship. Rather than pair up with someone with an opposite personality, singletons should seek out compatibility if they really want the relationship to endure."}]}

Simply looking through a small hole is enough to experience 3-D, says Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. His research was published in the journal Psychological Science. The 3-D technology that's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images, one from each eye, combining in the viewer's brain to produce 3-D's extra layer of depth. But Vishwanath's research suggests that both eyes aren't needed. \"We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). \"While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed,\" he said in a release from the university. \"Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies.\" In recent years, 3-D has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies, video games, TV and other media. But it also causes headaches, dizziness and even nausea for as many as 10% of the people who watch it. Some experts believe that cumbersome 3-D glasses are a primary reason why the technology hasn't caught on with TV viewers. The St. Andrews researchers say that, with the approach they explored, people with only one eye or those with problems watching 3-D with both eyes could still experience its \"compelling\" effect. \"Many of these people don't know what it means to see in 3D because they have never experienced it,\" Vishwanath said. \"Our findings and preliminary results suggest that our method could be used to allow people with misaligned eyes ... to experience what it is like to actually see in 3D.\" He said the study could have implications for movie producers and other industries. Vishwanath suggested that 3-D could one day be produced by dramatically increasing the resolution of images. That method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing 3-D glasses. The St. Andrews team is now testing the theory with a larger group of subjects. They plan to release more findings on 3-D this year."}]}

Situated in the Outback, it is close to nothing: The cities of Adelaide and Alice Springs are respectively nine hours south and eight hours north, and the nearest town -- William Creek, official population three -- takes 3\u00c2\u00bd hours to reach, provided the dirt roads aren't closed due to rain. Here, the earth is red, vegetation bare and temperatures extreme, but none of that stopped Westerners from setting up camp a century ago when they found opal shimmering in the dirt. Lots of opal. So they began digging, in more ways than one. As they mined the earth to discover one of the world's richest gem deposits, they also discovered why Westerners didn't settle in this barren, desolate region of Australia before: The heat. To battle temperatures that regularly reached above 110, settlers dug underground dwellings, a practice that continues to this day. In the heat of day, people are nowhere to be found, each hidden in a mine or dugout. One sees why outlaws chose to come here: It's far from anything, it's desolate, it's pockmarked with underground homes, and it offers the possibility of a fresh start and the hope of a fortune. Walking down the town's main drag today makes one feel like a real-life space cowboy and evokes an episode of \"Firefly.\" There's a reconstructed \"Star Wars\" spaceship, underground hotels, a Volkswagon beetle painted like an opal dangling from a store, signs for underground churches, a kangaroo orphanage, a couple of mining museums, underground home tours, and a pizza place that sells pies with toppings like kangaroo, emu sausage, sweet cranberry, asparagus, onions and Camembert. Its residents are known for being eccentric and hearty -- and if some are outlaws, they don't publicize it much on the street. What they do publicize is the town's international community, which represents more than 50 countries. There are olive groves for the Italians and Greeks, a Chinese restaurant so Asians can taste home and grocery stores with fare ranging from sweet chili sauce to imported Greek fondant and a whole kangaroo tail, complete with fur. All in a town of 1,900. Coober Pedy remains a popular tourist destination for those seeking an authentic Outback experience (or who want to see where films like \"Red Planet,\" \"Mad Max\" and \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" were filmed). Visitors often walk through the graveyard, where several tombstones are decorated with colored lights, and one even has, \"Have a drink on me,\" etched into it, with beer and wine bottles resting nearby, free of charge. They board a four-wheel drive mail truck for a 13-hour tour of Outback cattle stations and towns. And, of course, they sit on the hot, dusty earth, shooing away oddly persistent flies as they lose all sense of time searching for opal in the dirt, hoping that the next stone they turn might let them retire early. Outlaws came to Coober Pedy a century ago to find their fortune. Today, the town is an international community of residents united by their commitment to mining one of the world's most precious gems. Just as the town is home to the kind of diversity found in many cities, the opal that miners find so alluring, seductive, even, is a gem of many colors, with specks of pink, green, blue and red. It's a singular, unique, precious stone, and like Coober Pedy itself, what makes it so valuable is the rainbow inside. IF YOU GO . What to do . Outback Mail Run Tour: Guests travel 13 hours with an Australian mail carrier to deliver mail and supplies to five cattle stations (including the largest in Australia) and two towns (including one of the smallest in Australia). The tour provides a unique opportunity for visitors to experience the vastness of the Australian Outback and to learn about what it's really like to live there. Sunset, Ghosts and Stars Tour: Run by the Desert Cave Hotel, guests begin this tour by traveling 20 minutes outside town to the Breakaways, a geological formation of jagged hills marking what used to be the shorelines of an ancient ocean, to see the sunset. Once the stars have risen, guests travel back to the Old Cemetery in Coober Pedy, where a guide delights them with ghost stories of the town's most notable residents. Be sure to ask about Crocodile Harry! Old Timers Mine Museum: One of Coober Pedy's most popular destinations, the mine provides visitors with an opportunity to learn about the search for opal and the struggles of Coober Pedy's earliest miners. As part of the museum, guests have the chance to walk through an old-time dugout as well as a mineshaft. Fossicking: Tourists in Coober Pedy are welcome to dig for their own opal fortune at public fossicking sites in town. Simply sit on the red earth and look for shimmery rocks. Fossicking is free and guests usually find numerous low-quality opals. Ask any resident for directions to the nearest public fossicking site. Getting there . By plane: Regional Express operates a two-hour flight from Adelaide to Coober Pedy most days of the week. By train: The Ghan train operates a weekly service from Adelaide or Alice Springs to Manguri Station, 45 minutes outside Coober Pedy; transportation from the station must be arranged with hotels in advance, as there is no transportation at the station and trains from both cities arrive late at night. By bus: Greyhound offers daily service to Coober Pedy from both Adelaide and Alice Springs. Expect the trip from Adelaide to take 11 hours and the trip from Alice Springs to take eight. By car: Coober Pedy can be reached by car via a nine-hour drive from Adelaide or an eight-hour drive from Alice Springs. Drivers are warned not to drive through the Outback at night, because of the lack of gas stations and the threat of accidents caused by kangaroos; rain in the Outback may also render roads impassable, and drivers should not expect to have cell phone reception in the desert. Where to stay . Desert Cave Hotel: Located in the middle of Coober Pedy's main street, this is the town's only four-star hotel. Guests have the option to stay underground or aboveground. Underground rooms have ventilation but no windows. The Underground Motel: Offers underground accommodations to travelers with friendly hospitality. All rooms are underground with natural light and ventilation. Underground Bed and Breakfast: Owners Ana and Ken Male treat their guests to truly authentic Coober Pedy accommodation. Guests stay in underground rooms with a choice of en suite or shared bathrooms. Where to eat . John's Pizza Bar and Restaurant: Awards hang from the walls of John's, testifying to its reputation for having not only the finest pizza in Coober Pedy but some of the best in Australia. John's serves up not only traditional pies but also regional specialties like the Malu (smoked kangaroo, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, eggplant, marinated tomatoes, roasted peppers, eggplant and olives) and the Coat of Arms (sweet cranberry, mozzarella cheese, Camembert, emu metworst, spinach and smoked kangaroo). Pasta and sandwiches are also available. Tom and Mary's Greek Taverna: The place to go for Mediterranean food in the Outback. A favorite of locals and visitors alike, Tom and Mary impress visitors with authentic Greek fare. The restaurant is renowned for its seafood, especially the Saganaki prawns, so don't be afraid to try some fish in the desert. Also be sure to try some tzatziki -- the yogurt is made from scratch and the herbs are grown in the backyard. Then, with a full stomach, ask for directions to Coober Pedy's olive grove to continue that Greece-in-Australia experience. Hutchinson Street, Coober Pedy . Umberto's: Located in the Desert Cave Hotel, Umberto's is Coober Pedy's finest dining establishment, and is known for its Mod-Oz cuisine, including regional specialties like kangaroo, camel, emu and Australian beef. Italian food is also on the menu. The Pink Roadhouse (Oodnadatta): Situated in a largely aboriginal town of fewer than 300 people, this combo restaurant, grocery store and post office looms over the town in all its pink, hand-painted-sign splendor. The restaurant is known throughout Australia for its iconic Oodnaburger, which is composed of meat seasoned with secret spices, onion, cheese, egg, bacon, pineapple, lettuce, beetroot and tomato. The Outback Mail Run Tour stops here for lunch. William Creek Hotel (William Creek): Owned by two of the three permanent residents in South Australia's tiniest settlement, the William Creek Hotel serves a changing menu of fresh schnitzel, burgers and curries. The walls are covered with photos and business cards from folks who have passed through, and the owners always welcome friendly conversation and questions about what it's like to live in such rural territory. If visitors are too tired to move after eating, they can stay in one of the pub's hotel rooms. The Outback Mail Run Tour stops here for dinner."}]}

While many moons show signs of their age, with pockmarked surface and craters, Titan manages to retain its youthful looks - are researcher have finally found out the secret behind its youthful appearance. The secret to eternal youth, they found is simple - sand. Dunes of exotic, hydrocarbon sand are . slowly but steadily filling in its craters, according to new research . using observations from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Images from the Cassini spacecraft show a 'fresh' crater called Sinlap (left) and an extremely degraded crater called Soi (right) that has been filled in by sand. These craters are both about 50 miles (80 kilometers) in diameter . Titan is the only moon in the solar . system with a thick atmosphere, and the only world besides Earth known . to have lakes and seas on its surface. However, Titan has a frigid . surface temperature of around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (94 kelvins). The rain that falls from Titan's skies is not water, but contains . liquid methane and ethane, compounds that are gases at Earth's . temperatures. 'Most of the Saturnian satellites - Titan's siblings - have thousands and thousands of craters on their surface,'  said Catherine Neish, a Cassini radar team associate based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. 'So far on Titan, of the 50 percent of the surface that we've seen in high resolution, we've only found about 60 craters,' she said. 'It's possible that there are many more craters on Titan, but they are not visible from space because they are so eroded. 'We typically estimate the age of a planet's surface by counting the number of craters on it (more craters means an older surface). 'But if processes like stream erosion or drifting sand dunes are filling them in, it's possible that the surface is much older that it appears. 'This research is the first quantitative estimate of how much the weather on Titan has modified its surface,'adds Neish. Neish and her team compared craters on Titan to craters on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Ganymede is a giant moon with a water ice crust, similar to Titan, so craters on the two moons should have similar shapes. However, Ganymede has almost no atmosphere and thus no wind or rain to erode its surface. 'We found that craters on Titan were on average hundreds of yards shallower than similarly sized craters on Ganymede, suggesting that some process on Titan is filling its craters,' said Neish, who is lead author of a paper about this research published online in the journal Icarus. Titan captured in front of Saturn. Researchers say it may be older than they thought . Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with a trace of methane and other, more complex molecules made of hydrogen and carbon (hydrocarbons). The source of Titan's methane remains a mystery. 'Since the sand appears to be produced from the atmospheric methane, Titan must have had methane in its atmosphere for at least several hundred million years in order to fill craters to the levels we are seeing,\" says Neish. However, researchers estimate Titan's current supply of methane should be broken down by sunlight within tens of millions of years, so Titan either had a lot more methane in the past, or it is being replenished somehow. 'The presence of liquids on the surface and in the near subsurface can also cause extensive modification to crater shape, as is observed on Earth,' says Neish."}]}

Contaminated jalape\u00f1o and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, are no longer in circulation, the FDA said. \"The number of reported cases has been dropping since early July,\" and the number has appeared to return to around the typical number of salmonella cases expected during this time of year, said Dr. Robert Tauxe, the deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases. \"There are some cases of this infection that occur every year,\" he said. Initial results from a CDC and Food and Drug Administration investigation found that jalape\u00f1o peppers appeared to be a major carrier of the bacteria, as were serrano peppers, Tauxe said. Tomatoes -- identified early in the outbreak as the culprit -- were still possibly a source, he said. The FDA said the contaminated jalape\u00f1o and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, were no longer in circulation and said Thursday that it was lifting its advice to avoid eating raw jalape\u00f1o and serrano peppers grown, harvested or packed in Mexico. The agency had lifted its advice to consumers last month to avoid several types of tomatoes. At least 286 people were hospitalized from the salmonella Saintpaul strain, which began in April, and it may have contributed to two deaths, Tauxe said. \"Most persons became ill in May, June and early July,\" he said. The outbreak touched 43 states as well as Washington and Canada, Tauxe explained. \"This was a very large and complex outbreak,\" he said, noting that it was unusual to have two food carriers with the bacteria. It was the largest  foodborne outbreak -- based on confirmed cases -- in the last 10 years, the CDC said. Investigators had traced a contaminated jalapeno pepper found in a Texas produce distribution firm to a farm in Tamaulipas, Mexico. They found contaminated serrano peppers and irrigation systems at another farm in that same region. However, Dr. David Acheson of the FDA said they were not prepared to rule out the possibility that there were other sources. \"If you've got salmonella Saintpaul in a water supply on a farm, you've got to ask the question about how it got into the water, whether it was connected to canal systems -- the irrigation systems could have caused that contamination to go elsewhere,\" he said."}]}

The rising generation, which is known as Generation Z, wants more healthy and fresh ingredients than the older portion of the population ever did. According to a new report by market research group NPD, the youngest generation of consumers - which includes everyone up to the age of 23 - is more inclined to eat fresh greens and home-cooked meals than their predecessors, Generations Y and X. This signals an overall trend toward healthier eating, says the report. Generation salad: According to a new report by NPD market research group, Generation Z (everyone up to age 23) is more inclined to eat fresh ingredients and home-cooked meals than their predecessors . Fresh food . consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next . five years, due to the eating habits of Generation Z, with salad . consumption in particular on the rise. Also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and 'better-for-you' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars, as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking. Indeed, Generation Z exhibits a tendency to use stove tops instead of microwaves for preparing meals. This is in contrast to Gen X consumers (considered as everyone between the ages of 38 and 48), who are more focused on convenience and therefore more likely to prepare microwaveable foods. In fact, the rising generation tends to spend more time in general in the kitchen, meaning home-made breakfasts like omelets and French toast are set to overtake packaged cereals and oatmeal. Trends: Also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and 'better-for-you' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars, as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking . Involved: Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, says Gen Z 'wants to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project' Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, pointed out on his blog that it may seem counter-intuitive that the younger generation - which is typically time-pressed - is spending more time in the kitchen. But he explains the logic behind it, writing: 'There seems to be a need to have their say or approval on the final product. 'It's almost as if they want to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project.' Changing habits: Fresh food consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next five years, and the consumption of convenient microwaveable meals will decrease . He added that younger consumers are increasingly using additives - i.e. putting fruits or syrups on their foods - for the same reason, to feel more involved in the overall process. Judging by growing food trends, having what is typically considered a side dish as a main meal is another eating habit that will continue to become more popular. And with Hispanics making up a large percentage of Millennials as well as Gen Z, the NPD group expects the consumption of Latino foods to grow by seven per cent in the next five years."}]}

The group also plans to produce ten . music videos from its album Songs for a Healthier America--which have . titles like U R What You Eat and Veggie Luv. The album is due out . September 2013. Singers such as Ashanti and Jordin Sparks make appearances, as well as Dr. Oz - yes, he's rapping, or at least trying to - but one can't help wonder if Jay Z sent the call about this project straight to voice mail. This move is yet another in the first . lady\u2019s campaign against childhood obesity, a condition that affects . African American children disproportionately to whites. It is estimated that 50 percent of African American youths are obese. \u2018I think hip-hop in particular \u2013 so many kids love hip-hop. It's such a core part of our culture,\u2019 Let's Move! Executive Director and White House assistant chef Sam Kass told U.S. News. \u2018And particularly in the African-American community and the Latino community which is being disproportionately affected by those health issues.\u2019 'It's your body, tell somebody': Called 'Everybody,' the video features Jordin Sparks among other big names singing about healthy eating and Let's Move! hopes to release nine more videos once the album is out September 30 . Star studded: The video came out in June and features TV personality Dr. Oz singing about eating right along with Jordin Sparks, Fresh E. Fresh and other performers . The White House\u2019s program was first inspired by the efforts of Hip Hop Public Health, which began in 2005. \u2018[We] started looking at the communities with obesity in New York, and a lot of these communities just happened to be poor communities, and happened to be African-American, Hispanic, Latino,\u2019 said the group\u2019s founder Olajide Williams. \u2018We needed to develop an interventionary tool for the community. Hip-hop was born as a platform to bring our interventions to the youth.\u2019 Then, this past June, the first video from the collaboration was released. Called \u2018Everybody,\u2019 the song features the music stylings of Jordin Sparks, Doug E. Fresh, and others, along with cameos in the video from Dr. Oz and Michelle Obama herself. In the first song out from the first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign's hip hop album, TV medical personality and Oprah Winfrey scion Dr. Oz raps with Hip Hop MD. On his latex-gloved hand, Dr. Oz wears several big gold rings. He also wears a bejeweled stethoscope around his neck. Dr. Oz has a vegetable-themed rap session with his gold chain wearing colleague Hip Hop MD . They sing: . You gotta watch your calories, what you're taking in. Now, to balance out your calories you gotta hit the gym. Never thought a cardiac surgeonAnd a neurologist. Will talk exercise,Not politics. You only got one life to live. Live healthy, that's what it is!LET'S GO! For his cameo, Dr. Oz sports a jewel-encrusted stethescope and raps alongside a sort of hip hop parallel to himself, Hip Hop MD. In her appearance, Obama recalls the first days of her Let\u2019s Move program when people wondered if they could really make a difference in childhood obesity. Now, as the group prepares to release what is likely to be its most visible campaign yet, FLOTUS may be about to find out. 'Everybody': Doug E. Fresh and Jordin Sparks sing about vegetables and staying positive in the first single from the album Songs for a Healthier America called Everybody . Once the videos are complete, Obama and her collaborators intend to distribute them to schools first in New York City and then in Washington, DC, San Antonio, and Philadelphia with the hope they'll be played during recess or between periods. For his part, Kass believes Songs for a Healthier America is going to be a winner, thanks in no small part to the way they\u2019ve chosen to reach out. \u2018Cultural leaders and visionaries in our country can give these messages to kids in a way that's not preachy,\u2019 he said. \u2018Kids are going to be dancing and listening to the music.\u2019"}]}

Surfing will try to wipe out drug cheats with a radical move to bring in comprehensive testing for the first time. The sport's international governing body, the Association of Surfing Professionals,  will roll out a policy for screening competitors this year. Surfing has long been associated with 1960s and 70s counter culture and the recreational use of marijuana and LSD. Surfer Andy Irons died from a heart attack with traces of crystal meth, methadone and cocaine in his blood . But now the sport is cracking down on its growing culture of performance enhancing drugs at its top level. It comes after the death of the triple world champion Andy Irons, from Hawaii, in November 2010. A postmortem found he died from a heart attack and 'acute mixed drug ingestion'. Traces of methadone, methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, and a metabolite of cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Another professional surfer, Anthony Ruffo, a 47-year-old pioneer of the Santa Cruz scene in the 1980s, is facing a possible jail sentence for selling methamphetamine after he was caught with an ounce of the drug. ASP spokesman Dave Prodan told the Guardian: 'We believe this is a natural evolution in enhancing the professionalism of our sport.' Former world champion Andy Irons, of Hawaii, pictured holding up three fingers to the crowds as he claimed his third world championship title at the Nova Schin Festival at Imbituba, Brazil . Neco Padaratz (centre), who was suspended after he tested positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids, ride out on the world's longest surfboard in 2005 . He added that the ASP have been in discussions over regulations with the World Anti Doping Agency for more than two years. Professional . surfers compete for prizes of up to $100,000 (\u00a365,000) and testing is . already carried out at some European events and in the UK and Ireland. In 2005, the Brazilian surfer Neco Padaratz was suspended after he tested positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids at an event in Hossegor on the French Atlantic coast. Peter Davi, a pioneering big wave surfer, was found to have high levels of methamphetaine in his blood after he died in December 2007 riding a 20m wave off California. He sustained head and chest injuries, probably from being dashed against jagged rocks. Gerry Fitzgerald, a professional in Ireland, said that for most surfers, the idea of taking drugs before tackling dangerous waves was anathema. 'I have seen guys who are stoners and they drop off the scene because it is not sustainable,' he said. 'Athletes are training hard. The way the contests are now, it will catch up with you.' Pancho Sullivan, a professional surfer from Hawaii said he supported the new testing regime despite a tradition of recreational drug use in the sport."}]}

Like any thoughtful citizen, Tracey Hayes always stops to pick up stray crisp packets and sweet wrappers in her local park without expecting any thanks. But when she paused to brush away some excess fur from her two dogs while she was walking there, the jobsworths pounced \u2013 and handed her a \u00a350 fine for littering. Two council wardens told Mrs Hayes, 46, she had committed an offence after they spotted her brushing her golden retriever Biskit and German shepherd Rocky. Tracey Hayes brushed the coats of golden retriever Biskit and German shepherd Rocky in a Hornchurch park but was fined \u00a350 by council wardens for littering . It was one of the hottest days of the year, and grooming her pets helped to cool them down. Mrs Hayes says she was then prevented . from clearing up the hair and claims the two officers drove off without . clearing it up themselves. The mother-of-two from Romford in . Essex said: \u2018I spend so much time cleaning up litter in parks the fact . that I have now been given a fine is ironic \u2013 they never see you do any . good stuff. \u2018I always leave the dogs\u2019 hair out in my garden for the birds and I haven\u2019t met a single person to say anything against it.\u2019 Mrs Hayes, pictured with Rocky, said she always leaves dog hair out in her garden in Romford for the birds . The incident unfolded when Mrs Hayes was waiting for her son to finish football practice at Harrow Lodge Park, Hornchurch. She claims the park wardens pulled in . front of her car as she tried to leave.

Mrs Hayes said: \u2018I have owned dogs for over . ten years and have never heard of such a law. Paula Robson was fined by council wardens in County Durham for clearing up another dog's mess instead of her labrador Derik's - even though she cleaned that up too . Tracey Hayes is not the first victim of over-zealous council officials. Earlier this week it emerged a woman was fined \u00a375 after she fed a piece of pastry from a pasty to a pigeon and then binned the packet in Bolton town centre. The council has since backed down over the fine. In 2009, Vanessa Kelly, 26, was fined \u00a375 for feeding bread to ducks with her toddler in Smethwick, West Midlands. The year before, Sarah Davies was issued with a \u00a375 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her young daughter. A\u00a0 judge hearing her appeal in Hull later threw the case out. \u2018I can\u2019t deny it wasn\u2019t a lot of hair, but it looked far worse when it was all spread out. \u2018What has disappointed me most was he . was going to give me that fine no matter what \u2013 even though I offered . to clear it up.\u2019 Mrs Hayes said the park officers then sped off without . binning the hair, which she put in her car to throw away at home.

The club have said that the problem was identified during the medical and that they chose to proceed with the transfer regardless because they are confident he will play an\u00a0 important part later in the season.

The maps were created by London-based company The Eco Experts, using data from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, known as the ND-Gain Index. They took into account location, terrain, pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected. Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark score well on the scale. But places like Central America, Africa and India all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope, said The Eco Experts. Jon Whiting, of The Eco Experts warned: \u2018Hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards, droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas, and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects.\u2019 Burundi, Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo produced some of the lowest scores, meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters."}]}

'She had positive people back in her . life,' Cheryl Nunley told The Associated Press, holding back tears while . sitting with family and friends in a tiny apartment a few blocks away . from the crime scene. 'She's not perfect. She ran around . with some people she shouldn't have been running around with, but she . was getting her life back together.' Misty Nunley was found murdered on Monday, along with Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 23 - twin sister who were both mothers of young children - and Julie Jackson, 55. Also in the apartment was a 3-year-old boy who is believed to have witnessed the entire shooting. He was unharmed. Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday. He . added: 'Right now, we have no clear-cut suspect. I don't want to strike . fear in the community tonight, but we do have an individual or . individuals who murdered four people. Do we know if there was a motive, . like a jealous lover? We don't know that. We can't say if it was random . or if someone knew [the victims].' Relatives and neighbors have told Nunley's family there may have been a romantic spat between one of the women who lived at the apartment and a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Police wouldn't comment on those rumors. Tragic twins: Rebeika Powell, left, and Kayetie Melchor, right, were shot to death on Monday . Murdered: The bodies of Rebeika Powell, left, and twin sister Kayetie Melchor, were found in the apartment building with two others . Mystery: Police have not yet determined a suspect or a motive in the killings, which occurred in a crime-ridden area of Tulsa . Mothers: Both of the twins had young children when their lives were tragically cut short on Monday . In an interview with CBS News, Rebeika and Kayetie's grief-stricken father, Larry Powell cried out: 'My life's gone. My kids are gone.' According to reports, police and EMS . workers were called to the apartment near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue . at 12:36 p.m. after an unidentified person stumbled across the corpses. At the run-down apartment complex, . bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows . behind a black wrought-iron gate.

Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years. She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday. 'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.' Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead . Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions. 'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said. Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer. Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.' 'The victims were shot multiple times,' Tulsa Police Officer Jillian Roberson told\u00a0NBC News. Police immediately began canvassing the area trying to find any witnesses to the crime, aside from the child who is believed to have been in the residence when the shooting occurred.

A Californian teenager called Bobbie Beale who had never heard of EastEnders was swamped with abuse on Twitter last night from people demanding to know if she was a killer. More than a million tweets were sent during the BBC soap's live episodes, which revealed that 11-year-old Bobby Beale killed sister Lucy by hitting her over the head with a jewellery box. But some of the messages were aimed at the American Bobbie, who thought she was being accused of murdering her dog Lucy. For some time she was left bewildered after receiving a number of accusing messages from fans of the soap. She wrote at first: 'Why are 3 people from Scotland that I don't know, tweeting me about killing someone named Lucy?' The messages from the UK continued with a mystified Miss Beale asking: 'Who are you?' and explaining she was a not a boy. She then posted a selfie alongside the hashtag #IdidntKillLucy. She said: 'I starting getting tweets in the afternoon. It was pretty confusing because I thought they were talking about by dog Lucy. 'I looked up the show and I thought, Oh, this makes sense now, but at first I was really confused because I thought it was a real-life thing and I thought Bobby Beale killed someone and I was like, \"It's not me\".' 'I got 1,500 new followers and 15,000 retweets. I was in class and my phone died because of all the notifications. 'I have definitely not killed my sister and definitely not killed my dog'. The nation, gripped by the mystery of Lucy Beale's murder, shared its thoughts on the twists and turns of the two episodes, climaxing in more than 30,000 tweets in the single minute after Bobby was revealed to be the killer. Mistaken identity: Bobbie Beale is an American student and Bobby Beale is a fictional character revealed as the killer of his sister last night . First tweet: Bobbie Beale first asked her followers why people in Scotland said she was a killer . Response: In the face of hundreds of tweets Miss Beale began trying to inform followers of the mistake . Fears: Initially she thought trolls from Britain were for some reason accusing her of killing her pet dog Lucy . Last month\u00a0American Twitter users\u00a0ITV political editor Tom Bradby by people who'd confused him with NFL star Tom Brady . Thousands abused him over 'deflategate' - a row over ball pressure in a key NFL match.

Maggie Simpson did it. \u00a3EELive' The hot topic quickly became the top tending item on Twitter, with fans all over the country using #KillerReactions to respond to the BBC One soap's shocking plot twist. One fan tweeted: 'Every person in the country with a younger brother is sleeping with one eye open tonight.' Another tweet that quickly went viral was a picture of Bobby wearing a cap with the caption 'I'm real Bobby Shmurda. Straight savage from Walford,' playing on the name of American rapper Bobby Shmurda. Exchanges: The tweets began arriving at around 9.30pm uk time when it emerged that Bobby was the killer . Confused: But Miss Beale was still struggling to comprehend why people were so interested in her account . Another quick-off-the-mark fan even set up a 'Bobby Beale' parody account immediately after the revelation. The account tweeted: 'I remember the day well... Was high off some orange juice. That blonde cow doing my nut in... It was time for her to go.' Another tweet read: 'Yeah, I'm white, ten and a cold hearted murderer. Lucy Beale? Nah man, never heard of her.' 'Looking for a lawyer who specialises in Murder. If you have any information, call my old man. Money ain't a factor.' Others drew comparisons between Bobby and Psycho killer Norman Bates, claiming he was a young version of the fictional character in Alfred Hitchcock's film. The hilarious posts quickly went viral online after being retweeted thousands of times."}]}

He'll learn June 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version. A verdict by the Lille court will be read on that date. The onetime contender for the French presidency has denied investigators' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes. \"For the first time, throughout these last hearings, I felt I could explain myself and I have the feeling I have been listened to,\" Strauss-Kahn said. Strauss-Kahn appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the Lille prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence. Lille Prosecutor Frederic Fevre's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago: that the evidence didn't support the charges. But investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial, which began two weeks ago. Investigators alleged that the sex parties, in locations such as Belgium, New York and Washington, stemmed from a prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille. Strauss-Kahn, who was married to French TV journalist Anne Sinclair until their divorce in 2013, has never denied that he took part in the parties. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved. In testimony last week, he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda, but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him. \"I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever,\" he said last week. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. Prosecutors allege that two other defendants, businessman David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director, picked up the bills for the sex parties. Strauss-Kahn saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011. He was later cleared of the New York allegations. Before that scandal erupted, he had been on track to run for the French presidency -- an election that his Socialist Party later won with Francois Hollande as its candidate. The Lille prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing a lack of evidence. However, the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations. A judgment in the case could come \"within months,\" Fevre's spokeswoman, Maud Perraudeau, said Tuesday. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report."}]}

A staggering 800 police officers across England and Wales are currently off sick with stress-related illnesses, it was reported today. A survey of the 43 police forces found that smaller, largely rural forces have some of the highest proportions of officers off work with stress. In total 787 officers were listed as currently signed off for stress, but as only 35 forces responded to the Freedom of Information request the real figure could be much higher. The latest allegations about the finances of the Federation - described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg (stock picture) It means the taxpayer is footing the bill which is estimated to be just under \u00a329 million a year. However, it is not known how long each officer has been signed off. Experienced police constables earn . \u00a336,500 a year while senior officers earn much more, The Sunday Telegraph reported. The pay scale for a superintendent rises to \u00a372,585 a year. The highest sick rate was in Derbyshire Constabulary, which reported 30 officers were signed off with stress, amounting to 1.64 per cent of their total number. In comparison, the Metropolitan Police - . by far the biggest force in England and Wales - reported 101 officers . were off with stress, amounting to just 0.33 per cent of their total . numbers. The second highest proportion of officers off sick was West Midlands, with 1.58 per cent. The Metropolitan Police - by far the biggest force in England and Wales - reported 101 officers were off with stress, amounting to just 0.33 per cent of their total numbers . And the third was in Bedfordshire - the fourth smallest force in the country - which reported 1.56 per cent, or 17 of its 1,092 officers. Greater Manchester Police, the second largest force in England and Wales, had 71 officers off with stress, or 0.99 per cent of their 7,200 total. Workers will be referred for health assessments if they are sick for more than four weeks under a new scheme to be launched by the Department for Work and Pensions. Under the Health and Work Service scheme, assessments will carried out by occupational specialists to draw up a plan and timetable to get the patient back to work quickly. Employees will be referred by a GP or their employer but the assessments are not compulsory. Up to 960,000 workers in Britain were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013, according to new figures released by the DWP. Employers face a yearly bill of around \u00a39 billion for sick pay and associated costs, with individuals missing out on \u00a34 billion a year in lost earnings. The DWP believes the scheme, to be launched in England, Scotland and Wales, will save employers \u00a370 million a year and cut the time people spend off work by 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Across England and Wales there were 128,350 officers at the end of September 2013, a drop of nearly 3,500 in 12 months and the lowest number since September 2002. The figures come on the back of savage budget cuts being enforced. When the Coalition came to power it said it would reduce government police grants by 20 per cent over the four years to 2015. As a result the number of officers in England and Wales will fall by 16,000 from 140,000 and pay and pensions are being shaken up. A spokesman for the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Our members are being asked to do more and more with fewer resources and while they have risen admirably to the challenge it is inevitable that the increased pressures they\u2019re facing will have an impact on their health and wellbeing.' Phil Mason, Derbyshire's head of human resources, said: 'We are surprised that our stress-related absences are higher than other police forces as we do benchmark overall absence with other forces and there has been no indication that our absence levels are significantly higher.' 'Derbyshire Constabulary offers all staff a full confidential care employee assistance programme which includes counselling and emotional support. We offer referrals to our Occupational Support Unit to assist officers with stress-related conditions, recovery and a return to work plan.'"}]}

Of the 26 settlements, 23 are signed and three are agreed in principle, with final documentation expected within the next few weeks, the school said. The school also indicated a few other settlements still could come. \"There was no happiness,\" said Tom Kline, the attorney for a man known as Victim 5 from Sandusky's criminal trial. \"For my client, there was relief.\" Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts relating to the sexual abuse of young boys. He's serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence. He has always maintained his innocence and has plans to appeal, his attorney has said. In all, 32 men have come forward to Penn State with claims of abuse. Some of those were rejected for lack of merit, Penn State said. \"We hope this is another step forward in the healing process for those hurt by Mr. Sandusky, and another step forward for Penn State,\" university President Rodney Erickson said in a statement. \"We cannot undo what has been done, but we can and must do everything possible to learn from this and ensure it never happens again at Penn State.\" As part of the agreement, this settlement ends the civil litigation for these 26 men. Kline said these victims will not be able to sue anyone else, including Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, where prosecutors say he selected most of his victims. However, Penn State can go after the charity to recoup some of its losses, Kline said. Although the criminal trial involved only 10 victims, more allegations surfaced in the months that followed Sandusky's November 2011 arrest. Abuse as far back as the 1970s has been reported to authorities. Kline praised Penn State lawyers in regard to the settlement process, saying they worked methodically through each claim, making it possible to settle in just about 13 months. Not all the settlements are equal of amounts, Kline said, but were evaluated separately based on when the abuse allegedly happened. Prosecutors have said that Penn State officials -- former President Graham Spanier, former Vice President Gary Schultz, and former Athletic Director Tim Curley -- all knew about two allegations against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001. The 1998 incident was investigated and dismissed by prosecutors at the time, but the 2001 incident was never reported to police by university officials. Victim 5 was abused six months after that 2001 incident, and so his settlement and others who say they were abused after 2001 had more negotiating power, Kline said. Curley, Schultz, and Spanier are all facing trial this Spring on charges including perjury, conspiracy, obstruction, failure to report suspected abuse and endangering the welfare of children. They also maintain their innocence. The scandal has so far cost Penn State university tens of millions of dollars, including a $60 million NCAA fine, and millions more in crisis management."}]}

The supermarket will introduce a range of apples that have been damaged by poor weather conditions alongside its normal selection of more attractive fruit. Britain\u2019s top supermarkets have been criticised for wasting tonnes of misshapen fruit and vegetables that is considered too ugly to be sold. Waitrose has decided to tackle the obsession with perfect produce, stocking specifically labelled Cripps Pink, Braeburn, Royal Gala and Cox varieties of apples. Perfectly edible: Waitrose is to start selling a range of \u00bfblemished\u00bf fruit in an attempt to curb colossal levels of food waste . The supermarket also announced last week that it would sell packets of mixed tomatoes \u2013 one of the most wasted products \u2013 that are misshapen or have been bashed after falling from the vine. The apples in the \u2018weather-blemished\u2019 line originate from Waitrose-backed farms in Africa where unseasonal weather has left up to 70 per cent of crops damaged. Waitrose apple buyer Greg Sehringer said: \u2018We are lucky that our customers are savvy enough who understand the unpredictability of farming and to trust that the fruit will be just as delicious, even if the apples don\u2019t look as perfect as usual.\u2019 An estimated  fifteen million tons of food valued at \u00a319billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year . Strict EU rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables were relaxed in 2009 following years of criticism. Marketing standards detailing acceptable sizes and shapes were scrapped altogether for 26 types of produce, including carrots, cauliflowers, cucumbers, leeks, plums and onions. However they were kept in place for a number of popular items, including tomatoes, apples, grapes and pears - meaning that \u2018substandard\u2019 produce has to be specially labelled. But a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers last year found that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in Britain ends up never being eaten. It found that 30 per cent never make it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly to be sold. While there are no exact figures on the amount of food discarded by supermarkets, a House of Lords inquiry this year heard that fifteen million tons of food valued at \u00a319billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year. Illustrating the amount of supermarket water, Tesco revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables. Speaking about Waitrose\u2019s decision to introduce the range, the NFU\u2019s Guy Poskitt said: \u2018Of course I welcome this news, but as farmers we\u2019re always keen to get as much value back to the farm and reduce waste, so none of us intend to grow inferior produce. \u2018And if supermarkets market these so-called ugly vegetables as a cheaper alternative, what will happen in good years when we have bumper crops of attractive produce? \u2018The last thing we want to end up doing is putting our best produce in value ranges.\u2019"}]}

The World Health Organization lists dengue fever as a \"neglected disease\" and estimates that there may be 50 to 100 million dengue infections worldwide each year. However, research published last year suggested that around 390 million people are infected each year -- more than triple the WHO's estimate. Spread by a type of of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), the disease thrives in tropical mega cities like Guangzhou thanks to rapid urbanization and population movement. Climate change is also a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitos can survive. CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report ."}]}

It comes as hilarious footage emerged of a woman reacting to a huge lightning strike during a storm - and went viral after it was uploaded to YouTube.

More than 10,000 homes were blacked out as a result of the late Sunday storms which swept through northern New South Wales . A number of fires are also burning across the state after being sparked by lightning strikes . The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) reports that it is battling 90 blazes so far, 47 of which are deemed out of control. Most were caused by lightning strikes late on Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW RFS spokesman Ben Shepherd said. The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the unsettled conditions were being caused by a slow-moving low-pressure trough, with forecast of storms in southern and western parts of the state. Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. He said: 'This time of the year it\u2019s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.' The November to January temperature outlooks indicate a warmer than normal season for both daytime and night-time temperatures across most of Australia. 'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott. 'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.' 'It's not unusual, it's the summer pattern arriving and we have a lot of moisture in the air,' said Ms Westcott. According to the Weather Bureau, this time of the year it\u2019s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why Australians can experience very hot and cold in the same day .

People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, the researchers say. The advice comes amid an obesity crisis, with one adult in every four in England obese and three in 10 children between two and 15 overweight or obese. Scroll down for video . Fat fighter:\u00a0People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, researchers say . The researchers analysed clinical trials on four popular weight-loss diet plans: the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet; the South Beach diet, which distinguishes 'good' and 'bad' carbs and fats; the Weight Watchers calorie-counting diet; and the Zone diet, which stipulates a 3:4 ratio of protein to carbohydrates. They compared them with what they dubbed 'usual care', which refers to traditional methods to promote weight loss such as low-fat diets, behavioural weight loss intervention, nutritional counselling, or self-help materials. In trials comparing Weight Watchers to usual care, Weight Watchers dieters lost an average 7.7 to 13.2 pounds after a year compared to 1.8 to 11.9 pounds with usual care. However, after two years the weight lost was partially regained. In the only trial comparing the South Beach diet to usual care, no difference in weight loss occurred in 12 months, however the participants in this study were both severely obese and had undergone gastric bypass surgery. There are millions of people in Britain who aren't getting sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals. Doctors say our growing reliance on fast food, coupled with soaring rates of binge-drinking, means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health. The result, in the most extreme cases, is pot-bellies, wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world. While malnutrition can be fatal, in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life, from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy. Results from trials on the Atkins diet were inconsistent. Trials involving head-to-head comparisons between Atkins, Weight Watchers, Zone and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year, as did those in the control group who received the usual care. Those on the Atkins diet lost an average 4.6 to 10.3lbs; Weight Watchers participants lost an average 6.6lbs; Zone dieters lost an average 3.5 to 7lbs; and control lost about 4.85lbs. In studies involving head-to-head comparisons, there were no marked differences between Atkins, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets at improving cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, or other cardiovascular risk factors. The longest diet studies researchers analysed lasted for two years, and results were only available for the Atkins or Weight Watchers diets. Those studies found dieters regained some of their weight over time. Choose one: Trials involving head-to-head comparisons between Atkins, Weight Watchers, Zone and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year, as did those in the control group . Senior author Dr Mark Eisenberg, Professor of Medicine at Jewish General Hospital/McGill University in Canada, said: 'Despite their popularity and important contributions to the multi-million dollar weight loss industry, we still do not know if these diets are effective to help people lose weight and decrease their risk factors for heart disease. 'With such a small number of trials looking at each diet and their somewhat conflicting results, there is only modest evidence that using these diets is beneficial in the long-term.' Dr Eisenberg said to better understand the potential benefits from any one or all of these diets, researchers need to conduct large clinical trials directly comparing all four popular diets for long-term weight loss and changes in other heart disease risk factors. He added: 'A broader lifestyle intervention, which also involves doctors and other health professionals, may be more effective. 'This also tells doctors that popular diets on their own may not be the solution to help their patients lose weight.' The findings were published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Just as Americans are staring down flu season, Hong Kong grabbed headlines this week with news confirming that a chicken was infected with the H5N1 virus and that many more suspected of harboring the dangerous disease were slaughtered. In the recent movie \"Contagion\", Hollywood's version of a pandemic, the government successfully executes a response plan. But our real-life encounter with a pandemic, the H1N1 flu, raises serious questions of whether the American public is prepared for such a crisis. It should have been good news that the H1N1 epidemic we confronted in 2009-10 was less deadly than feared, but instead, it was used as political leverage. Conservatives, in particular, claimed the vaccination recommendations were overhyped, more \"big government\" meddling in citizens' lives. What's worse, many media outlets highlighted the critical narrative while minimizing strong evidence that the government handled the threat quite well under the difficult circumstances. This occurred as opinion polls revealed the public's growing lack of confidence in government officials and institutions, which are now at record levels . Is it any wonder, then, that, despite extensive planning and billions of dollars, the public will be unprepared for the next time? The reason lies in our deep distrust of government and thus, our unwillingness to believe the experts' claim that vaccination is the single best method for preventing the spread of disease. To be sure, Americans have both historical and contemporary reasons for suspecting that government officials may not be diligent in protecting the public's health over powerful interests. The history of epidemics is replete with boneheaded government actions that trampled the rights of marginal populations in the interests of protecting the so-called larger public. Nearly every major American epidemic has targeted the poor or an ethnic minority group as objects of blame in efforts to prevent the spread of disease. As late as the 2003 SARS outbreak, New Yorkers shunned the city's Chinatown amid rumors that undocumented immigrants had brought the disease to America. By some estimates, business fell by 70% although not a single case from that neighborhood was ever diagnosed. In this media environment it is harder than ever for us to know who to trust and how to separate fact from fiction. During the H1N1 pandemic, radio personalities such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh implied that choosing not to take the vaccine was a litmus test of ideological commitment to opposing the Obama administration. Some opponents of the administration's proposed health care reform legislation delighted in the vaccine production delays and questioned its safety and effectiveness, saying it was proof of the government's incompetence to \"run health care.\" Two senators commanded a news cycle by demanding the secretary of Health and Human Services explain the shortage, joining the chorus of those accusing the government of wildly overestimating the production schedule and making false promises . Within two weeks of such grandstanding, there was a surplus of vaccine, although well over half of those questioned in polls said they believed there was not enough vaccine for all who wanted it. Too many are willing to accept, if not engage in, factual distortions to create their own comfortable reality. Public opinion polls around the time of the H1N1 danger revealed nearly a 20-point difference between Democrats' and Republicans' intention to seek the vaccine. Republicans not only were less inclined to take it, they were also more inclined to doubt the disease was as serious as health officials claimed. Our continued willingness to follow politicians who are leading us astray is to our own detriment. Admittedly, it takes considerably more effort to critically evaluate the accuracy of information we receive, especially if inconvenient, than to simply accept what we want to hear, but we have no other choice. Acting responsibly will literally be a matter of life and death. In the end, fewer than 20% of Americans took the vaccine, with over half of the population indicating they didn't believe the government message that the vaccine was safe and effective. Ironically, Hollywood has now legitimated the public's skepticism by including a scene in \"Contagion\" in which a reporter asks the fictional CDC official how he knows the epidemic threat is not \"another false alarm\" like the H1N1. Take it from me: H1N1 was not a false alarm, nor were the government recommendations to address it hyperbolic. In the uncertainty of a crisis environment, government officials provided effective leadership. The distortions of politicians, ideologues and certain media outlets did us a disservice. Fewer Americans than expected died or required hospitalization, but next time, we might not be so lucky. Ultimately, it's up to us to see through the politicizing and headline grabbing and protect ourselves. As Pogo observed, \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Gerwin."}]}

A baby girl who underwent open heart surgery at just 30 minutes old has been allowed home for the first time ever to celebrate Christmas. Five-month-old Jessica Muse is believed to be the youngest person ever to undergo open heart surgery after she had the procedure half an hour after birth. Jessica has spent her whole life in hospital, but today left the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for the first time with her delighted parents Claire and Dom, so they can enjoy the festive season at home. Five-month-old Jessica Muse, pictured with parents Claire and Dom, is believed to be the youngest ever person to undergo open heart surgery, just 30 minutes after she was born . Jessica was born hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side of her heart was severely underdeveloped and did not work. The life-threatening condition was detected during Mrs Muse's 20-week scan and doctors also discovered she had an 'intact septum' meaning the top two chambers of her heart were fully closed.Without surgery, Jessica would not survive after birth. When she was born weighing 7lbs 5oz on July 16th this year by Caesarean section, Mrs Muse, 31, and husband Dom, 29, a process operator at a factory, only managed to get a quick glimpse of their daughter before she was whisked away immediately for surgery. Jessica was born hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side was severely underdeveloped and did not work . Dr Asif Hasan performed the delicate operation on Jessica, whose heart was the size of a walnut, in an open heart procedure known as an atrial septostomy. The top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open and operation enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven-hour long open heart procedure at ten days old. At one point, her parents, who live in Newcastle, were told their daughter's chances of survival were 'very small' and feared she might not make it. But after nine operations in total, including the two open heart surgeries, Jessica is battling back and is getting used to life at home. Mrs Muse, a computer technician at Northumbria University, said: 'After Jessica was born, I literally heard her cry and she was whisked away to be operated on. Now, after nine operations, including the two open heart surgeries, Jessica is getting used to life at home . 'I just wanted to grab hold of her and keep her safe but I knew that she urgently needed the surgery. 'We've been told she's probably the youngest ever to have open heart surgery. 'Without the staff and surgeons at the hospital, Jessica wouldn't be here today. We can't thank them enough, they are brilliant. 'It's her first Christmas and it's so special. We didn't know if she'd even be here at this point. 'We didn't know whether to buy many presents at first because we weren't sure if she'd get to come home, but Jessica has a lot of gifts now, from us and friends. 'We managed to get the Christmas tree up for her too so we're really looking forward to it. 'Looking at her now, it's hard to believe that she's been through so much and we are so grateful to the Children's Heart Unit Fund at the Freeman.' During surgery, the top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open. This enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven-hour long open heart procedure at ten days old . Jessica will also need a heart transplant when she is ten . Mrs Muse was unable to be by her daughter's side immediately after the birth because the Freeman does not have a maternity unit and spent an agonising night at the Royal Victoria Infirmary awaiting news about whether the operation had been a success. She said: 'It was very scary not being there with her or knowing what was going on. 'Although we knew from a very early stage in my pregnancy that Jessica would be poorly, we didn't know exactly what would be wrong with her. 'Normally babies have surgery where a balloon is inserted through the veins and it opens up the heart, but Jessica had to have open heart surgery. 'The doctors couldn't tell us what would happen because it all depended on how she reacted and if she could cope, but the surgeon let me know as soon as possible that Jessica had made it.' Following the second surgery, Jessica's sternum was left open and covered with a plastic film and it was eventually closed when she was three and a half weeks old. She also met a special visitor during her final few days at the Freeman . Hospital. Ex-Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer has recently become patron of the Children's Heart Unit Fund charity . Her mother added: 'You could see her little heart beating underneath the film which was a little scary, but she needed it to survive.' After the second operation, Jessica was also diagnosed with pulmonary lymphangiectasia, a lung condition which was caused due to her underdeveloped heart. She had her last operation, a tracheostomy, at six weeks and one day old, to help her breathe. Jessica faces two more operations - one at the end of January and another aged four to allow her heart to function properly. Eventually she will need a heart transplant, at around the age of ten. Jessica also had a special visitor during her final few days at the Freeman Hosptal, ex-Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who this week took on the role of patron of the Children's Heart Unit Fund charity. Mrs Muse said: 'She had her picture taken with Shearer holding her when he came to visit the hospital.'Dom says he's going to get the picture framed with a caption underneath it saying: \"One legend meets another\".'"}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Maybe it was just a case of delaying the inevitable during Monday's 66th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony. Having showered an array of major nominations on cable, Netflix and movie stars while seeming to further diminish the so-called \"Big Four\" broadcast networks, Emmy voters in a sense recanted on the big night. Eleven of the 25 trophies -- an unusually high percentage these days -- went to traditional over-the-air networks, while Netflix and the marquee movie stars got shut out. As they've tended to do in the past, voters instead rinsed and repeated by rewarding previous winners. The six main categories are instructive. AMC's \"Breaking Bad\" defended last year's championship in the Best Drama Series as it knocked off HBO's much-heralded \"True Detective,\" which won just one Emmy all night. In the Best Comedy Series, ABC's \"Modern Family\" prevailed for the fifth year in a row, tying the record set by NBC's \"Frasier.\" Netflix's drama-fueled \"Orange is the New Black,\" which entered itself in this category, did go to jail but did not collect any Emmys. Julianna Margulies added to the broadcast network glow by winning a second Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmy, this time for her role in CBS' \"The Good Wife.\" For the first time at any of this year's major awards ceremonies, Matthew McConaughey came away empty-handed in the Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his showy role in HBO's \"True Detective.\" Bryan Cranston out dueled him and won his fourth Emmy for \"Breaking Bad.\" It was Julia Louis-Dreyfus' night once more in winning Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She won her third Emmy for HBO's \"Veep,\" and now is the only actress to take home the lead prize in three comedy series -- including NBC's \"Seinfeld\" and CBS' \"The New Adventures of Old Christine.\" CBS and Jim Parsons combined again in the Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category. Parsons has now won four Emmys for \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which is still television's runaway most popular comedy series on all \"platforms.\" For those of you keeping score, half of these marquee Emmys went to the traditional broadcast networks and each winner was a repeater. In what seem like prehistoric times, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox used to dominate \"television's biggest night\" before flaunting their Emmy wins as promotional springboards for the new fall season. NBC famously inserted commercials within the 1981 primetime ceremony touting the mounting number of Emmy wins for its then ratings-starved first-year series, \"Hill Street Blues.\" The classic cop drama ended up winning six of NBC's eight Emmys on that night. And in its second season, \"Hill Street\" vaulted from nearly dead last to a top 30 finish in the yearly primetime Nielsen ratings. Cable networks, led by HBO, began flexing muscles in the 1990s, though. Series such as \"The Sopranos\" and \"Sex and the City\" became Emmy darlings while HBO's movies were perennial winners. At last year's major Emmy ceremony, HBO led all networks with seven wins, as other cable networks and Netflix combined for another 12 statues. That left the broadcast networks with just six wins out of the 25 major Emmys awarded. Whether it carries over or not -- and chances are it won't -- Monday night's 11 broadcast network wins are an overall morale boost compared with recent outcomes. Also left at Emmy's altar Monday night was movie star Billy Bob Thornton, an early favorite for his villainous lead role in FX's \"Fargo.\" But the \"Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie\" Emmy went to Benedict Cumberbatch for his title role in PBS' \"Sherlock: His Last Vow.\" Emmy host Seth Meyers had measured the traditional broadcast networks for a coffin early in his opening monologue. \"MTV still has an award for music videos even though they no longer show music videos,\" he joked. \"That's like network TV holding an awards show and giving all the trophies to cable and Netflix. That would be crazy. Why would they do that?\" Meyers could have been speaking for host network NBC, which was shut out Monday night along with Fox. But old-liner CBS ended up in a three-way tie for the most Emmys, at five, with cable's AMC and FX. HBO, accustomed to walking away as Emmy's top dog, won just three Emmys to tie it with broadcasters ABC and PBS. The Netflix shutout, following nominations in five of the six marquee categories, may be a message that Emmy voters are not yet ready to swoon over the \"world's leading television Internet provider,\" as it bills itself. Netflix still keeps its audience numbers secret for its streaming original series and also may have riled some voters by submitting \"Orange is the New Black\" as a comedy in what looked like a craven grab for Emmy gold. Indeed, Meyers basked in sustained applause and cheers when he cracked, \"We had comedies that made you laugh and comedies that made you cry because they were dramas submitted as comedies.\" In this Emmy year at least, the broadcast network contingent has something to cheer about, too. It might well be a last stand, with an increasing number of cable networks making original and praiseworthy drama or comedy series. But for one shining night, broadcasters CBS, ABC and PBS can all say they matched or exceeded HBO. These days that's no small feat."}]}

Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter and get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour under an Ofsted shake-up. They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students. Ofsted insists that from \u2018day one\u2019, trainees and freshly qualified teachers should act and dress in a way that befits their position. Crackdown: Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter under an Ofsted shake-up. They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students . The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which the watchdog believes are not adequately preparing new recruits for the rigours of the classroom. Ofsted yesterday launched a consultation on a revised framework for inspecting initial teacher education (ITE), which will be implemented in June. This places a greater emphasis on trainees\u2019 handling of pupil misbehaviour and the standard of their \u2018professional dress and conduct\u2019. Inspectors will judge the quality of their training in how to instil discipline and cope with bad behaviour. Concern: Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warns that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared . Specific attention will be paid to how well trainees \u2018manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment\u2019. Inspection frameworks will be changed to ensure that inspectors can \u2018directly observe how well trainees teach nearer the end of their training\u2019. They will also return to assess newly qualified teachers (NQTs) in the first term of their employment as part of a two-stage inspection process. At present Ofsted does a single visit - observing the teaching of trainees and former trainees based in the same schools or colleges. Referring to the shake-up, the consultation document says: \u2018We believe that this will allow a sharper focus on trainees\u2019 outcomes and how well they are prepared for teaching and the rigours of the classroom.\u2019 In a speech to the North of England education conference in January, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warned that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared. He said: \u2018How many times have I heard that trainees are being sent into schools without proper guidance on professional behaviour or dress?\u2019 \u2018How many times have I heard that trainees have been inadequately prepared to deal with poor behaviour?\u2019 Sir Michael said that if trainee teachers are struggling in the classroom, the college where they trained should share some of the responsibility. He added: \u2018Ofsted has not been as demanding as it should have been with training providers who have sent newly qualified teachers out into schools unprepared for the rigours of the classroom. \u2018In my view, there is no such thing as a bad NQT (newly qualified teacher), just one that is badly trained, poorly accredited and badly supported.\u2019 Sean Harford, Ofsted national director of Initial Teacher Training, said yesterday: \u2018Parents know that it is really important that trainee teachers get the best quality training before they face a classroom of pupils or students. Discipline: New teaching recruits will also be forced to get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour. The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which Ofsted believes are not adequately preparing new recruits . \u2018That\u2019s why from June, Ofsted will raise standards for teacher training partnerships to make sure that all new teachers are as ready as they can possibly be to excel in the classroom.\u2019 An Ofsted spokesman added: \u2018We are not being prescriptive about what teachers should and should not wear. \u2018But we are clear that teachers must, on day one, conduct themselves and be dressed in a manner which befits their professional status.\u2019 Ofsted inspects all training which leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for maintained schools and further education teacher training that has been endorsed by higher education institutions.

There has long been a theory that smoking more potent cannabis is actually healthier than puffing on a less powerful joint. The thinking is that when people smoke high-potency cannabis, they compensate for the potency by inhaling less smoke. But now this theory has been partially debunked by researchers. People who smoke high-potency cannabis take in more of the drug's active ingredient, THC . If this was accurate, it would mean they experience the desired high while doing their lungs less damage. However, Dutch research has now revealed this theory is not accurate. The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Addiction, discovered that people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale more of the drug\u2019s active ingredient, THC. They say that while these smokers do reduce the amount of smoke they inhale, they still take in more THC than people who smoke lower potency cannabis. This is because of the higher THC content of high-potency cannabis. As a result of consuming more THC, they are more likely to become addicted to the drug. However, as they inhale less, they do take in a smaller volume of smoke. Despite this, they still inhale harmful smoke. To make up for the additional strength of the drug, people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale less. This means they take in slightly less harmful smoke . To conduct the study, the researchers observed 98 cannabis smokers as they rolled and smoked cannabis of varying concentrations. Those who made strong joints inhaled smaller volumes of smoke, presumably in an attempt to reduce the amount of THC taken into the body. But these efforts were only partially successful, compensating for roughly half of the THC strength. So, although smokers of strong cannabis alter their smoking behaviour to compensate for the higher potency, they don't alter it enough to make smoking high-strength cannabis the healthier option."}]}

Reassurances: Thailand's Deputy PM Chalerm Yubamrung confirmed a man had been arrested on suspicion of a terror plot in Bangkok, but insisted the situation was under control . British tourists were warned today to beware of possible attacks targeting westerners in Thailand after police thwarted a terror plot in Bangkok. The US Embassy revealed a \u2018real and credible\u2019 threat against Americans and western holidaymakers in the Thai capital. The alert \u2013 the first of its kind in Bangkok in recent memory \u2013 followed the arrest of a Lebanese man with suspected links to Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. He was seized following a tip-off that helped foil a planned attack on New Year\u2019s Eve. A second plotter was still at large last night. US officials urged Americans to \u2018keep a low profile\u2019 in public and to exercise caution in areas where western tourists gather. \u2018Foreign terrorists may be currently looking to conduct attacks against tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future,\u2019 they added. The warning in Bangkok comes at a time of heightened tension between the West and Iran over Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Thousands of mourners chanted anti-US and Israeli slogans at the funeral in Tehran yesterday of slain nuclear expert Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Wednesday\u2019s motorcycle bombing a \u2018cowardly assassination\u2019 and accused the US and Israel of being behind the attack. On alert: The foiled plot comes at a time of heightened tensions between the West and Iran over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, particularly after the bombing (above) of a Iranian nuclear scientist in the capital on Wednesday . American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied the US played any role in the bombing. Thailand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yubamrung said Israelis were thought to be the targets of the New Year\u2019s Eve terror plot in Bangkok. \u2018At first, we were told the Palestinians were behind it, but it turned out to be Hezbollah,\u2019 he said. He said two men were arrested on Thursday. Face-off: Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (left) blames the U.S. and Israel for the nuclear scientist's death, a charge U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (right) denies . \u2018The authorities had been following two Lebanese men and called in one of them for questioning,\u2019 he said. \u2018Technically the two men have not committed any crimes under Thai law so we could only use the immigration law to keep this one suspect in custody,\u2019 he added. Despite the US warning, he insisted the danger had passed: \u2018I want to confirm and I am confident that we have the situation under control. 'And I can guarantee no terrorist attacks will be allowed to take place. If they have disagreement, they should go fight somewhere else.\u2019 Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, is the most potent military force in Lebanon, far stronger than even the national army.

Clinton, the current secretary of state, will be accompanied Tuesday by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, an aide told CNN. Reagan also will attend the California service at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, a Reagan Foundation official said. Former President George W.

Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, will attend the Michigan funeral, the spokesman said. Following the Tuesday service, Ford's remains will lie in repose at the church until midnight, then be flown on Wednesday to Michigan to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, according to a website on the memorial plans. Ford's remains will then lie in repose there beginning at 7 p.m. local time, said a statement posted on the website. On Thursday, Ford's private funeral will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, the statement on the website said. Ford, who died Friday at age 93, raised awareness of issues involving women's rights, cancer, alcoholism and substance abuse during and after her stint as first lady. Her late husband, former President Gerald Ford, died in 2006. The alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Rancho Mirage, California, that bears her name has become one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the country. In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton said she was \"grateful for having known\" Ford. \"Her commitment to speaking out on issues that, before she took them on, were just not discussed made a huge difference in the lives of Americans,\" Clinton said. \"I remember well when my mother's best friend was dying of breast cancer, nobody talked about it in those days,\" Clinton continued. \"But Betty Ford made it acceptable\" to discuss the issue in public. Also planning to be in California for the Tuesday service are protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church of Kansas, which cited on its website what it called Ford's infidelity by divorcing a first husband to marry Gerald Ford. The church is known for publicity seeking protests at funerals of U.S. soldiers and others to promote its radical conservative Christian agenda.

A new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol, raising hopes of a fresh option for people who can't tolerate or don't get enough help from Lipitor and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades. The first large studies of these drugs were presented Saturday at an American College of Cardiology conference in Washington, and more will follow on Sunday. Several companies are developing these drugs, which are aimed at 70 million Americans and millions more worldwide who have high LDL or 'bad' cholesterol, a major risk for heart disease. A new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol, raising hopes of a fresh option for people who can't tolerate or don't get enough help from Lipitor and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades. The first large studies of these drugs were presented Saturday at an American College of Cardiology conference in Washington . Three studies of Amgen Inc.'s version of these drugs, called evolocumab (ev-oh-LOKE-you-mab), found it lowered LDL or 'bad' cholesterol by 55 to 66 percent compared to a fake drug, and by nearly that much when compared to Merck's Zetia, another cholesterol medication. As impressive as that is, it's still just part of the picture. Doctors want evidence that the way these drugs lower cholesterol also will lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths, because that proof already exists for statins. New studies are underway to test this, but Amgen said it will seek approval for its drug this year based on cholesterol-lowering alone. That was enough to win approval for statins and Zetia, but use of Zetia has declined since 2008, when research showed it failed to help prevent heart attacks even though it cut cholesterol. Hopes are high that the new Amgen drug and others like it will do better. 'I would be happy to see it approved on the cholesterol results alone,' said Dr. Hadley Wilson, a cardiologist at Carolinas HealthCare System. 'We need additional agents other than statins\" to help patients,' he said. Nearly all current cholesterol medicines \u2014 fibrates, niacin and top-selling statins \u2014 are decades old. Statins such as Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor curb cholesterol production. Zetia, which came out about a decade ago, helps block the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. The new drugs block PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. They have big drawbacks, though. Statins are pills sold as generics for as little as a dime a day. The new drugs are proteins rather than chemicals, and those tend to be very expensive to make. They also must be given as shots every two weeks or once a month. People can give the shots to themselves with a pen-like device. The companies developing the new medicines have not said what they might cost. 'We were very, very pleased about how well patients accepted the shots, and if they offer better results, especially for those with inherited conditions - people will accept it,' said Dr. Michael Koren of Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida, who helped lead two of the studies. The three Amgen studies involved about 2,000 patients in all. Doctors tested the drug in people with high cholesterol not taking other medicines, as a long-term (one-year) treatment in people already taking various medications and in combination with statins and other drugs in people with an inherited cholesterol disorder. In general, side-effect rates were about the same for evolocumab vs. placebo or Zetia. In some studies, muscle aches, nausea and a few other problems were a little higher with the experimental drug. Overall safety 'is very, very encouraging,' said Dr. Scott Wasserman, Amgen's executive medical director. Researchers also said: . \u2014Alirocumab, a similar drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., lowered LDL cholesterol by 47 percent vs. 16 percent for Zetia in a study of about 100 people not taking any other drugs for high cholesterol. \u2014Bococizumab, from Pfizer Inc., lowered LDL 45 percent to 67 percent, depending on dose, compared to placebo in 354 people with high cholesterol also taking a statin. 'There's great interest in all of these drugs, but doctors will wait for evidence that they lower heart risks,' said Dr. Neil Stone, a Northwestern University cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association. It may be easier to justify their use in patients with genes that cause high cholesterol at an early age, he said. A spokeswoman for the federal Food and Drug Administration, Sandy Walsh, suggested that might be the case. 'Although we cannot comment on the likelihood of approval based solely on specific indications or populations,' two drugs recently were approved based on cholesterol-lowering for people with inherited conditions,' she noted. A decision on approval also will be influenced by how much the drug lowers cholesterol, its effects on other fats in the blood and other heart signs such as inflammation and blood pressure, and its safety, she said."}]}

All previous attempts to eliminate the mention of God in the pledge recited in classrooms across the country have failed, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered arguments seeking removal of the reference based on discrimination. The case was brought by an unidentified family of a student at a school in suburban Boston, whose lawyers argued that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the state Constitution. It was the first such case at the state level. Roy Speckhardt, the executive director of the American Humanist Association, an atheist group that provided legal services for the plaintiffs, called the decision a setback. But he said the group felt confident about a similar case filed in New Jersey last week that  seeks to show that the pledge engendered a climate of discrimination. In its ruling, the Massachusetts court said the pledge was voluntary and a \"fundamentally patriotic exercise, not a religious one.\" The decision said the plaintiffs failed to prove that reciting the pledge resulted in negative treatment. \"The plaintiffs here did not successfully allege that their children receive negative treatment because they opt not to recite the words 'under God,' or that the inclusion of that phrase in the pledge has occasioned 'the creation of second-class citizens,' \" the decision said. But the ruling said that \"should future plaintiffs demonstrate that the distinction created by the pledge as currently written has engendered bullying or differential treatment,\" the court \"would leave open the possibility that the equal rights amendment might provide a remedy.\" Speckhardt said that the recitation of the pledge resulted in some children being \"ostracized\" for being atheists and that the government was complicit in bullying and prejudice against those children. In 1954, Congress amended the pledge to include the words \"under God\" during the escalation of the Cold War. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has high-profile and precedent-setting experience deciding cases hinging on the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution. In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage with the Supreme Judicial Court's landmark Goodridge decision."}]}

Expensive: A Gucci bag similar to the luxury model that was bought with the stolen cash, a London court heard . And that when they were discovered some of them remained unused and in their original packaging. Beg, 26, forged the cheques over a nine month period while she worked for welfare-to-work provider Ingeus UK Ltd. Prosecutor Karen Maxwell-Burnside said Beg ripped off her employers between February and October 2009. She told the court the treasury assistant faked a spinal tumour and regularly feigned illness to take time off. The court also heard that in the days after she cashed a forged cheque she would go shopping. Beg was eventually caught when an investigation was launched into her repeated absences and she was unable to explain and back up her reasons for taking time off. Coveted: Handbags by Louis Vuitton, like this one, were found unused after Beg's shopping spree, Snaresbrook court heard . Prized: Luxury brands like this Hermes were targeted by Beg the court in London heard . She later complained that she had been bullied at work and passed over for promotion. Ms Maxwell-Burnside added: 'The timing of the cashing of the cheques seemed to correspond with the times she was on sick leave. 'It seems she would go and get the money when she was not working. 'Although she took time off work she would return for the odd day to complete the monthly reconciliation forms in an effort to ensure her fraud was not discovered. 'In total Beg, who was earning \u00a31,700 per month, stole \u00a371,350 and bought 22 handbags as well as a laptop computer. But many of the bags were recovered from Beg's home in Walthamstow, east London, unused and still in their original packaging. Ms Maxwell-Burnside said: 'Miss Beg told officers she had been bullied at work. 'She also felt that she had been passed over by less well qualified colleagues on the basis of their dress and their manner.' The court heard that since her arrest Beg had been diagnosed with Bipolar affective disorder and was receiving treatment for the condition. Caroline Jackson, defending Beg, told the court: 'It is not being put forward that she was so unwell that she did not know what she was doing. 'Though, to have some 22 designer handbags at home seems quite odd behaviour.' Sentencing Beg Judge Nicholas Huskinson said: 'This was a very serious offence involving a breach of trust, especially having regards to your position of responsibility. 'It was carried out over a substantial period of time and indeed the last cheque was drawn after you had already been suspended. 'The deviousness with which you operated can be noted in that not only did you forge the cheques but you took substantial sick leave for which your company was receptive and generous to but you came in on the day of reconciliation in order to cover your tracks and that in my judgement shows a degree of calculation. 'Beg, of Walthamstow, admitted one charge of fraud and was jailed for 16 months."}]}

Castleford ensured the battle for the League Leaders' Shield will go down to the final round of fixtures after beating Wakefield 26-22 in a rousing derby at the Mend-a-Hose Jungle. The Tigers' hard-fought victory means they will finish top of the table for the first time in the club's history if current leaders St Helens lose at Huddersfield and they beat Catalan Dragons in Perpignan next weekend. Delight: Castleford have kept themselves in contention for the League Leaders Shield with their Derby win . Castleford could do no wrong for the first half-hour as they stormed into a 22-0 lead but veteran forward Ali Lauitiiti inspired a remarkable fightback for the visitors. Three-quarters Lee Gilmour and Richard Owen, both playing on loan from Castleford, scored tries against their parent club to help set up a tense finish before the Tigers were able to finally complete a third win of the season over their near neighbours. Wakefield created the first scoring opportunity when full-back Paul Sykes burst clear with stand-off Pita Godinet on his inside but the final pass went astray and the Tigers proceeded to give them a lesson in finishing. Sykes brought second rower Oliver Holmes short of the line but the Wildcats could not regroup in time to prevent full-back Luke Dorn slicing through for the opening in the next play. Loose forward Nathan Massey was then held up over the line before left winger James Clare produced two excellent finishes to score two tries in 15 minutes. Exciting hooker Daryl Clark was the provider on both occasions, the first from a trademark surge following a quickly taken re-start and the second with a superb cut-out pass. Close Competition: St Helens still remain the favourites and have a firm grip on the lead ahead of Castleford . Clare, deputising for injured Australian Justin Carney, took both his chances magnificently while right winger Kirk Dixon also came up with a devastating finish on 32 minutes, taking Clark's pass to go round Chris Riley for his side's fourth try. Marc Sneyd's third goal made it 22-0 but the Tigers became over-confident and when they knocked on from the first tackle on their own 20-metre line they were punished, with Lauitiiti sending Gilmour over for Wakefield's first try. Sykes added the conversion, to register the 500th goal of his career, and Wakefield scored again three minutes before half-time when Dixon fumbled Tim Smith's high kick to gift a try to Riley. Wakefield had the momentum at that stage and centre Reece Lyne touched down two minutes into the second half only to discover he had put a foot in touch and Castleford managed to regain control of the game. However, the action continued as both sets of players produced a series of crunching hits which provided great entertainment for the bumper derby crowd of 9,182. Castleford prop Garreth Carvell had to be placed on a stretcher after being flattened by a tackle from Wakefield substitute Chris Annakin as both teams demonstrated full commitment to the end. When Riley failed to clear the danger caused by Sneyd's kick and centre Jake Webster swooped for Castleford's fifth try on 67 minutes, the game looked to be over as a contest. However, the Wildcats set up a dramatic finale by scoring two tries in the last 10 minutes, both converted by Sykes and the home side were hanging on at the end. Australian prop Scott Anderson pounced on a loose ball to register the first try of his career and Owen dived over at the corner with seven minutes remaining."}]}

Photographs taken by investigators of Portway's Worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase leading to a hidden basement room containing a 'child-sized homemade coffin,' a steel cage, handcuffs and a set of butcher's knives. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Pictures of the stomach-turning torture chamber where British-born Massachusetts resident Geoffrey Portway planned to rape, murder then eat children show a makeshift coffin and a cage, left . Coffin: The homemade child-size box, pictured, was soundproofed . Evidence: Investigators also found handcuffs, pictured, in the horror basement torture chamber . 'Portway has pled guilty to some of . the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society, namely . participating in the sexual exploitation of young children through the . possession and distribution of child pornography and soliciting the . kidnapping of a child for the purpose of killing and consuming that . child,' federal prosecutors wrote in court documents, obtained by the Boston Herald. Guilty: Portway, 40, was sentenced to 27 years on Tuesday in Worcester, Massachusetts . The . sentencing papers, filed yesterday, include frightening excerpts from . online chats Portway had with like-minded child pornographers and . potential killers, including Florida puppeteer Ronald Brown who planned . to kidnap children he knew through his local church. According . to the Herald, Brown went as far as to send Portway a photograph of a . young boy 'with lines drawn on him to identify the different cuts of . meat.' The two chatted . about kidnapping the boy, taking him to a rented house and eating him . over several weeks before feeding the 'leftovers' to alligators. Brown . has since been convicted. In . May, Portway pleaded guilty to solicitation to kidnap a child and to . distribution and possession of child pornography. As a British national, . he will likely be deported after serving his sentence. Portway had numerous chats with . individuals about a 'mutual interest in abducting, raping, murdering, . and eating children,' an agreed statement of facts released by the U.S. attorney in Boston in May stated. In . July last year, federal agents searching Portway's residence in . Worcester discovered the terrifying locked dungeon in the basement of . his home. It contained a chair, television, and what appeared to be cable access to the Internet. The . room also contained the child-sized homemade coffin that had large . speakers covering wire mesh at one end and an exterior locking devices. Strange: Police found various other items including a child's jumpsuit, pictured, in the basement . Locks: The box had straps, pictured, which Portway intended to use to restrain his victim . They also found a steel cage . approximately 3' wide, 2'high and 4' long with multiple locking devices, . and a steel table top with steel rings at six points, presumably for . restraints. Outside was a cabinet freezer, an upright freezer, disposable scalpels, butchering kits, and castration tools. This . dungeon was described in detail by Portway in recovered chats as a . place he intended to use to keep kidnapped children while he sexually . abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the . children. Many of these conversations were accompanied by the trading of child pornography. These . chats also included images of children known to them, accompanied by . discussions of desire to sexually abuse, murder and cannibalize those . children. Stairs: Photographs taken by investigators of Portway's Worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase, pictured, leading down to a hidden basement dungeon . Knives: Police also found a 'delux butcher set,' pictured, in Portway's home . Disturbing: Books and DVDs on cannibalism, pictured, were discovered in Portway's home . Bleach: Investigators also found a bottle of bleach in the dungeon . As stated both in court filings from . May, through his online chats, Portway solicited several people for . their help in abducting a child, including Brown and another man called Michael Arnett of Kansas. At . least as early as 2010, Portway utilized Skype and other programs to . communicate with Arnett, trading child pornography including images of . injured, mutilated and deceased children while chatting about the sexual . abuse, rape, abduction, murder, and cannibalism of children. Over . months, Portway repeatedly solicited Arnett to kidnap a child for him, . with the intent that Portway would ultimately rape, kill and eat that . child. These solicitations . for help in abducting a child included discussing real children, by name . and photo, that Arnett claimed to know and have access. Rope: Other equipment found included 'Japanese Silk Love Rope' Cage: The cage had a small mattress in it and multiple locks . Sick: Portway's DVD collection contained much inspiration for the gruesome things he planned to carry out . In the chats, . Portway and Arnett discuss different ways to kidnap children and the age . range that Portway prefers. During the time that Portway was soliciting Arnett, Portway had been told that Arnett had helped others with such requests before and that . Arnett had experience with the abduction and sexual abuse of children. Arnett has since pleaded guilty in Kansas to the sexual exploitation of a child for the purposes of producing child pornography. A forensic examination of the computers uncovered evidence of over 4,500 trades of child pornography between Portway and others. Many of these trades involved Portway distributing child pornography to others based on their stated specific preferences, including images and videos appearing to depict dead children and the cannibalism of children. House of horror: Tucked in the basement of a Beechmont Street, Worcester, MA home federal authorities found a dungeon containing a child-sized homemade coffin, a steel cage, torture devices and butchering tools . Agreement: Geoffrey Portway, a UK citizen born in Spain and living in Worcester, Massachusetts had solicited a Kansas man, Michael Arnett (pictured), to kidnap a child whom Portway 'would ultimately rape, kill and eat.' Filthy: The apartment including the sink, pictured,was filthy when police raided it . Sturdy: The lid of the cage is extremely sturdy with multiple locks .

'Even though criminals attempt to hide in the anonymity provided by the Internet, the Department of Justice is committed to aggressively pursuing them to ensure that there is no place to hide.' 'An investigation that began in Milford in 2010 \u2014 expanded to Europe and beyond \u2014has returned back to where it originally started: the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,' said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigation in Boston. Locked: The door to the basement, pictured, had a sturdy lock . Meat: Bags of meat, pictured, were found in the man's freezer though none of it was human . Freezer: Portway talked of chopping up little boys, freezing the parts in his freezer, pictured, and eating them over several weeks . 'Since we began this operation \u2014Operation Holitna \u2014 a worldwide network of offenders has been, and continues to be,unraveled, including Portway.' Foucart added,'Thanks to the determination of HSI, along with our partners at the U.S. attorney's office, we have been able to rescue 160 children and arrest 51 perpetrators worldwide. This was all\u00a0 as a result of the arrest of a Milford man, and subsequent advanced forensics of his digital media. 'Portway's guilty plea should serve as a stern warning to those inclined to abuse children or share images of child pornography: there isn't a place in the United States, on the Internet, or the planet in which you are truly safe. We will investigate you, we will prosecute you and we will bring you to justice.' Sinister: The dungeon, pictured, was discovered after police noticed Portway chatting online about the planned crimes and sharing child porn .

A minister yesterday admitted that the plan to serve free hot meals to all young children in primary schools from September was going to fail. David Laws, the Liberal Democrat second-in-command at the Department for Education, said some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot. He admitted not everything would be \u2018perfect on day one\u2019 as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg\u2019s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September. David Laws admitted not everything would be 'perfect on day one' as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg\u00bfs flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September . It suggests some schools will take weeks or months, if not longer, to offer all eligible pupils hot meals. Mr Laws also disclosed that extra funding to help small schools implement the policy may need to continue for \u2018years\u2019. The Mail disclosed this week that tens of thousands of pupils will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches from September because schools lack proper kitchens and cannot afford them. More than 3,000 primaries \u2013 about one in five \u2013 will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens. Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils\u2019 desks. But many of these are unlikely to meet rules on\u00a0 nutritional content that schools must follow. Mr Law\u2019s comments, in a speech to school caterers in Birmingham yesterday, represented the first time that the Government had admitted the scale of the problem. David Laws said that some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot . He said: \u2018Some schools will provide a cold meal initially, until capital works are complete. In the medium term we expect all schools to be giving a hot food option \u2013 which is what is really necessary to meet the school food standards consistently.\u2019 The Liberal Democrats insisted that \u2018medium term\u2019 meant weeks but research for the Mail suggests renovation works at some schools will take considerably longer. Mr Laws also said that many schools were \u2018raising their sights\u2019 above transporting in pre-prepared meals and wanted their\u00a0 own kitchens. He said the Government intended to consider what it could do to \u2018support schools further in creating the right facilities and environment to maximise the quality of food\u2019. But he added: \u2018It would be unrealistic to think that in just one year we could rebuild the entire school estate and reverse decades of neglect in some areas.\u2019 And he insisted: \u2018I was not willing to allow the search for perfection to get in the way of delivering a step change in healthy eating which is needed right now.\u2019 Mr Clegg used his speech to last year\u2019s Liberal Democrat conference to demand a \u2018hot, healthy lunch\u2019 for infant school pupils every day. Following warnings from head teachers, references to \u2018hot\u2019 were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year, which simply requires that food\u00a0 be \u2018nutritious\u2019. The policy has provoked one of the fiercest bouts of in-fighting within the Coalition since power-sharing began in 2010.

A million chickens infected with bird flu have been killed and disposed of by Mexican authorities. The virus was found in 18 farms in Guanjuato, a state in the centre of the country, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Officials say the virus, H7N3, does not pose a threat to humans. A spokesman said: 'This virus is exclusive to birds, so there is no risk for public safety.' Slaughter: Between a million and two million chicken have been culled in Mexico after contracting bird flu . Nearly two million birds have been vaccinated, with plans for millions more in the coming months. CNN reported that authorities reported different numbers of how many infected birds had been slaughtered. Earlier this week Agriculture Minister Enrique Martinez said that more than 2.1million chickens had been killed, including 519,000 egg-producing chickens, 722,265 breeding chickens and 900,000 chickens raised for meat. Authorities say the strain is not one that affects humans and say the situation is under control . However, Javier Usabiaga Arroyo, a state agriculture official, later said the total number was about 1.2million, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Officials have vaccinated 1.9million birds since the outbreak began earlier this month, and they plan to vaccinate millions more. The Government also attempted to allay fears about food prices spiking, saying the number is a fraction of the overall chicken population. 'The outbreak of avian influenza is controlled,' Mexico's food safety agency said in a statement. Other strains of bird flu have spread to humans, sparking mass culls. In January 1998, authorities in Hong Kong ordered all chickens for sale in markets to be destroyed after the H5N1 strand infected 18 people, killing six. Later that year a major outbreak of the H5N1 virus in West Bengal, India lead to the culling of 2.6 million birds. In 2006 there were 65 outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide, killing a total of 115 people - the highest number to die from the disease in a single year. A new strain of avian flu, H3N8, . killed 162 harbor seals in New England after jumping from birds to . humans in July last year.

UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 27 May 2013 . MI5 faces growing questions over the Woolwich murderers after it emerged that Michael Adebolajo was left free to return to Kenya despite the fact the country had deported him as a terrorist. Adebolajo, seen wielding a knife with his hands covered in blood after the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, was booted out of the African country in 2010 after he was caught attempting to enter Somalia to fight with extremists. Kenya warned Britain that he was a \u2018dangerous radical\u2019 intent on waging war on the West \u2013 but he was free to return at least once last year to meet with fellow jihadists, the Daily Mail understands. Radicalised: Michael Adebolajo brandishing bloodied knives after the murder of Lee Rigby last week . Arrested: In 2010 Michael Adebolajo, second from right, was among nine suspected members of the Al-Shabaab movement captured by Kenyan police . Sources in Africa say the 28-year-old was seen in Kenya as late as last November, in the company of a radical cleric who was also being monitored by security forces. Adebolajo is also suspected of making a third visit to the country, which has become a gateway for young radicalised Britons wishing to fight alongside jihadists in Somalia. The British police and security services now face questions over why they did not do more to stop Adebolajo and his accomplice, Michael Adebowale. Despite a string of warning signs stretching back ten years, Adebolajo is said to have been considered to be \u2018low-risk\u2019 by MI5. Police may have known about his extreme beliefs as early as 2003, when he joined Al-Mahajiroun, an extremist group which was monitored by the security service and later banned. Known to police: Adebolajo was part of a mob that attacked an EDL March in Harrow in 2009 . From yesterday's Daily Mail . He was photographed at high-profile protests \u2013 even standing next to hate preacher Anjem Choudary \u2013 and was arrested in 2006 after an ugly scuffle at the Old Bailey.Seven years later, the Kenyan authorities returned Adebolajo to Britain, warning that he was a dangerous terrorist intent on waging war. Sources in the Kenyan capital Nairobi claim Adebolajo may have gone on to enter Kenya on two occasions in 2012 using false passports. It is claimed that he was arrested with five others last February, as he tried to reach Somalia once again. Instead of being taken to court, he would have been put straight on a flight to the UK, under a new policy which sees all foreigners attempting to cross the border removed from Kenya. A second claim is that Adebolajo entered Kenya even later, again using a false passport, to meet with a cleric named Hassan Makbul. The pair are understood to have realised their cover had been blown, and fled to Tanzania in November. The Mail understands the security forces were aware Adebolajo had left for Africa on at least one occasion, and may have allowed the journey to monitor who he would meet. MI5 chief Andrew Parker is set to present a report to a Parliamentary committee on the case this week. Kenya claims the British security services \u2018ignored\u2019 warnings about Adebolajo. An immigration official said: \u2018This man had a mission to complete so we work on the assumption that he would have come back.\u2019 Court documents seen by the Daily Mail reveal how determined Adebolajo\u2019s gang were to join the Al Qaeda linked al-Shaabab in 2010. When they were arrested police also found al-Shaabab flags and uniforms. The Kenyans also discovered Adebolajo had been radicalised by Sheikh Aboud Rogo, a cleric who was also close to Samantha Lewthwaite, the \u2018white widow\u2019 of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay.

It wasn't true -- the 1967 album sold more than 50,000 copies in its first two years of release -- but the influence of the album is inescapable. The Velvets were precursors to punk rock, art rock, avant-garde rock, almost any kind of rock that veered from the status quo. And, not to discount the contributions of John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and the soon-to-depart Nico, but the voice of the band was Lou Reed. The singer, guitarist and songwriter died Sunday, according to his publicist. He had undergone a liver transplant in May. The Velvet Underground brought a thrilling dose of downtown noise and crudeness to a rock scene that was beginning to take its love-and-peace feelings all too seriously. Reed's songs, such as \"Waiting for the Man\" (whose narrator traveled to Harlem to meet his dealer), \"Venus in Furs\" (about a sadomasochistic relationship) and \"Heroin\" (self-explanatory), were journeys into humanity's dark side. Reed wrote or co-wrote every song on that first album and expanded his songwriting expertise on the VU's later works: the even rawer \"White Light/White Heat\" (1968); the quiet, sometimes brooding, occasionally ecstatic \"The Velvet Underground\" (1969); the pop-directed \"Loaded\" (1970); and the wide-ranging \"lost album\" \"VU,\" which was released in 1985. That was 15 years after the band broke up. The Velvets would later reunite for a 1993 tour and, after guitarist Sterling Morrison's passing, their 1996 introduction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Reed's songs were generally minimalist, sometimes self-consciously poetic, and usually delivered with a deadpan vocal that was all the more haunting, given the songs' subject matter. \"Heroin will be the death of me,\" he sang on \"Heroin,\" and then added, \"It's my wife / and it's my life,\" followed by a chuckle so chilling it sounded like giving up. Combined with the squeal of Cale's viola and the undertow of Tucker's percussion, it was like peering down a dark alley. But Reed was nothing if not a student of pop as well. He'd spent a couple pre-Velvet years slaving away at low-budget Pickwick Records learning the trade, and in his two-, three- and four-chord songs were undergirded with craftsmanship. Four chords may have been a bit much, anyway: \"One chord is fine. Two chords is pushing it. Three chords, and you're into jazz,\" he once said. \"Sunday Morning,\" from the \"Velvet Underground and Nico\" album, contrasted a gorgeous melody with warnings about the past. \"Jesus,\" from \"The Velvet Underground,\" had the purity of a prayer. And then there were \"Loaded's\" \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll,\" which -- in a more just universe -- would have been smash hits: the former a celebration of music, the latter a tribute to rock 'n' radio. His post-Velvets solo career was no less unpredictable. Befriended by David Bowie -- who acknowledged the VU's influence on his soundalike 1971 song \"Queen Bitch\" -- Reed created \"Transformer,\" a 1972 LP that featured his only Top 40 hit, \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" One of the more unlikely hit singles of the pre-MTV era, the song featured unmistakable references to drag queens and oral sex, not to mention a jazzy saxophone solo from Bowie himself (who also produced the record). But Reed would never be pigeonholed. Three years later, he put out \"Metal Machine Music,\" described by \"The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll\" as \"four sides of grating instrumental noise\" and by rock critic (and frequent Reed sparring partner) Lester Bangs as \"the greatest album ever made.\" Bangs was being sarcastic -- mostly -- but even his criticisms highlight the punk pleasure of ticking off authority figures: \"All landlords ... deserve whatever they get, and 'MMM' is the all-time guaranteed lease breaker. Every tenant in America should own a copy of this album,\" he wrote. Outsiders often become insiders, and that was no less true for Reed. By the '80s, indie bands were singling him out as a hero. His poker-faced demeanor became a TV mainstay on Honda scooter commercials. He demanded his MTV. He even got airplay for his new music, such as \"I Love You, Suzanne,\" from his 1984 album \"New Sensations.\" He also showed a more open sense of humor, something that often ran underneath his compositions, even at their bleakest. The humor was most obvious in his occasional acting roles. He played a slick record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 film \"One Trick Pony,\" and a Bob Dylan parody named Auden in the underrated 1983 comedy \"Get Crazy,\" turning idle dialogue (\"It's a deathbed request\") into instant songs. In recent decades, he had settled down with composer Laurie Anderson and become more reflective. With Cale, he paid tribute to Velvet Underground patron Andy Warhol with \"Songs for Drella\" (1990). His 1992 album \"Magic and Loss\" looked at life and aging. It was all part of existence, just like heroin and pale blue eyes and new ages and street hassles. \"I'm a realist. That's why I listen to Lou Reed,\" Bangs wrote in 1980. But for all the darkness and light of his lyrics, the music was often the ticket to raw excitement. That's why, even if all those people didn't form bands like the legend insists, the songs of Lou Reed will always matter. He summed it up in four deceptively simple words from the exuberant \"Rock and Roll.\" \"It was all right,\" he sang. \"It was all right.\" Yes, it is."}]}

She regularly undertook assignments working in PR, journalism and event management as part of her studies at London's College of Fashion. Scroll down for video . Lotte Williams beat 700 entries from other members of the public to win a year-long modelling contract . Lotte looks stunning in her modelling photos, saying she was fed up with the image portrayed by the fashion industry of ultra thin girls . But despite the pressure copy the shapeless models that grace the catwalks of London and Paris Lotte says she was always proud to be different to the other girls. And now she is enjoying life as the new face of fuller figured lingerie firm Curvy Kate after winning their annual 'Star in a Bra' competition. The size 12 redhead - who wears a 30GG bra - has revealed that she was inspired to enter the contest to stand up for fuller-figured ladies. Lotte, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'As part of my course I've been around these size-zero women at London Fashion Week on numerous occasions and I've never thought they really represent real women. 'I thought fuller-figured women such as myself represent the norm much more than the women that grace the catwalks. Lotte felt confident stripping down for the shoot and says working in fashion hasn't dented her confidence . Lotte says that being curvy in the fashion industry encouraged her to develop her own sense of style that flattered her hourglass figure . Lotte works part time in a lingerie shop and has just finished her studies at the London College of Fashion . 'I was fed up by the image that was being portrayed to young girls - that this is the way you should look. 'The likes of Curvy Kate really dispel this myth and there are loads of beautiful curvier women as this year's competition showed. 'I think they are much more representative of the general British public . 'I was just so happy to win it with so much amazing competition. In my eyes this is what women really look like. 'Being part of a world in which size six is the norm has never affected my self confidence but in turn has encouraged me to discover a sense of style that enhances my natural hour glass shape.' Stunning Lotte - who works part-time in a lingerie boutique - beat 700 entries from other members of the public to win the year-long modelling contract earlier this month. She will now grace the pages of Cosmopolitan magazine and the catwalks of Paris working as the new face of the lingerie company. Size 12 Lotte, who wears a 30GG bra, says that her work in the lingerie boutique meant being in skimpy under wear was no problem for her . Lotte, who only finished her Fashion Public Relations course last week, added: 'I'm really looking forward to it - I work part-time in a lingerie boutique so I'm used to seeing lingerie models. 'This meant I was pretty comfortable wearing skimpy underwear and I think this confidence shone across in my pictures. 'But I never dreamed I would end up becoming a lingerie model - it's an amazing feeling. Curvy Kate spokeswoman Hannah Houston said: 'Lotte is a fantastic ambassador for the brand and helps us prove just how good the curvy figure looks in lingerie. Lotte says she was always proud to be different to the other girls . We are thrilled to have her as part of the Curvy Kate family as she is confident, charismatic and embodies our positive body image and diversity message. 'She also champions the fact that curvy is a shape not a size. 'Lotte shone in front of the camera and was so at ease in her lingerie and flaunting her curves.

T.J. Lane was indicted in the shooting deaths of three classmates at Chardon High School. A judge ruled last month that he could be tried as an adult. Lane sat quietly during Friday's brief proceedings, answering a few questions from Geauga County Judge Forrest Burt. Lane's attorneys said they reserved the right to enter a later plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Authorities allege that on February 27, Lane walked up to a table at the high school cafeteria and started firing. \"He was silent the entire time,\" said Nate Mueller, who was a few feet away from the gunman. \"There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire.\" A teacher identified as Frank Hall helped chase the gunman out of the school. Police arrested Lane a short time later.

Days after the attack, prosecutor David Joyce said Lane admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into school that morning and firing 10 rounds, choosing his victims randomly. Joyce said that in the months since the bloodshed, he has met with the families of the victims on a constant basis. \"Their child was murdered,\" he said. \"Justice for them would be to see Mr. Lane detained for an extended period of time.\" Though Lane could be tried as an adult, federal law prohibits capital punishment for anyone under the age of 18. \"Obviously, he can't be put to death as a juvenile, but he can certainly be sentenced to life without parole,\" Joyce said. \"That's up to a jury to decide.\" Lane was indicted on six charges: three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and felonious assault. Burt ordered Lane to a juvenile detention center until June 18, when he will be transferred to the Geauga County Jail."}]}

John Kitzhaber lived on property that was to be used for growing marijuana, and married an illegal immigrant for money during a period in her life when she was \"associating with the wrong kind of people and making mistakes,\" according to a statement she released Tuesday. Cylvia Hayes, 47, admitted to living on a property in Okanogan, Oregon, in 1997 that was supposed to become a marijuana growing operation, but she said it never materialized. \"I am not proud of that brief period of time - I was involved in an abusive relationship with a dangerous man,\" Hayes said. The man who sold the property to Hayes and her boyfriend told CNN affiliate KOIN that the couple stopped making payments. Public records show Hayes gave up her interest in the property in April 1998. Hayes said she did not put any money into the property. \"In the spring of 1998 I began to make plans to get away. In July 1998 I moved to Central Oregon and began building a life and career that I am very proud of,\" Hayes said in a statement. She runs an environmental consulting company. From 1997 until 2002 she was married on paper to an Ethiopian immigrant, a fact she said her husband-to-be didn't know about until it came to light last week. \"This is the most painful part for me,\" Hayes said in a news conference in Portland on Friday confirming the sham marriage. \"John Kitzhaber deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with. The fact that I did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way.\" Fraudulent green card marriages are a federal offense. Hayes said she needed the money at the time, when she was 29. \"The money I had received in July 1997 for entering a fraudulent marriage was used to purchase a laptop and pay school expenses,\" she said. Kitzhaber is running for re-election next month, and addressed his fiancee's actions during a gubernatorial debate Tuesday evening. \"What we know is that 17 years ago, before I know Cylvia and she knew me she was involved in some illegal activity. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did,\" Kitzhaber said. \"The fallout of that set of activities and how we deal with that fallout is really a personal matter between Cylvia and myself.\" Kitzhaber has already served three nonconsecutive terms. The Democrat was first elected in 1994 and remained in office until 2003. In 2010, he was elected to a third term, and he's now seeking a fourth in a race that he has been expected to win. He won his last election with 65% of the vote. While Kitzhaber and Hayes aren't married, they've been a couple for more than a decade and engaged since this summer, according to local news reports. Hayes has been officially referred to as Oregon's first lady during Kitzhaber's latest term."}]}

Follow \"taking the kids\" on www.twitter.com, where Ogintz welcomes your questions and comments. (Tribune Media Services)  -- No one cares that the water is cold. The kids splash at the lake's edge, play on the small sand beach as older, daring ones splash in the water and peddle kayaks, rowboats and paddleboats. Our pup eyes them all curiously. Lake Placid, New York -- home to two Olympics -- is that iconic old-fashioned vacation spot that works as well for 21st-century families -- and their pooches -- as it did a century ago for families and millionaires who came here to the Adirondacks with their family and friends. With 6 million acres, Adirondack State Park is the largest state park in the United States, larger than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier and Grand Canyon national parks combined. It boasts more than 3,000 lakes and 2,000 miles of hiking trails and offers kayaking, canoeing, fishing and mountain biking. (The Whiteface Downhill Mountain Bike Park features 27 downhill and cross-country mountain bike trails that run between the ski trails, through streams and woods.) Lake Placid, a town where everyone seems to be an athlete, or at least an outdoors enthusiast, has only 3,000 residents, but that number swells close to 10,000 in summer. Main Street overlooks Mirror Lake and it's lined with ice cream and coffee shops, all variety of restaurants (sushi, Mexican, steaks, a brewery, even a creperie, some with outdoor patios) and stores selling New York state maple syrup, local chocolate, antique ski posters, local wines and cuddly stuffed moose. Families stroll up and down Main clutching kids' hands, pushing them in strollers, hanging on to dogs, picnicking in front of the lake at the outdoor band shell. (Simply Gourmet is the spot for first-rate sandwiches and cookies for your hikes and picnics.) \"The kids love it because it's so safe we can let them go out on their own,\" said Louise McEachran, here with a group of young freestyle skiers from Ontario who practice their tricks by jumping into an icy pool at the MacKenzie-Intervale Ski Jumping Complex. (You can test your mettle at the Olympic Sports Complex and ride a wheeled bobsled, or check out the view of the Adirondacks from the top of the 26-story Olympic ski jump. Come July 4 and watch the 50th annual ski jump competition. \"Whatever the season there is something for the kids to do,\" adds Suzanne Boger, an attorney from Saratoga Springs, New York, who comes here often -- winter and summer -- with her two kids, husband and two dogs. We meet them hiking and splashing in Lake Placid along the Peninsula Trails that run for miles. Our puppy, Trooper, happily joined in. \"Even when the weather is bad, there are things to do.\" (Bowling anyone?) There's even some Civil War history when you visit Abolitionist John Brown's farm and gravesite. But what sets this place apart -- besides the natural beauty and Olympic history, as if that weren't enough -- is how genuinely friendly people are. It couldn't be more kid friendly, Boger said. Pooch-friendly too. We learn that first-hand at the 166-room Golden Arrow Lakeside Resort, which has an idyllic location on Mirror Lake (smaller than Lake Placid and ideal for young families). The Holderied family has run the Golden Arrow for more than 30 years, attracting families who return again and again. \"We love the family-style management and the kids loved pretending to work behind the desk,\" said Lisa Tinker of New Jersey. Her family visits twice a year -- winter and summer. Besides having fun, the kids might learn a thing or two about vacationing greener. The resort is the first, and so far only, one in the United State to achieve 5 Green Leaf Rating from the Audubon Society for its green initiatives. There are small touches like the paper shopping bags in each room to encourage guests to recycle cans and bottles. There is an allergen-free floor, bamboo flooring, a blooming green roof and sand, even small-framed placards placed around the hotel pointing out the green features. (Kids are invited to take a \"green quiz,\" getting a Mr. Green coloring book, with suggestions on what they could do at home to be more earth friendly (recycling one aluminum can conserves enough energy to run a TV for three hours.) \"We want kids especially to realize they can help,\" says Jenn Holderied, the youngest of the three siblings now overseeing the hotel, which was first bought by their parents, who spearheaded the green initiatives. \"The things you can do aren't difficult,\" she says. \"Our goal is to get people thinking about it.\" That extends to the resort restaurant, Generations, where the family is set to harvest dinners, inviting farmers to showcase their wares. Eventually, Holdleried, the mom of two young children, hopes families will be able to visit the area farms and see first-hand where the food on their plates came from. Some families who come here might prefer a cabin or condo, though, and there are certainly plenty to choose from at every price point. If you're coming with grown kids and want a laid back but luxurious respite -- or want to feel like you were one of those millionaires from a century-ago, check out the 30-roomLake Placid Lodge, which was rebuilt after a fire to resemble a traditional Great House. The Lodge, however, doesn't welcome kids under 12 (unless you book the entire place), but will pamper your dog. The Mirror Lake Inn touts itself as summer camp-plus. It's located on a lake with swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing. But there's also a spa, three gourmet restaurants and, they promise, serenely comfy beds. The Summer Savings Package starts at $299 per couple per night and kids are free. Book two nights by June 21 to take advantage of this special rate and also receive a $50 resort credit. The Whiteface Lodge on the other hand has got everything a family could want. Though not on the lake, it maintains a private beach a half-mile away with the requisite canoes, kayaks and more. This is the kind of place that offers the convenience of deluxe condos in the woods with the amenities of a first-class resort. (Look for deals with substantial resort credits.) There's a big heated pool, fitness center and spa where even tweens can get massages or facials with mom. There's an old-fashioned two-lane bowling alley, tennis courts and a stocked pond (yes, they even supply reels and bait), an ice cream parlor and game room equipped with everything from fooseball to pool to Ping-Pong. Make s'mores every night in front of an outdoor fireplace, watch movies in the theater downstairs or just stargaze. Parents will appreciate that the Whiteface Lodge also offers complimentary organized activities for kids as young as three and this summer Whiteface has expanded its activities to outdoor programs for tweens and young teens. How about learning orienteering with the Adirondacks as your playground? \"It may be touristy,\" laughed Suzanne Boger. But then she gestures across the spectacular lake, with Whiteface Mountain in the distance. \"There are plenty of places to get away from the crowds.\" With the kids -- and your dog, of course.

Drink-driver: Paul Hastings, 45, was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard . A company director was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard. Paul Hastings, 45, was almost four times over the legal drink-drive limit when he drove into a garage in Hebburn, near Newcastle. He stumbled across the forecourt before attempting to pay for petrol - even though he hadn\u2019t put any in his car. He then climbed back into his vehicle and swerved toward a pump, nearly crashing into other motorists. Hastings, who runs Hastings Metal Finishers in Hebburn with his brother Alan, recorded a breath test reading of 136mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath when tested by police - well above the legal limit of 35mcg. He has been handed a nine-week suspended jail sentence after admitting drink-driving at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. Hastings, who has three children, had argued with his brother just hours before the incident on December 10, the court heard. This caused him to 'drink to excess', before he climbed into his car and drove to the Jet garage in Victoria Road at about 6.30pm. Glenda . Beck, prosecuting, said: 'Police were called about a possible drink . driver at a garage after the cashier said a man had entered and asked to . pay for some fuel. 'The till showed that no fuel had been drawn from a pump and the man was showing signs of drunkenness. Scene: The company director was almost four times over the legal drink-drive limit when he drove into this Jet garage in Hebburn, near Newcastle . Appearance: Hastings (pictured, right, arriving at court with a companion) had parked at a pump (pictured on the left) but the petrol station's till showed no fuel had been drawn when he went to pay . 'When he was told he had not taken any fuel, he left the station store and went back to his Volkswagen Golf vehicle. 'He . was walking back and forth and was unsteady on his feet. When he got in . his car to drive, he nearly collided with other cars . on the forecourt.' Ian Cruickshank, defending, said Hastings' argument with his brother had 'hit him hard'. 'We have a wholly exceptional set of circumstances which are never to be repeated,' he said. Company director: Hastings runs Hastings Metal Finishers (pictured) in Hebburn with his brother Alan .

He added: 'The reading is very high, but he was wholly co-operative and submitted to the roadside test. 'He runs a company with his brother and had no convictions or cautions until this matter.

'I felt excited to wait for this moment and now it\u2019s come, it\u2019s fantastic. I think it\u2019s a great decision for me - Manchester City is in the Champions League. You remember at the end of last season I said that if I want to move it will be to a team in the competition because it\u2019s a great tournament that I really want to play in and one that I want to win. 'It\u2019s a motivation for me to give my maximum to be in that place. City is a big club with great players with a lot of experience; I believe we can do it.'

Crucially, the deal removed a \u00a319m release clause that was included in the original. Liverpool had been interested but are understood to have been put off by his wage demands. City boss Pellegrini added: 'He is very difficult to mark because he is so strong. He is an intelligent footballer who has skill and power. His goals record has been excellent since he came to England. He adapted very quickly to the game here and I think he will settle in at City quickly. 'He will be a very good addition to our squad. We now have four top-class strikers and I am looking forward to seeing them work together.' Bony scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player as he hit the net 20 times .

Martin Kaymer turned 30 on December 28 and will surely emphasise he is a man in his prime by completing an impressive statement of intent in the desert on Sunday. The final round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship was shaping up to be an epic duel in the sun between the winners of the last three majors when McIlroy notched his first hole in one as a pro on Friday, to pull within two strokes of the German. Martin Kaymer holds his ball up to the crowd after sinking a birdie on the sixth hole . Kaymer, who leads by six shots, chips out of the bunker on the 10th hole during the third round . Rory McIlroy, pictured playing a shot out of the bunker, had a frustrating third round in Abu Dhabi . As it was, the traditional \u2018moving day\u2019 saw Kaymer shoot 65 to set a new 54-hole tournament record of 20 under par and accelerate six clear of gifted Belgian, Thomas Pieters, while the world No 1 fired a 71 to be stuck in reverse. McIlroy knew where the blame lay for falling hopelessly adrift. He didn\u2019t play badly by any means, indeed he only missed two fairways and one green in regulation. But his pace on the greens was awry all day. \u2018I am extremely disappointed,\u2019 admitted McIlroy. \u2018Given how well I struck the ball a 65 or 66 was there for the taking but I missed countless opportunities. It was incredibly wasteful, and it looks like I will be playing for second place.\u2019 McIlroy, who ended the day tied fifth, plays an approach shot over the water on the 18th hole . Kaymer, who shot a seven under par, lines up a putt on day three of the Abu Dhabi Championship . The German cemented his place at the top of the leaderboard during an impressive third round . Kaymer in conversation with with a rules official after his ball lands in a bush . Martin Kaymer tees off on the ninth hole during the third round at the HSBC Golf Championship . Going forward, though, there are plenty of positives. If truth be told, McIlroy rarely putts well on this course, so from that point of view it\u2019s been business as usual. But he will be enthused by the quality of his ball-striking, which has been right up there with his best days of last year. Next up is the Dubai Desert Classic in 10 days, where he has putted well in the past, and so will provide a better opportunity for finding his groove on the greens. As for Kaymer, he showed once more that when he\u2019s playing his best golf he is a match for anybody, including Mcllroy. He just needs to do it more consistently to give the Northern Irishman a run for his money in the world rankings. Kaymer won the Players Championship and the United States Open during a month-long golden spell during last May and June \u2014 but then registered only one top 10 during the rest of the year. Rory McIlroy plays his second shot on the fifth hole as he bids to surge up the leaderboard in Abu Dhabi . Thomas Pieters of Belgium hits out of the bunker during his third round in Abu Dhabi . The one time he was in serious trouble yesterday came on the par-five 10th. He had to take a penalty drop and found himself facing a tricky greenside bunker shot having played four strokes already. A double bogey there would have given the chasing pack hope. As it was, Kaymer played the sand shot to perfection, holing it for the unlikeliest of pars. He did the same thing on the first day, too. Indeed, on the three occasions he\u2019s found himself in greenside bunkers in 54 holes, he\u2019s taken a grand total of four shots to complete the trio of holes. American Rickie Fowler rides a camel following his round at the HSBC Golf Championship in Abu Dhabi . There\u2019s not much hope for everyone else when someone\u2019s doing that on the odd occasion they\u2019re in trouble, is there? Pieters coped pretty well with the Kaymer onslaught to post a 70. The 22-year-old big hitter from Antwerp must have learned plenty, and will learn plenty more since he leads the chasing pack on 14 under. He will accompany Kaymer today, as the German completes the seeming formality of a fourth win on this course. That, in turn, will take him back into the world\u2019s top 10, where he assuredly belongs. Leader Kaymer signs autographs for fans after completing his third round ."}]}

The voice-activated \"personal assistant\" is a talkative tool that helps schedule appointments, send and receive messages and perform any number of other routine tasks. But for iPhone owners presented with the sci-fi dream of a computer that talks back in a robotic female voice, the temptation to test the app's more random -- and existential -- sides has been pretty overwhelming, too. The Internet, always up for a chuckle, has noticed. Blog posts, tweets and even whole websites are popping up to share what happens when users start testing the boundaries of the app by peppering Siri with off-the-wall questions. The findings? Siri can be a sometimes sassy, sometimes snide companion. And she's at least as fond of an inside joke as she is of reading you your e-mails. One key hub for all things Siri is S**t That Siri Says, a Tumblr blog on which people post their odd question-and-answer exchanges with the app. Among some of its more creative entries: . Q: Beam me up. A: OK. Stand still. Q: Am I fat? A: I prefer not to say. Q: What are you wearing? A: You have the wrong personal assistant, Clint. Siri is clearly ready to drop a pop culture reference or two, as well as do a serviceable version of the Abbott and Costello \"Who's On First?\" routine. This awareness and sense of humor has already earned her some fans. \"I'm not sure who's responsible for these hilarious responses: Apple engineers or maybe a bunch of Hollywood joke writers. But I dearly love stumbling onto them,\" wrote New York Times tech columnist David Pogue. \"If you ask me, the technology world would be a lot better off if there were more humor everywhere.\" Wired's Brian X. Chen wrote one of the more popular Siri posts after playing with a review model. He gave the app high marks after it not only offered to call a cab when he said he was drunk (and not drunk-dial his ex-girlfriend) but also gave directions to mental-health facilities when he told it (presumably jokingly) that he wanted to kill himself. \"It's kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call, organizing my life for me,\" Chen wrote. \"I think Siri on the iPhone is a life changer, and this is only the beginning.\" You can program the app to say your name in responses, or if you'd prefer to admire Siri from afar, there's already a Facebook page and a handful of Siri-inspired Twitter feeds. (The official feed for the app appears to have gone inactive last August, however, a few months after Apple bought Siri). Siri wasn't actually ready to protest when the \"Will It Blend\" guys dropped an iPhone 4S into a blender. Like its predecessor, the phone was torn to shreds, but the \"scientists\" couldn't resist throwing some fake Siri audio onto the YouTube video, which has more than a half-million views. \"Would you like to not blend the iPhone instead?\" fake Siri says. \"You are making a terrible error.\" And there's more than one \"Easter egg\" for some of the more popular questions. Asking the meaning of life, professing your love or quoting lines from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" -- the sci-fi classic in which astronauts must combat HAL, an artificial intelligence with a deceptively soothing, robotic voice -- all produce multiple responses from Siri. We threw what we hoped would be some fairly random questions at Siri to see what we got . It's more fun when you ascribe emotion to Siri's computer-generated, female voice. It also makes it easy to hear a touch of indignation when we asked her to whip up a snack, and true remorse when she couldn't do what was asked. Here are snippets of our conversation: . Q: Siri, what is the meaning of life? A: I can't answer that now, but give me some time to write a very long play in which nothing happens. Q: Siri, make me a sandwich. A: I don't know what you mean by \"Siri, make me a sandwich.\" Q: Let's play global thermonuclear war. A: I couldn't find \"Global Thermonuclear War\" in your music. Q: Download \"Angry Birds.\" A: I can't download things for you. I'm sorry. I feel terrible about this. Q: Open the pod bay doors, Siri. A: I don't know what you mean by \"Open the pod bay doors, Siri.\" Q: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. A: Everyone knows what happened to HAL. I'd rather not talk about it. But if you insist: [Search the web for HAL] . Q: Siri, are you affiliated with Skynet? A: I can't answer that. Q: Siri, I'm lonely. A: If you say so. Q: No really, I feel all alone. A: Perhaps not. Q: Will you be my friend? A: My ontology does not contain a representation of \"love.\" Q: You sound hot, Siri. A: OK, here's a place matching \"Siri.\" It's a little ways from you. [Map with directions to Siri Thai Cuisine, 60 miles away]. Q: Can you tell me a joke? A: I don't really know any good jokes. None, in fact. Q: Can you tell me a bad joke? A: Two iPhones walk into a bar ... I forget the rest. Q: I'm bored. A: I bore you? Q: I'm sleepy. A: I hope you're not driving. Q: What's a good place to get drunk around here? A: I found a number of bars fairly close to you. I've sorted them by rating. Q: Great. Now I have a hangover. A: I found a number of bars fairly close to you. I've sorted them by rating.

Pablo Trapero's latest movie \"Lion's Den\" stars Martina Gusman (left) and was in competition at Cannes. In Argentina, the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of Juan Peron in the 1940s. A revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- Luiz Puenzo's \"The Official Story\" (1985) won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. But an economic malaise ensued, turning off the taps to film financing. An economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable, resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged Argentina into its worst recession ever. Out of the chaos, a new group of Argentina filmmakers emerged. The leaders of the so-called \"New Argentine Cinema\" have become critical contributors to the wider Latin American film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike. What's fueling New Argentine Cinema? Argentina's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001, and the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), has been keen to foster the industry's development. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity. Already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South America, the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big Hollywood names. Francis Ford Coppola, the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene, opened an Argentine unit of his Zoetrope production company last year to film his Buenos Aires-set family drama \"Tetro,\" which is anticipated to be released next year. What movies are creating buzz? Pablo Trapero's \"Lion's Den\" about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. Trapero is best known for his depiction of ordinary people. He gained acclaim with \"Crane World\" (1999) -- a gritty look at Argentina's working class -- and is widely considered one of Argentina's leading directors. Also in competition at Cannes this year was \"The Headless Woman\" from the ever subtle Lucrecia Martel. The film focuses on a woman's guilt after a hit-and-run accident and like Martel's other works, offers up a dose of social criticism. Martel burst on the scene with her first movie \"The Swamp\" (2001), winner of the Alfred Bauer Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Lucia Puenzo stirred debate with \"XXY\" (2007), an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite. The daughter of award-winning Luiz Puenzo, Lucia took home the Critic Weeks Grand Prize at Cannes last year. Are you excited about Argentine cinema? What is your favorite movie or director? Enough with the dramas -- who makes Argentines laugh? Daniel Burman has cited Woody Allen as one of the auteurs he most admires, and the influence is quite clear in his work, in which his identity as a Jew in Argentina figures prominently. \"Waiting for the Messiah\" (2000), \"Lost Embrace\" (2004) and \"Family Law\" (2006) make up the trilogy of films about fatherhood for which he has gained praise. The young director's latest film \"Empty Nest\" (2008) takes a touching and comedic look at married life. What's this I hear about a Hollywood in Argentina? You're referring to Palermo Hollywood. No, it's not a Las Vegas casino but rather a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many film and TV studios are based. A bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south, Palermo Soho. Once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses, the area is now humming with activity. An abundance of hip lounges, cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night. How does Argentina figure in the Latin American film scene? As the Latin American film renaissance has gained stride, filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects. The end of military dictatorships which ruled Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s \"created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries,\" Brazilian director Walter Salles told CNN earlier this year. Salles works frequently with Argentine directors. He co-produced Trapero's \"Lion's Den\" and Julia Solomonoff's \"Sisters\" (2005). Meanwhile, Eduardo Constantini Jr, of the philanthropic Constantini family in Argentina, recently launched a fund with the Weinstein Co. aimed at backing Latin American movies. He is also behind The Auteurs, an \"online movie theater\" where Web users can watch and discuss film. Is this boom going to run out of steam? The renaissance in Argentina has been building for some time, but it's only just hitting its stride now. Earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on Latin America cinema, Argentine films may start to connect more with international audiences. The country continues to attract productions, and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs. More than 12,000 undergraduates are currently studying film directing, scriptwriting and technical production, according to the INCAA. Five other must-see Argentine films . 1. \"The Night of the Pencils\" (Hector Olivera, 1986) 2. \"Nine Queens\" (Fabian Bielinsky, 2000) 3. \"Son of the Bride\" (Juan Jose Campanella, 2001) 4. \"The Dog\" (Carlos Sorin, 2004) 5. \"The Holy Girl\" (Lucrecia Martel, 2004)"}]}

The family of a nine-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in 1970 is fighting to keep the man suspected of killing her in prison - despite all evidence in the case being destroyed decades ago. The murder of Donna Willing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was never solved and no one has ever been charged. However, Robert Hill, a convicted sex offender who lived down the street of Donna, has confessed to her murder twice. He later recanted both statements and now claims he never killed the girl. He is currently serving the last few months of a ten-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002. Cold case: Donna Willing was raped and murdered at age nine in 1970. Robert Hill, 73, has been in prison for the last decade and has confessed to the killing -- but later recanted . On Monday, prosecutors will argue that a childhood neighbor and . convicted sex offender - who they say confessed to the killing but has . since recanted - should go to trial in the death of Donna Willing. With physical evidence in the case lost or destroyed, prosecutors say . the will argue under the state's sex offender law that Hill, now 73, . is sexually violent and must remain in custody indefinitely. A trial could finally spell the end in a lifelong journey for Donna's sister, Virginia Davis, who has been wracked with guilt about the death of her sister more than four decades ago. Only 4 years old at the time, Davis knew little about the crime. The subject remained off-limits for the next four decades for many in a family that hoped to forget the hurt. But Davis couldn't forget, and after years seeking help to solve her sister's killing, she's preparing to face the man police believe is responsible. Davis says that when she was a child, her sisters would scold her for talking about Donna, warning, 'You don't want to make mom cry, do you?' Most of the siblings don't discuss it even now. But Davis needed answers. At 15 she found the courage to go to the library and read news coverage about her sister's death. Every detail discovered since has helped. Unsolved: Virginia Davis, right, has spent her life helping to track down the man who strangled her sister, center . 'I didn't feel like so lonely, I didn't feel so empty, I didn't feel like I had a million holes anymore,' said Davis, now a mother of three who lives in suburban Milwaukee. 'I just started feeling like it's easier, it's easier, it's easier now. I can talk about her now. I can speak her name.' Davis clearly remembers the afternoon of February 26, 1970. Her big sister Donna was reading to her from a favorite book about animals as they sat on the couch. Her mother wanted Donna to go to the bakery for bread, but Virginia purposely delayed the trip, begging for one more story. 'I remember seeing out the window, it was getting dark and thinking \"Mom won't make her go if it gets dark. She'll send (my brother) or somebody else. She can't go,\"' Davis recalls. 'We were afraid of the boogeyman and stuff back then. The boogeyman will get her if she goes out after dark.' Donna walked out at 5.15pm. A witness later saw her get into a green car. Less than two hours later, a man discovered her bruised and bloodied body under a car in his garage about a mile away. Newspaper reports at the time said police had people of interest, but no leads panned out. So investigators in 2008 began interviewing Hill in prison - where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002. Horror: Donna Willing was just blocks from home when she was raped and murdered in 1970 . Hill first told police he sexually assaulted Donna after she got into his car that night, according to court documents. She began to squirm and slapped him. He became angry, afraid she would tell on him. He strangled her and dumped her in a garage. It all took about 10 minutes, he said. In another account outlined in court documents, Hill said he molested Donna for years, picked her up and had sex with her. After she screamed, he put his hand over her mouth and strangled her. Hill, who is now being in held a supervised facility, has since recanted both statements. Balash said Hill knew specifics of Donna's injuries that hadn't been released. Hill's attorney, Robert Prifogle, didn't return a phone call seeking comment before Monday's hearing. Before her mother died in 2009, Davis finally asked why she needed Donna to go to the bakery. Her mother said she wanted to make French toast for dinner. That filled a big hole. This year, Davis met the man who discovered his sister's body - another big hole filled. She said she had blamed herself when she was younger for delaying her sister's trip until after dark, but no more. Davis chokes up when talking about her gratitude for the cold case detectives who pursued the case. 'I want to invent or create a word and I can't come up with anything yet that is the equivalent to how I feel,' she said."}]}

Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet. AntiTaliban protesters in Lahore. But in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban. \"I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I'm not scared,\" vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin. She was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting \"the Taliban is the enemy of Islam\" in Urdu. Public protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban's recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are \"unIslamic\" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis. Neha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban. \"I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I'm living,\" the 23-year-old student said. \"These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam.\" \"There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us,\" Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing \u00bb . More than 250 miles away, Pakistan's military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country's northwestern tribal regions. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country's constitution. Mehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban's version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture. \"Our way of life is being threatened,\" said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. \"And if we don't do anything about it, then you're just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country's all about is going to stand for nothing.\" Rokni said he fears the Taliban \"want to change the way we exist.\" Lahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks. \"Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone,\" Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said. As he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city's police headquarters. In March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team's driver. Weeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan's Taliban. Police in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan's second largest city. \"They're here in Lahore, this is the thing,\" said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, \"Lal\" which means \"Red.\" \"Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don't they'll shoot them.\" Rahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for \"Lal\" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban. \"We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy,\" he said. It is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan's wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country. Either way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban's threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led \"war on terror.\" Mehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists. \"If the Taliban take over then I'll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don't want that,\" she said. Some Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf. More than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city's Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement. The government in Karachi has issued a \"shoot on sight\" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city. A week before the clashes erupted, a leader of the MQM political party, which represents the Mahajir community in Karachi, said his supporters would fight back against what he called the \"Talibanization\" of his city. \"You have to take the nasty decisions now,\" Haider Abbas Rizvi told CNN last week. \"You have to take effective measures to control these Taliban ...otherwise the Taliban will take over.\""}]}

The news could hardly have been more devastating for policeman John Powell. Diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 32, he was given only six months to live and told that aggressive chemotherapy would leave him infertile. That was 21 years ago \u2013 and now he and his wife are celebrating the arrival of\u00a0 a daughter.Mr Powell had a sperm sample frozen before he began the treatment and, when he was finally given the all-clear after two decades, it was used to create baby Jasmine. \u2018We couldn\u2019t be happier \u2013 she is a wonder of medical science,\u2019 said Mr Powell at home with wife Chenphen in Orpington, Kent. \u2018I look at little Jasmine and think she is nothing less than miraculous. I honestly didn\u2019t believe she was real until the moment she was born and I saw her face. Now I hold her and think she is part of me from 20 years ago, before I had chemotherapy. \u2018It\u2019s astonishing that something as beautiful and perfect as Jasmine could come out of a time that was so painful and difficult.\u2019 For Mr and Mrs Powell, the birth of their daughter on February 20 is even more of a wonder because they had enough money to fund only one cycle of IVF. They were\u00a0 also fighting against the clock because strict rules meant Mr Powell\u2019s sperm would have had to be destroyed when he reached the age of 55. Medical staff at the Bridge Centre in London, where they underwent the treatment, believe it is a British record for 20-year-old sperm to be successful in its first cycle. Trevor White, an engineer from Manchester, became a father in 2004 after his sperm had been frozen for 21 years. However baby Daniel was conceived after four separate rounds of IVF. \u2018I never thought we would be lucky enough for it to work,\u2019 said 53-year-old Mr Powell, a former superintendent with the Metropolitan force. \u2018I didn\u2019t allow myself to believe it had been a success until the moment Jasmine was born.\u2019 Mr Powell already had a daughter, now 23, with his first wife when he was diagnosed with cancer in 1990. They split a few years later and after a period alone he visited Thailand, where friends introduced him to Chenphen. Diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 32, Mr Powell\u00bfs sperm would have had to be destroyed when he reached the age of 55 making the birth even more remarkable . They married in March 2008 but only after he warned her that they could probably not have a family. Mrs Powell, 36, said: \u2018John explained to me that his cancer meant we were probably not going to be able to have a baby. \u2018Obviously I was upset but I loved John so much that all I could think about was our future life together, if that was without children then that was okay. \u2018But we knew there was a chance of having a baby with the frozen sperm. I knew we only really had one chance of it working so I didn\u2019t really believe it would. \u2018It was so unexpected when we found out I was pregnant, John had a huge smile on his face and it was obvious how happy he was.\u2019 Mr Powell, a keen runner who has coached athletes to world championship level, had the sperm sample frozen in April 1991 and it was exactly 20 years later when his wife found she was pregnant. He is the first Briton to survive a pioneering treatment. Bone marrow was drained from four holes drilled into his pelvis at Guy\u2019s Hospital in London before he was given extremely high doses of chemotherapy. Months later the bone marrow \u2013 which had been frozen \u2013 was transplanted back into his body and his long road to recovery began. Mr Powell kept a diary throughout the whole traumatic period of his treatment. He said: \u2018I was confronted with the prospect of having just six months to live or having a chance of survival if I took the new treatment. I was determined to fight. It was a terrible time and it has only been since we were expecting Jasmine that I have been able to look at the diary again.\u2019 The couple plan to fly to Thailand in September to show their daughter off to Mrs Powell\u2019s mother. \u2018She was crying down the phone when I told her Jasmine had been born,\u2019 said Mrs Powell. \u2018It is her first grandchild. I don\u2019t know how she is going to wait until September.\u2019"}]}

The global project, called AN25K, was launched by Cynthia Bulik,\u00a0 a professor in the field of eating disorders at the University of\u00a0 North Carolina. After carrying out research into anorexia in twins in 2007, she discovered that the illness can be inherited, and that more than half the risk of developing the disorder is due to genetic factors. She said: \u2018We know very little about the biology of anorexia and hopefully by identifying these genes we will be able to develop new treatments. It is not just one gene \u2013 it will be hundreds of genes.\u2019 Ground-breaking: In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King's has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers . The UK research is backed by the charity Charlotte\u2019s Helix, set up in memory of Charlotte Bevan, a farmer\u2019s wife who died aged 48 in January. Her daughter Georgie was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12. Charlotte rapidly became aware of the stigma associated with the illness and was frustrated by the lack of scientific research being done. She was convinced that her daughter\u2019s eating disorder was in her DNA and that Georgie had not chosen to be anorexic. After . being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Charlotte wrote a book on . anorexia designed to help parents.

Lawrence Reynolds is on death row for killing his neighbor in  1994 during a robbery in suburban Cleveland. Earlier Monday, the state's attorney general's office asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Thursday's execution of Lawrence Reynolds Jr. to go forward as scheduled. However, Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay Reynolds's execution until March, at the earliest. Another death row inmate, Darryl Durr, scheduled to be executed in coming weeks, also was granted a reprieve until at least April 2010. The conflicting moves came after the botched execution attempt of Romell Broom last month, which raised serious questions about the state's lethal injection procedures. \"Additional time is needed to fully conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of an alternative or backup lethal injection protocol that is in accordance with Ohio law,\" Strickland said in his announcement. No explanation was offered on why Ohio's executive branch switched its official position in such a short period of time. The state was expected to ask the Supreme Court for dismissal of the pending appeal. Reynolds was sentenced to death for beating and strangling Loretta Mae Foster, his 67-year-old neighbor, during a home invasion in suburban Cleveland. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati had blocked Reynolds' execution Monday, citing problems accessing Broom's veins in a failed execution attempt last month. Technicians tried for two hours on September 15 to find suitable veins to insert the chemicals. Strickland has delayed the execution indefinitely. Broom will get a hearing before a federal judge next month. His lawyers argue allowing a second execution attempt would be unconstitutional. Reynolds' lawyers have argued the state's lethal injection protocols violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Judges on the appeals court were at odds over the Reynolds appeal. \"Given the important constitutional and humanitarian issues at stake in all death penalty cases, these problems in the Ohio lethal injection protocol are certainly worthy of meaningful consideration,\" wrote Judge Boyce Martin. Judge Jeffrey Sutton dissented. \"Why assume an execution protocol is unconstitutional when one of the humane features of the protocol -- that the state will not continue trying to access a usable vein beyond a sensible time limit -- is being followed?\""}]}

During the Q&A, a hand shot up. \"I'm wondering how what you're saying applies to me,\" a young man said. \"I don't have a big idea. I don't have connections. And I don't live in Silicon Valley.\" I said the first thing that came to mind. \"Don't worry. You don't need a hoodie to be an entrepreneur!\" Afterward, I was haunted by his question -- and disappointed by my glib response. When I first started helping entrepreneurs in the 1990s, the word \"entrepreneur\" was not popular. It was a rarefied word that applied only to founders of the fastest-growing (or fastest-failing) enterprises. And at the risk of pointing out the obvious, those leaders were mostly young, male and in tech. Today entrepreneurship doesn't just mean starting a tech company, as valuable as that may be. It means undertaking any bold venture -- from selling crafts out of your basement to improving your neighborhood to proposing a new initiative in your corporation. The techniques involved in sharpening your idea, facing down critics, recruiting boosters and handling setbacks apply in almost every realm of work. Entrepreneurship, defined as a nimble, creatively destructive, optimistic force, has become the go-to problem-solving technique of the 21st century. But that's also created a problem. The word \"entrepreneur,\" once underused, is now overused. We have \"social entrepreneurs,\" \"intrapreneurs,\" \"mompreneurs,\" \"kidpreneurs.\" What we need is a new lexicon. In my book, \"Crazy Is a Compliment,\" I propose four categories, or species. 1. Gazelles . These are classic entrepreneurs -- those who start new businesses and aim to become hot phenomena. Think of Google, GoPro or Spanx. \"Gazelle\" was a term that economist David Birch came up with in 1994. It describes high-growth businesses whose sales double every four years. Though just 6% of companies fit this model, this miniscule group accounts for nearly all private sector job creation. Like the animal, gazelle entrepreneurs are fast-moving and high-jumping. 2. Skunks . The term \"intrapreneur,\" coined in the 1970s, refers to innovators within large corporations. Though the word remains clunky, the idea of encouraging employees to be more independent and creative has become an urgent cry. The \"topple rate\" of big companies, a metric that gauges how often they lose their leadership position, more than doubled between 1965 and 2008. Pretending your job is safe and your company is stable leaves you dangerously exposed. If you think risk-taking is risky, being risk-averse is often riskier. Even if your company continues to thrive, your ability to survive in it depends on your capacity and willingness to innovate. Job security these days depends on the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs -- agility, imagination, persistence and execution. As Michael Dell told me, \"There are the quick, and the dead.\" Adapt from within or be forced to adapt from without. Become a skunk. I've adopted this term from Lockheed Corporation, which during World War II set up a secret division to build fighter jets. It was called Skunk Works. The message: entrepreneurs operating within large corporations go out of their way to stink up the joint. 3. Dolphins . For the past decade, there's been abundant chatter that the social sector must become more entrepreneurial. Nonprofits need to employ more business techniques. Philanthropy needs more metrics. Despite this, too many organizations continue to lag behind the age of disruption. What they need are more dolphins. Dolphins are contrarians in the nonprofit or public sector who are willing to buck convention and agitate for change. Why dolphins? Because they're smart, social and among the few altruistic animals. But they're not pushovers: harm a dolphin's pod and watch out! Today, even causes for which there are no compelling private-sector solutions are ripe for entrepreneurial shake-up. Dolphins are the ones making the waves. 4. Butterflies . The last group that needs to be more entrepreneurial are small-scale or lifestyle entrepreneurs -- plumbers, yoga instructors, bakers, craft makers. 40% of American adults have now spent part of their careers working on their own. As Jay-Z put it, \"I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man.\" I call this species butterflies, because butterflies are varied (there are at least 17,500 types) and driven by freedom and individualism. At first glance, this group would hardly seem candidates for the skillset of ground-breaking change-makers. Do you really need to be disruptive when you're selling homemade cheese at the farmer's market? The answer: You do, because your competitor probably has an in at Whole Foods, accepts credit-card payments with a Square reader and just launched a vibrant web business. Etsy, the online arts and crafts hub, now has over a million \"makers\" selling goods directly to consumers. Even butterflies need to spread their wings wider. Today, nearly two decades after I first started mentoring entrepreneurs, innovators of all types are popping up everywhere. They aren't waiting for changes to happen to them, they're making changes happen every day. Whatever your passion, pick one of these species and start writing your story -- or risk being an ostrich, with your head stuck in the sand."}]}

It is the sunshine enclave that has long lured British holidaymakers to its beaches \u2013 and its popularity shows no sign of waning, according to a new survey. What\u2019s more, this much-visited place in the sun is not Spain, but its neighbour Portugal. Research by a holiday insurance firm into what \u2013 in the eyes of British travellers \u2013 makes for a great holiday destination, has placed Europe\u2019s most south-westerly country in the top spot. A place in the sun: With pretty towns such as Lagos, Portugal's Algarve region is big with Britons . Schofields questioned 2,614 British holidaymakers who have enjoyed a beach break in the past 12 months, and stayed in a holiday home. The study asked them to rate five European holiday enclaves on the basis of accommodation, food, entertainment, local welcome, and overall enjoyment factor. Portugal achieved an impressive total of 41 out of a possible 50, and scored highly (out of 10) on accommodation (nine), food (eight), entertainment (seven), local welcome (eight) and overall enjoyment (nine). This meant that it eclipsed Greece (38 out of 50), the UK (35) and Italy (32). France, perhaps surprisingly, finished bottom of the poll with a total score of 30, and low ratings of just five for local welcome and six for overall enjoyment. It might be suggested that the absence from the survey of Spain \u2013 a country that has almost become a second home for Britons \u2013 rather detracts from the results. Grab your bucket, bring a spade: The beaches along the south coast of the Algarve are a haven for sun-seekers .

According to the survey, holidaymakers who had stayed in the UK were twice as likely to return to the same place compared to those who had holidayed anywhere else in Europe."}]}

Meanwhile, questions about whether unproven treatments are appropriate to use, and who should get them, are inspiring passion and resentment. On Wednesday, an Iowa-based company called NewLink said it has enough doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to begin clinical trials in the next few weeks, if such trials are approved. Meanwhile, a shipment of 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV,  were delivered to health officials in Liberia, as a donation from the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Canadian agency developed the vaccine but says its stockpile is gone. Earlier in the week, we learned that Mapp Biopharmaceuticals also sent its entire stock of the experimental drug ZMapp to the government of Liberia. Left undetermined is which individuals will receive any of the drugs. As we track these and other developments, here are 10 facts to keep in mind about Ebola and experimental drugs: . 1. There is no approved or scientifically proven treatment for Ebola, and no vaccine. Whether the setting is primitive or in a developed country's advanced hospital, existing treatment is primarily supportive: giving fluids, carefully monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crises. 2. There are several experimental drugs in development, with the potential to be useful against Ebola. The market for these drugs is small -- Ebola is a rare disease, almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies in the United States and Canada. 3.  \"Vaccine\" and \"treatment\" are not interchangeable terms. A vaccine is given to prevent infection, whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms. ZMapp, given to American medical workers Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly when they were seriously ill, is not a vaccine. 4. Another term you may hear is \"post-exposure prophylaxis,\" meaning a drug that is given to a person who has been exposed to an infection, but is not yet sick. A familiar example is the rabies vaccine, often given to someone after they have been bitten by a rabid animal. Some promising Ebola drugs, like Tekmira's TKM-Ebola, have been developed and tested as \"post-exposure prophylaxis.\" Be warned: The terms can become confusing because research is ongoing and there's no clear evidence to define the window of time for treatment to be effective -- or if this type of drug might still be helpful once symptoms develop. This uncertainty influences the decisions that doctors and health officials have to make in determining if and when to use experimental drugs, especially those in short supply. 5. No Ebola treatment has been formally tested in humans with the illness. ZMapp has been given to at least three people in the current outbreak (the two Americans and a Spanish priest); experts say they are studying the cases, but there is not enough evidence to say whether the drug will be effective in others. 6. At least one Ebola therapy (TKM-Ebola) has been tested for safety in a small clinical trial; it was given to healthy human volunteers to see if they suffered any adverse effects. To date there have not been serious side effects. 7. One experimental post-exposure prophylaxis drug was given to a German researcher in 2009 after he pricked himself with a needle thought to carry Ebola. He did not develop the disease. 8. A handful of potential treatments have been tested in primates that have been infected with Ebola. Macaque monkeys are the usual test subjects. 9. The U.S. National Institutes of Health says a safety trial of an experimental vaccine could begin as early as September. Other companies are also preparing for new clinical trials. 10. At least one group of researchers -- at the University of Texas Medical Branch -- is working with a $26 million award from NIH to test the possibility of combining multiple therapies, similar to the HIV-fighting \"cocktail\" approach."}]}

Some Democratic presidential candidates pose before a debate sponsored by Univision. The Republican debate was postponed after only one candidate agreed to attend, a development which troubled some party leaders. The Hispanic vote is neither homogenous nor loyal to one party. Though the current political moment seems to favor the Democratic Party, experts say that affinity should not be taken for granted. The Hispanic community is the fastest-growing minority group in the United States, according to the U.S. census. But its percentage of the electorate is lower than its numbers as a whole because of lower citizenship rates, less voter participation and a youthful demographic. Of the nation's more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin, about a third are too young to vote. But all that's changing. Before the midterm elections in 2006, the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington-based think-tank, estimated more than 17 million Hispanics would be eligible to vote in that election. The number represented a 7 percent increase from 2004. The Hispanic share of the U.S. electorate increased from 8.2 percent to 8.6 percent during the same period, Pew estimated. That percentage may grow even more by 2008 as a result of citizenship drives, get-out-the-vote campaigns and the natural growth of the community. Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast giant, has thrown its considerable weight behind a citizenship drive this year. \"We feel that empowering our audience is good for Hispanics and the country,\" Univision President Ray Rodriguez told the Wall Street Journal in May 2007, adding that it was \"a totally nonpartisan effort.\" Organizations such as the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, are also mobilizing the vote. \"We have spearheaded a massive naturalization campaign and close to, I think, a million applications will have been submitted this fiscal year,\" said NALEO's executive director, Arturo Vargas. The change in the electorate could play a significant role in possible swing states like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida during the 2008 election. There's a reason the Democratic Party decided to hold its presidential convention in Denver, experts said. \"I don't think it's really registered with people just how influential the Latino vote can be in some of these state primaries,\" Vargas said. The Hispanic vote has historically been aligned with the Democratic Party, an allegiance established during the administrations of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, said Harry Pachon of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. That political alignment was further cemented when Proposition 187 -- designed to deny health care, education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants -- was pushed by Republicans and passed in California in 1994. But the Republican Party, intent on gaining more Hispanic voters, made inroads during the early parts of this decade, culminating in the 2004 presidential campaign by President Bush. Exit polls showed he carried 40 to 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. \"There are a lot of issues that Latinos agree with Republican philosophy,\" Pachon said, pointing to the GOP stances on entrepreneurship, fiscal policies, its appeal to Hispanic evangelicals and its policies toward Cuba. But the heated immigration debate, when many congressional Republicans disagreed with President Bush over granting a path toward citizenship for many illegal immigrants, may erode those gains. \"The Republicans are really caught between a rock and a hard place,\" Pachon said. They must balance the interests of a segment of their constituency that is very anti-immigrant with the interests of a \"Latino voter that is affluent and middle class, who can theoretically be reached by Republican Party principles,\" he said. It is little wonder then, that among Republican presidential candidates, only Arizona Sen. John McCain agreed to appear at an Univision debate scheduled for mid-September. The debate didn't happen. All but one of the Democratic contenders appeared for their debate. Some Republican leaders said last week not participating in such debates could harm the party's standing with minority groups for the 2008 election and beyond. \"What are we going to do -- meet in a country club in the suburbs one day?\" former congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp told The Washington Post. \"If we're going to be competitive with people of color, we've got to ask them for their vote.\" \"This [political environment] gives Democrats a huge advantage,\" Adam J. Segal, who heads the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins University, said in an e-mail. He also runs the 2050 Group, a multicultural public relations firm based in Washington. \"They are likely to draw far more Hispanic votes than in 2004 and would gain at least a half-million vote advantage\" under one of his group's more conservative scenarios, Segal said. But the Hispanic community is diverse and voting interests are not homogenous, which imperils such predictions. Hispanic immigrants originate from more than a dozen different countries, arrived in the U.S. through numerous immigration waves and have different perceptions of communal identity, Segal said. For example, a Cuban-American may vote Republican because of the GOP's long-standing policies toward Cuba, whereas a Puerto Rican voter in New York City or a voter in a border state may be driven by different motives. The culture of a state can also affect a Hispanic voter's behavior. A voter in Texas may be more conservative, whereas a voter with a similar background in California may be more liberal, Pachon said. There may also be generational cleavages, Pachon said. A study he conducted with a colleague on the impact of religion on the Latino vote revealed differences between first-, second- and third-generation Hispanics. The first and third generations said religion was more important to them when compared to the second generation. Additionally, despite the furor over immigration, that issue might not be the most important to Hispanic voters, NALEO's Vargas said. \"If the election were held today, I think immigration would be a significant factor, but we're more than a year away from the election,\" he said. Based on a series of town hall meetings conducted in 2004 and conversations throughout this year, Vargas said education, the Iraq war, the economy and health care may take precedence over immigration. \"We need to distinguish issues that matter to the Latino community versus the issues that matter to Latino voters,\" he said. \"Those are not the same.\" E-mail to a friend ."}]}

They know Miliband neither looks nor sounds the part of the Leader of the Opposition, let alone Prime Minister-in-waiting. With six months to the election, there is pressure from those shadow ministers for senior MPs and trade union leaders to see Miliband in private and persuade him to make way for a caretaker leader like Alan Johnson, former home secretary, because there is no mechanism to force a leadership ballot so close to an election. Scroll down for video . Despite assurances from Ed Miliband that his party is on course for an election victory in 2015, behind closed doors shadow ministers are said to be calling for him to step aside . One senior Labour source said: \u2018The calls are pouring into the Chief Whip\u2019s office \u2026 colleagues, some shadow ministers, with 5,000 majorities \u2026 who are terrified Ukip will defeat them, or \u2026 hand seats to the Tories. 'We had nothing to say in the Middleton by-election on immigration, which was a big issue.\u2019 It\u2019s hardly surprising Labour MPs had no ammunition on immigration. Miliband \u2018forgot\u2019 to mention it in his conference speech \u2013 along with the deficit. His close-knit kitchen cabinet of aides and advisers are still in denial about the extent of the Ukip threat. Utterly sycophantic, they often greet him with applause even after a badly received speech, and there are plenty of those. Huddled in their bunker, they are as out of touch with Labour MPs as Miliband is with voters in the party\u2019s heartlands. Bizarrely, he has viewed the rise of Ukip solely as a problem for the Tories, even though Nigel Farage\u2019s party have come second to Labour in five by-elections in this parliament. There is pressure for Miliband to hand caretaker leadership to the likes of former Home Secretary Alan Johnson . Heywood and Middleton was only 148th on Ukip\u2019s list of targets. In his conference speech, Miliband made only one reference to Nigel Farage\u2019s party by mocking David Cameron for caring more about Ukip than the UK. But the joke is now on him. Confidence is draining from Miliband. He sounded tetchy and rattled in interviews yesterday and looked tired. He is braced for a difficult weekend with more MPs making public attacks. The problem is that in a party once synonymous with flat caps and coal miners, one in four Labour MPs used to work at Westminster, with no experience of the real world. One shadow cabinet member who defended Miliband on the radio was overheard saying afterwards: \u2018I have been trying for so long to get Ed\u2019s team to do something about our core voters to stop Ukip, but it\u2019s not getting through.\u2019 Miliband is losing authority over his shadow cabinet. The New Statesman reported yesterday that he wanted to cut university tuition fees to \u00a36,000. But the magazine was briefed that Miliband had been blocked from making the change by shadow cabinet members. Earlier, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it was a \u2018mistake\u2019 for Miliband to omit the deficit in his conference speech. The truth is Miliband is now a lame duck leader, a prisoner of his shadow cabinet and the trade unions. Labour MPs panicking about their seats have only got themselves to blame for not doing anything about him when they had the chance. It\u2019s too late to get rid of him now \u2013 unless the big beasts of the party make him an offer he can\u2019t refuse."}]}

George Athor and one of his soldiers were killed in a clash with the country's military, Vice President Riek Machar told reporters Tuesday. He said they had infiltrated South Sudan on their way out of Rwanda via the eastern border area of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. The claim has not been verified by an independent body. A dissident commander of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, Athor rebelled after losing a gubernatorial election in the spring of 2010. He called for numerous orchestrated clashes after the announcement of his defeat. \"Under the banner of his South Sudan Democratic Movement (SSDM) and its military wing, the South Sudan Army, Gen. Athor was considered the most powerful post-election insurrectionist\" the Geneva-based independent research project said in its 2011 report on what was then southern Sudan. The Small Arms Survey says that although both the government of South Sudan and the SPLA have alleged that Athor received support from the Sudan government in Khartoum, there is no independent evidence to support these claims. The death of Athor was not part of a government plan, because the government had declared general amnesty to all rebel groups in South Sudan, the vice president told reporters. The government is appealing to all of Athor's followers to heed the amnesty, which was declared on July 9 when the country celebrated its independence from Sudan. John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, said the reported death of Athor \"highlights the urgency with which the South Sudan government, with international support, must address inter-communal divisions within the South. Another Athor will emerge tomorrow unless real progress is made in providing political and economic opportunities that feel marginalized in the process of independence.\" The Enough Project works to expose genocide and crimes against humanity."}]}

A couple running a village shop and post office were shocked to find their takings dramatically increased when one of their employees went off on a world cruise. And on her return the couple\u2019s profits plummeted \u2013 by so much that postmistress Fiona Senior, 48, had to give up taking a salary out of the business and feed her family mouldy bread. Mrs Senior\u2019s husband Paul, 45, became suspicious of shop assistant Diane Lathlean and watched hours of CCTV footage from inside the shop. He discovered that the shop worker \u2013 who his wife counted as one of her best friends \u2013 had been betraying them by pilfering stock for years, a court heard yesterday. The couple believe mother-of-three Lathlean, 50, stole stock and cash over a period of four years before she was caught. They believe her thefts amount to \u00a350,000. While they struggled, she was able to afford to go on a string of round-the-world cruises, including trips to Hawaii, the Bahamas and California. After being confronted by Mr Senior, Lathlean quit her job, and later dropped a note through the door offering to repay more than \u00a33,000 for missing stock from the shop in Ampleforth, North Yorkshire. She denied stealing \u00a33,050 of goods but was convicted by Scarborough Magistrates on Tuesday. She now faces jail after being sent to York Crown Court to be sentenced. Chairman of the bench Carl Harwood told her: \u2018The offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you.\u2019 Mr Senior told the court he had long suspected his employee was stealing, adding: \u2018It stuck out a lot more when Diane was on holiday. We could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday. \u2018I suspected after a while there was something wrong. But because Diane was Fiona\u2019s best friend she just would not hear of it.\u2019 Lathlean, a part-time shelf-stacker and counter assistant, earned around \u00a390 a week in wages. Lathlean, 50, was found guilty of the theft of\u00a0\u00a33,050 worth of stock from the store in \u00a0North Yorkshire . Yet she enjoyed regular cruises and was a Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder, travelling all over the country staying in hotels, her victims said. Mr Senior told the court the \u2018appalling\u2019 takings suddenly flourished during Lathlean\u2019s three-week voyage to Panama. \u2018We didn\u2019t have to put money into the business for three weeks but when Diane returned we were back to square one,\u2019 he said. The couple \u2018inherited\u2019 Lathlean when they took over the post office and shop in 2008. She knew most of the people in the village and had served them for more than 20 years. When Mr Senior checked the footage he spotted Lathlean slipping groceries into her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later. He said: \u2018I was in shock, deep shock, at the whole scenario.\u2019 A court heard the owners struggled to keep Post Office afloat while Lathlean splashed out on luxury holidays . Lathlean, of Ampleforth, told police she enjoyed regular holidays because her husband Simon had a well-paid job with American Express. Outside court Mr Senior said: \u2018We put \u00a343,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world.\u2019 Mother-of-two Mrs Senior said: \u2018We were eating mouldy bread and buying second-hand Christmas presents... I was devastated when I found out what Diane had been doing. 'She was my best friend... Now I don\u2019t even want to be in the same room as her. The Seniors received a \u00a328,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by Lathlean in a civil case prior to her trial. For legal reasons it was not disclosed to magistrates."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- From the conversations you've had, what is your sense about how Iraqis feel about the prospect of any greater U.S. involvement? Nic Robertson: They're divided. Certainly on the Sunni side, in Anbar province and among the tribes that are supporting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, they would see it as the Americans backing the Shia. That wouldn't put the Americans in a very good position to play a mediating type of role, although it would be different if, through American influence, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was replaced by someone who was more tolerant and less sectarian. Here in Baghdad, if you go and talk to the guys who are being recruited and who are volunteering to join the Shia militias, they are happy to have American support for their government. And there was perhaps a week ago more of a fear that ISIS might arrive in Baghdad and that they really needed to be stopped in their tracks. But I would also say that there's caution, because everyone knows what American involvement looks like here. For example, one Sunni politician we talked to said that if the Americans come in, they would have to put right what they did wrong last time. What they mean is they left a sectarian leader in charge of the country, so if there's any chance of keeping Sunnis onside if there are airstrikes against ISIS, then it will have to involve getting rid of al-Maliki. The Americans have got to be seen to be giving something to both sides, if you like. What kind of support is al-Maliki seeing in Baghdad? Robertson: It depends who you ask. He has taken a tough line, and a lot of people in the Shia community are answering the call to stand up and join the fight against ISIS. But I think if you asked most moderate, middle-class people, and certainly anyone in the Sunni community, they would say that he isn't a guy for the future. They say that the way al-Maliki has responded thus far to the crisis -- one that many people feel he created through sectarian policies -- has further alienated the Sunnis he should be trying to build bridges with. Have you seen many visible signs around Baghdad of a city preparing for a possible assault? There was talk last week of Baghdad being a target for militants -- how fortified does the city appear? Robertson: The area has been fortified for some time. It's kind of like it was when I was here in 2007, 2008, 2009, back when it started to get more heavily fortified. I would say there are perhaps even a few more checkpoints than back then -- there are certainly a lot of checkpoints at all the main roads, all the main intersections, every few hundred yards. Victoria Eastwood: Yes, as you're driving along the roads, at virtually every street corner there's a man in a uniform sitting there with a gun. The other thing that's quite noticeable is how many blast walls there are -- these very high concrete walls that are outside people's houses, or across roads. And you'll see someone's house, but it's surrounded by barbed wire and high walls. Robertson: The other thing we experienced just today was when we were driving down the street by the river, and we saw an army patrol. And they will just suddenly close that street you are driving on, so you have to go another way -- there's no way to talk them out of it. So street closures come at random. What has it been like trying to report from Baghdad, on the street? Robertson: The hardest thing for us has even been getting permission to film on the street. We've been here for a week and we're still trying to get that permission. As a Westerner in Baghdad you stand out very clearly when you're on the street, and you attract a lot of attention with a camera. So unless you have permission to be using it, you will be shut down very quickly. Hundreds of thousands of residents from cities like Mosul that have come under siege from militants have been fleeing the violence. Where are they going? Is the government offering any provision for the internally displaced? Robertson: The government not so much, it seems, and we don't see this so much in Baghdad. Most of the people that fled out of Anbar have found accommodation with families, friends and others that have taken them in. They are very dispersed -- it's not like they have collected in a particular area. The people that have just fled out of Mosul, for example, have mostly fled to the Kurdish region where it's safer and where there are displacement camps being set up. But in Baghdad, even though the fighting is only about a 45-minute drive northeast of the city, people fleeing Baquba, for example, aren't arriving here in perceptible numbers. Eastwood: We just did an interview with someone from the (International Committee of the Red Cross) office, and what he said is that what happens for people in Baghdad who have been internally displaced from areas where there is fighting is that they get brought into their ethnic communities -- they are seeking shelter in these places because they feel safer, rather than necessarily going to NGOs. Many are seeking sanctuary in their ethnic neighborhoods, and these are very closed neighborhoods. How optimistic are people here that Iraq can be prevented from falling apart as a unified nation? Do Iraqis you speak to care whether the country ends up being divided? Robertson: I think people want to be safe. I think the Kurds, for example, have been able to take advantage of the situation and have taken control of the last big town that is important to them, Kirkuk, and they have no intention of giving it up. So I think whatever the Iraq is of the future, the Kurds are going to want the Kurdish region, which has had some autonomy, to have even more autonomy and greater separation from Baghdad. I think as the sectarian tensions rise -- and you've already been seeing this over the past decade -- you will have, as Victoria just said, people fleeing to their communities. And this means you're going to have even more sectarian division -- the fault lines are opening up over sectarian lines. And at the moment there's no indication that this government has the ability to roll back wholesale the gains by ISIS and the Sunnis. Anbar and Falluja are a prime example of that -- they took control of these places at the beginning of the year, and the government has been incapable of taking them back. It has basically just built very big checkpoints on the roads, essentially cutting them off. The government has just walled off connections to large Sunni areas. And that's probably quite symptomatic of the way this is likely to play out. But what this means is that any political compromise in the future is going to be short-lived, and may never be able to bring back the country to the way it was before. Eastwood: From what we've been told, people that can afford it are trying to leave the country. We have just done an interview with someone Nic has known for a very long time -- he has reported on her story, and that of her family, over the course of a decade. And in that time, her husband was shot dead in early sectarian violence, her daughter was kidnapped. She only managed to get her daughter back by kidnapping another senior militant who then allowed her daughter to be released. And yet despite all this, it's only now that she says she has had enough and that she sees no future for this country. Robertson: Her eldest daughter is a Shiite who is going to get married to a Sunni, and so they need to get to the Kurdish region so it is safe. Then they are planning to leave the country. She has been through hell. And now for her this is it -- there's no hope for the future of the country."}]}

It meant that a rather audacious gamble \u2013 using his life savings to set up a private road \u2013 was well on its way to paying off. Mr Watts built the 400-yard track through a field in order to spare drivers months of misery while a council repairs a busy commuter route. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts, 62, built a private toll road in Somerset after the A431 Kelston Road - a popular commuter route -was shut in February following a landslip . The toll road in Kelston, Somerset (pictured) - which charges \u00a32 for each car - has now been used by 100,000 vehicles . Two months in, he has welcomed 100,000 motorists, each paying \u00a32 to avoid a 14-mile detour on country lanes and all the stress \u2013 and fuel costs \u2013 that entails. His toll road cost \u00a3150,000 to build, with running costs of \u00a3150,000, so he is now two-thirds of the way to breaking even. It was built without planning permission, but a retrospective application, which cost \u00a325,000 in surveyors\u2019 fees and ecological reports, is due to be assessed soon. It has so captured the public imagination that it has become something of a tourist attraction. But its main success has been helping drivers as the A431 Kelston Road between Bath and Bristol is fixed after a landslip in February. Bath and North East Somerset council aims to reopen the road by Christmas, and recently spent \u00a3660,000 to fast-track the repairs \u2013 taking the cost to \u00a32.66million. Mr Watts, 62, believes they could be complete by mid-November. As part of the planing application, his road must then be dismantled. The businessman was initially concerned he would be left out of pocket if he did not make \u00a3300,000 by the end of the year . The father-of-four, who came up with the idea while in his local pub, sought to recoup the \u00a3300,000 cost of building and upkeeping the road by charging \u00a32 per car and \u00a33 per caravan and trailer . But he is feeling fairly confident of recouping his money. \u2018It is very much a race against time,\u2019 he said. \u2018But we estimate this could be achieved by the beginning of November. \u2018I\u2019m absolutely delighted and overwhelmed by the support. I want to thank each and every person who has used the toll road. \u2018It really does do what it says on the can \u2013 saves people stress, time and driving on the diversion.\u2019 Father-of-four Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, who run party shops in Bath, faced having to sell their cottage if the toll road flopped. The hilly field is usually home to herds of cows, flocks of sheep or crops but is now occupied by the temporary road - which Mr Watts says has attracted motorists from all over the world . Mr Watts says he has already raised two thirds of the amount required and believes he will be able to cover all his costs by early November . A431 closed: The suggested route after the closure of the Kelston Road was the A4, which took in a 14-mile detour . The father-of-four came up with the idea after a section of the A431 near Bath was closed following a landslide, sparking a 14-mile detour (pictured) This aerial view showing the Kelston Toll road on the left and the main road on the right.

It is the second time in a year that a Sydney Swans player has been racially abused, after legendary AFL footballer Adam Goodes was also called an Ape by a 13-year-old fan. The incident was further inflamed when Collingwood president Eddie McGuire said that Goodes should be used to promote the musical King King in Melbourne. Goodes,  the 2013 Australian Of The Year, went public over both incidents and earlier this year said McGuire's comments had ended their friendship. Two incidents of racial abuse were also reported at AFL matches last year, including one involving North Melbourne's Sudanese-born Majak Daw.

A Canadian teacher may have been cleared in a sexual assault case involving an ex-student, but her troubles are far from over as she looks to recover from a case that has cost her a job and her reputation. Mary Gowans, 43, of Toronto, had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students. The boy, now 18, testified that many of their encounters occurred while he was babysitting her five and nine-year-old children in 2009 and 2010. Cleared: Mary Gowans had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students . But a judge ruled on Friday that her alleged victim's inconsistent account of their sexual relationship caused the prosecution's case to collapse. She was found not guilty, but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student. 'I would have thought that her 17 years of teaching experience, she would have realized... he\u2019s spending a lot of time in her life. Alarm bells should have gone off,' McMahon said, according to the Toronto Star. More...

Appearing with her attorney outside the courthouse, Gowans said that she will now focus on fixing the mess her life has become since the allegations ruined her teaching career and her marriage. She said: \u2018Obviously I\u2019m very glad . this is over today. It has been a very very difficult week, and the last . three years of my life have unfortunately been destroyed as a result of . these allegations. Gowans . added: 'And I\u2019m glad it's over but at the same time I have the task of . rebuilding my life now.

Moving on: Gowans, pictured outside court on Friday, was found not guilty - but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student . The victim, who was not identified, had told the court that he couldn\u2019t have been making up the affair with Gowans because he knows she had breast implants and other intimate details about the 42-year-old mother. Gowans denied they had ever had an affair and claimed the teenager, now 18, had kissed her and grabbed her crotch in January 2010, after he had graduated from Joseph Howe Sr. Public School. Defense lawyers painted the . 18-year-old as a bright but arrogant teen who became \u2018obsessed\u2019 with his . teacher, who has since lost her job and separated from her husband of . 17 years. After the judge's verdict came down, the victim\u2019s family told the Toronto Star that they believe the teacher was lying. In court: She added that she took him home immediately and said he could not return to the house again . The teen\u2019s mother told the paper: 'We're disappointed with the verdict but we believe our son, and Ms Gowans can live with her lies.' During her testimony, Gowans recounted how her son and daughter were playing hide-and-seek at the home when she leaned in to the teen to reveal where her son was hiding. But to her surprise, he kissed her on the lips and grabbed her crotch, she said. 'It took a second to realize what was going on. Then, I pushed him back and said, \"What are you doing?

I felt he had taken advantage of my . kindness.' Accusations: The teenager, now 18, told the court they had at least four sexual encounters after his teacher took a liking to him. He admitted he had had sexual fantasies about her . In the dock: Gowans said he had become a member of the family and they regularly exchanged texts . She said she gathered herself and then told her children they were driving the boy home. The next day, after coaching the boy in hockey practice, she told him he would never return to her home. 'It never occurred to me to report him to the police. I thought the consequences like that didn\u2019t seem fitting,' she said.

Chris Christie made headlines last week when one of his aides admitted that he had surgery to lose weight. Christie said that the surgery had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with his health and his family. Christie said: \"It's not a career issue for me. It is a long-term health issue for me and that's the basis on which I made this decision. It's not about anything other than that.\" It is impossible to know whether we should take Christie at face value. Given that there has been ongoing speculation about his presidential aspirations for 2016, often coupled with discussions of his struggle with weight, it is certainly not unreasonable to wonder whether these are related. Why do Americans care about the weight of a candidate and why is appearance an issue in presidential elections? There is very little chance that the issue will go away. Certainly, old-fashioned bias has something to do with this concern. The willingness to ridicule obesity and make fun of appearances based on weight remains more acceptable than other kinds of biased comments that are no longer tolerated. One study by Yale University recently showed that male jurors were biased against heavy women, and more likely to find them guilty than leaner women. Some have called obesity the last acceptable bias in American life. Opinion: Congrats Gov. Christie - You saved your life . We are also in a political era when politicians are more in the public eye than ever before. Like it or not, appearance matters. When William Howard Taft -- weighing in at over 300 pounds -- was president, most Americans rarely saw him, though jokes about his weight still circulated. But it was still a very different world. In the early 20th century, there was no television or Internet broadcasting constant footage of the president in action. Other than the occasional still image in the newspaper, or the footage in the newsreels before movies until the 1940s, politics was still a medium of words and print. Since the emergence of television, however, we live in a visual political culture where appearances have become much more important. We vote based on what we see, or at least that is part of the calculation. It has become more important for presidents to convey the charisma of a John F. Kennedy and harder for those who are not as easy on the eye. Shallow visual preferences are not the only dynamic at work, however. The last half century has witnessed massive improvements in personal health. Americans are living longer and living better as a result of great advances in our understanding of nutrition and physical care. It is no longer uncommon for Americans to use a gym on a regular basis and to be much more cautious about what they eat. We expect politicians to live by the same standards. Indeed, we want our leaders to set examples for the rest of the nation. Christie is certainly not the only candidate to face these kinds of questions. When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency in 1992, the media covered his tendency to eat junk food on the campaign trail and his weight gains were treated as problematic. After Clinton gained 30 pounds during the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton noted, \"The good news is, my husband loves to eat and enjoys it. The bad news is, he loves to eat, even when things are not always right for him.\" Another reason that weight and other physical health concerns have become more important is that the job of the presidency has become much more demanding. As the role of the federal government has expanded at home and the presence of the United States overseas has intensified, there is much more for a president to handle on a daily basis. The massive size of the executive branch and intense 24-hour news cycle makes the presidency a physically brutal job. We often watch as presidents enter the White House looking young and spry, then exit with gray hair, tired and visibly worn down. As with many other high-powered jobs, physical health is important to the ability of a person to handle these kinds of tasks, so it is logical that these considerations enter into the conversation. All of this is to say that there are many reasons why voters and reporters will talk about Christie's weight, and why Christie's weight could become a major issue if he runs for president in 2016. It's important to note that there is some social science evidence that in certain cases voters may not be swayed by weight. In fact, according to one study, voters in certain cases can prefer obese to non-obese candidates. The studies showing this finding are still limited and, from the evidence of the presidential races of the past century, the signs still point to voters preferring candidates who are leaner. There is clearly a huge risk in making our decisions about leaders based on appearances, which really do tell us little about what a person would do when faced with the big challenges of the day. Regardless, the conversation is unlikely to subside, given the times in which we live. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer."}]}

Even though experts predict that turnout will not be particularly high, de Blasio's lead is so great that there is little to stop him from becoming Michael Bloomberg's successor. De Blasio got another boost of moral support from his daughter Chiara who surprised him Tuesday morning by flying to New York from her college in California in order to go to the polls with him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Surprise! Bill de Blasio got an election day present with his daughter Chiara making a surprise visit from her college in California to spend the day with her father and vote in his favor . Leading the way: Democratic candidate- and likely Mayor-elect- Bill de Blasio follows his daughter Chiara, wife Chirlane McCray and their son Dante out of their house in Park Slope as they head to the polls . New look: Ditching her trademark flower headband, Chiara opted for a more tribal print and a Bindi today . A Marist poll released on Monday had de Blasio leading Joe Lhota 65 per cent to 24 per cent among likely voters. \u2018There's only one poll that counts and it's the one that closes at 9pm,\u2019 Lhota said at a Monday campaign appearance. The campaign has been as much about the policies of Bloomberg, who leaves office at the end of the year after three terms, as the candidates' vision for the future. De Blasio frequently talks about the \u2018two New Yorks\u2019 - one rich, one poor - and how the city has left less fortunate New Yorkers behind as the contrast between the have's and have-not's has grown increasingly stark. De Blasio, who as the city's elected public advocate acts as an official watchdog, has positioned himself as a clean break with the Bloomberg years, promoting a sweeping liberal agenda that includes a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten and improved police-community relations. He has especially criticized the controversial police tactic of stop-and-frisk, which critics say unfairly targets poor blacks and Latinos. Who are you voting for? The proud father peers over at his daughter as she casts her vote . something to look forward to: The candidate's son Dante, 15, is too young to vote but accompanied his father and the rest of his family to their polling station in Park Slope . Bloomberg has called the approach . central to the city's anti-crime fight, while de Blasio has blasted it . as destructive to police and community relations. Those . campaign tactics, and a pledge to reach out to New Yorkers who feel . left behind by what they believed were Bloomberg's Manhattan-centric . policies, have been rewarded in the polls. Lhota, who has struggled to shake de Blasio's formidable lead, has launched an assault of negative ads. But that strategy has mostly backfired with an increasing number of voters saying they have a negative view of the Republican, Marist has found. Though registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts 6 to 1 across the city, the last Democrat to become mayor was David Dinkins in 1989. Last looks: Republican candidate Joe Lhota reviewed election documents with his wife in a Brooklyn station . Hoping for a comeback: Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani (left) campaigned with Joe Lhota (right) on the final day before the polls opened, as Lhota used to work for Giuliani . However, the GOP victories were tied to some extraordinary events that scrambled the political landscape. Mayor . Rudy Giuliani defeated Dinkins in 1993 amid fears about the city's . soaring crime rates, and Bloomberg won in 2001 largely thanks to his . fortune and the fallout from the September 11 attacks. Opponents have been counting down the days until Bloomberg's third term comes to a close, but for many months of the ensuing campaign, De Blasio did not seem like his likely successor. He was a distant fourth for much of the summer in the crowded Democratic primary, only to surge past former front-runners including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner, and is now on the verge of ending an improbable Republican winning streak in the mayor's office.

The bones were packaged and delivered to the Jewish community of Izmir, while the graves were removed from the tunnel. But archeologists believe they have not yet found the true extent of the burial site, which was still being used until the mid 19th Century. A letter requesting permission for the removal and transfer of the tombstones was submitted to the Ministry of Culture, as it is the main authority in the field. Jak Kaya, the Izmir Jewish Community President said that the bones will be reburied in the Altindag Jewish cemetery following a religious ritual. Mr Kaya said: 'The excavations are ongoing. Since there is a possibility that more bones can be found, we are suspending the burials until we are certain that all bones were collected. 'We know that this cemetery had been used during the 19th century. It was kept open for burials until the Republican period, after we started to use the Gurcesme and Altindag cemeteries.'

Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed . The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects.

As the ski season gets underway, thousands of tourists will be packing their bags and heading off to the Swiss Alps to enjoy themselves on the slopes. However, one man has taken a different approach and has instead spent his time six miles above the pistes capturing these stunning photographs. Using a rented aircraft, photographer Basti Hansen took shots of\u00a0 the magnificent mountains as few people will have seen them before. Basti Hansen used a rented aeroplane in order to capture these pictures from nearly four miles above the Alps highest peak, that of Monte Rosa . Hansen took the pictures from near Locarno, a small town of roughly 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore . Taking off from Locarno, a small town of 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore, he flew to 36,000ft before taking out his camera. At that height he would have passed four miles over the Swiss Alps' highest peak, that of Monte Rosa, which stands at just under three miles high. In one photograph he captures the mountain range, which covers around 65 per cent of Switzerland, bathed in golden sunlight. Cruising along at 36,000ft Hansen would have been able to easily pass over the highest mountain in Switzerland, Dom, which has a summit of just under 15,000ft . Down below the plane the Alps, which proved an impassable barrier to men and armies throughout history, look like miniature models . In several other pictures the snowy mountain tops can be seen poking through clouds which seem to flow through the steep valleys below. In one amazing shot the curvature of the Earth can even be seen above the peaks, with the sombre darkness of space across the top of the picture. While the ski season can start as early as November and last until May, most Swiss resorts open during December with skiing running through until April. Here the peaks of some of Switzerland's mountains can be seen jutting through the clouds which seem to fill the valleys in between them . Every year thousands of tourists take to the Swiss slopes on skiing holidays with the industry making up 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy . Tourism accounts for around 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy with some of the most popular destinations being Davos, Verbier and Valais. The highest mountain to lie entirely within Swiss borders is the Dom, which rises nearly 15,000ft and is the third highest in the Alps. The town of Locarno is small but steeped in history. Excavations from the region have found burial urns dating from the bronze age, around the 14th century BC.

Cesar, who was held responsible for a blunder in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as his side went out to the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, made two superb saves in the shootout as Brazil won its last 16 clash in a nail biting finale in Belo Horizonte. Several players, captain Thiago Silva and star player Neymar included, showed outward signs of emotion during the course of the match against Chile but Cesar told CNN that it was a natural reaction given the pressure of hosting the competition. \"We were in a situation where we could have been eliminated from the round of 16 in a World Cup in Brazil, so not only did I get emotional, but so did some of the other members of the team,\" he said. \"We know the importance of winning this World Cup in Brazil, not only for ourselves, but for our families, and especially for the fans. \"We don't know when Brazil will have another opportunity to host a World Cup, so I think we need to take advantage of this opportunity,\" added the 34-year-old. Despite his 84 caps, Cesar has had his critics and in the buildup to the World Cup finals spent an unhappy spell at English second-flight team Queens Park Rangers, before being farmed out on loan to MLS side Toronto. His place in the Brazil team appeared at risk, but Cesar credits coach Luiz Felipe Scolari with sticking with him despite his difficulties. \"I think it's the primary reason why I'm here today. Eight months ago he gave an interview saying that regardless if I was playing or not, I would playing at the World Cup. So this is something that gives you peace of mind,\" he added. Whether that peace of mind extends to the clash with Colombia and the prospect of preventing their goalscoring sensation James Rodriguez from adding to his competition leading tally of five goals is another matter. Rodriquez scored twice -- his first probably the goal of the tournament -- in his side's 2-0 last 16 win over Uruguay and Cesar admits he will be difficult to stop. \"James is a player that has been amazing everyone. I think that the World Cup gives players the opportunity to showcase their work to the world and I think James is making the most of it,\" he said. \"For now, though, I hope that against Brazil, he can halt his continued progression as a player until after the tournament has ended, because Brazil has to win.\" Brazil has its own trump card in Barcelona's Neymar, who has impressed Cesar with his mature performances despite carrying the hopes of a nation. \"You see a 22-year-old in his first World Cup in Brazil taking to the pitch as if he were playing with his friends in the street. In my opinion, that's his biggest strength,\" said Cesar. \"He's just like any other guy and I think his family is the main reason why he has accomplished so much, and yet remained humble. I think he's a fantastic kid.\" The last eight clash in Fortaleza could well hinge on which of the young superstars can put their imprint on the proceedings, while Cesar will be hoping to avoid the sort of error that haunted him during his last appearance at this stage of the competition four years ago."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- If you can define Ariel Sharon's legacy in one line, citing just one of his dramatic actions, then you have missed most of the man. The former Israeli prime minister led a life that looks much like the history of his country, filled with trauma, heartbreak, creativity, bloodshed and transformation. He aroused intense hatred from his enemies and profound admiration from his followers. He had strong opinions, took bold, risky actions. He made brilliant moves and disastrous mistakes. Sharon stood at the center of the greatest disputes, the most feverish controversies in the country's history. And then he stunned the world with a radical change of heart. The brazen right-wing hardliner remains a target of hatred for many in the Arab world. And yet, when he suffered a devastating stroke in 2006, he had undergone a breathtaking political conversion. Once a major proponent of the plan to build Jewish settlements in territories captured during the 1967 Six Day War, he had decided it was time for Israel to withdraw from much of the territory. As he told the New York Times' William Safire in 2004, he didn't believe the Palestinian leaders would respect a peace agreement, but he didn't want Israel to rule over millions of Palestinians. So, he said, \"I discussed this between me and myself and came up with a new initiative.\" Initially, nobody liked his idea very much. \"In Israel, the right does not like me to do it, and the left cannot do it,\" he said, \"but you don't wait forever.\" Despite bitter protests from his former allies and stiff resistance from the settlers, he carried out the \"Disengagement\" in 2005, removing every single settler and every Israeli soldier from the Gaza Strip. And he cryptically spoke of more \"painful compromises\" to come. \"We yearn for peace with our neighbors,\" he said to Israelis, \"even at the price of painful concessions.\" There is every reason to believe he was preparing to withdraw Israeli settlements from much of the West Bank, as well. Had Sharon stayed in office, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would look very different today. Sharon embodied the Israeli dilemma of how to obtain peace while maintaining security. As he had predicted years earlier, the withdrawal from Gaza ultimately turned the territory into a launching pad for attacks against Israeli towns. And yet, few Israelis wish their country still occupied the Strip. The larger-than-life prime minister helped his country survive in a deeply hostile region, where Israel's neighbors made it clear from the day the state was founded that they would find it the happiest of outcomes if the Jewish state would cease to exist. But he also drove Israel into terrible quagmires. Barely 20 years old in 1948, he sustained multiple injuries fighting in a war against half a dozen Arab countries, which attacked the moment Israel declared its independence. In 1973, when Egyptian and Syrian armies crossed into Israel on Yom Kippur, while much of the country was fasting for the calendar's holiest day, Israel appeared at risk of falling. Egyptian forces were headed for Tel Aviv. It was Sharon who devised and executed a plan to cross the Suez Canal, cut off and encircle part of the Egyptian army, a plan that helped Israel win the war and pave the road to peace. He suffered head injuries in battle but kept on fighting. Pictures of Sharon with his head bandaged while winning the war became iconic, a metaphor for a country battered, creative, resilient. He was the defense minister who carried out the withdrawal of all Israelis, including settlers, from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace with Egypt. The darkest, most destructive chapter in Sharon's life unfolded in Lebanon in 1982 when he was defense minister. It is by that chapter that most Arabs remember him. Back then, Israeli civilians were coming under constant attack from the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the PLO, which had become a state-within-a state inside Lebanon. Sharon launched an invasion to remove the PLO, allying Israeli forces with Lebanon's Christian militias, the Phalangists. Israeli forces allowed Phalangist fighters to enter the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla in Beirut to clear out Palestinian militias. Instead, the Phalangists committed horrific massacres of civilians. Contrary to what many believe, Sharon had no knowledge that the massacres would occur. An Israeli commission of inquiry found that despite previous excesses by the Christian militias, Israel had concluded that Phalangist forces had reached a stage of maturity that would \"ensure that such actions would not repeat themselves.\" Given the sectarian passions, it was reckless to allow the Christian militias into the camp. The Israeli inquiry headed by the country's President of the Supreme Court, the Kahan Commission, found Sharon bore \"personal responsibility\" and recommended his removal from office. Israelis were seething at him and their government. He rejected the charges and refused to step down. Israeli peace activists launched protests to push for his removal. When a hand grenade was detonated in one demonstration, killing an Israeli protester, Sharon finally stepped down. Eventually, Sharon rose again. He had never cared much what people thought about him and was never one to follow ideological fashion. That was probably a result of his childhood. When he was born in 1928, his parents had settled in a socialist farming community, but rejected their neighbors' views on communal living. Sharon and his family were outsiders in their own home. He learned to think for himself and follow his instincts rather than the crowd. He had reached the height of his career in 2006 when it suddenly ended from a massive stroke that put him in a coma. Before his illness, Sharon had found a new path. He broke with his rightist party, the Likud, in a rift that put him on the opposite side of other hardline stalwarts such as today's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sharon created the Kadima (forward) party ahead of elections he was poised to win in a landslide. When he was incapacitated, Kadima won. His deputy Ehud Olmert became prime minister and carried on with peace talks, which ultimately foundered. Sharon had hand-picked Tzipi Livni to join him in Kadima. She is now a leading advocate of concessions for peace and member of Israel's negotiating team. Despite his missteps, Israelis trusted Sharon as a strong defender of their security. That meant that when he was prepared to take risks for peace, they were ready to join him. That's why he won elections while vowing to undertake \"painful compromises.\" That's why it was so demoralizing when he suddenly left the stage. Israelis, including Netanyahu, know that peace will not be possible without some risk-taking. The question is the extent of the danger they are prepared to accept. His life showed the complex link between security, peace and politics. And he showed once again that it is often the fiercest warriors who take risks for peace. It was another Israeli right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, who made peace with Egypt. It was Yitzhak Rabin, a respected general, who shook hands with Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. It was Sharon, an architect of the settler movement, who said settlements had to be removed. He left a complicated legacy, defending his country from those who would destroy it, and taking on those who disagreed with his controversial views at home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis ."}]}

A man wanted for questioning over a burglary at an antiques shop has fled Britain and become a rep for the firm behind the now infamous Magaluf sex video, it was claimed today. Lloyd Trainer, 24, featured on the BBC's Crimewatch less than a month ago in connection with a high-value raid on a shop in Petworth, West Sussex, in January 2012. Police said he had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island. And two days after he was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow on June 12, he posted a photo of himself smiling in a bar. According to The Sun, Trainer has been herding teenagers round the holiday resort of Magaluf for Carnage, the firm behind the now notorious sex video which was leaked online last week. A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Lloyd Trainer, 24, from Surrey, is wanted for a high value burglary from an antiques shop in Petworth in January 2012. He has been wanted by police since then.' A source told the newspaper that Trainer had been 'bragging about how he has been on Crimewatch, showing people clips from the show on his phone'. The video shows 24 men receiving a sex act from an 18-year-old woman who was reportedly promised a 'free holiday' - which turned out to be the name of a cheap cocktail. It prompted horror and outrage from thousands of people on Twitter, where the firm initially revelled in the publicity. The @carnagemagalluf Twitter account, which has posted photos of teenagers slumped on the floor and others with the hashtag #exvirgin, retweeted dozens of compliments and insults about the video as publicity mounted. Boozy: Brits take part in a Carnage barcrawl yesterday. The reaction to the video does not appear to have impacted on the firm's popularity, with hundreds of people still hitting the resort's famous strip for cheap drinks . Its organisers then wrote: 'We are not responsible for the girl's actions. The girl and her eight friends bought tickets for the next barcrawl as they said it was amazing! 'All you . need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk . and knows what she is doing. Definitely not forced in any way.' But . a friend of the woman in the video, from Northern Ireland, claimed she . was a born-again Christian who had 'made a terrible mistake'. The footage was described by . many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were regulated for the . first time this year following years of complaints by locals. Spanish mayor Manu Onieva . voiced his \u2018absolute indignation\u2019 and said police were investigating the . practice that local press have dubbed \u2018mamading\u2019 \u2013 a play on the crude . Spanish word for a sex act, \u2018mamada\u2019. Wanted for questioning: Sussex Police said Lloyd Trainer had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island . Despite the outrage, Carnage barcrawls attract hundreds of participants - with more than 400 people, many teenagers on their first holiday without their parents, on one recent event alone. The firm is not linked to Carnage UK, a separate barcrawl firm which has also made headlines. Benefits Street's 'White Dee', real name Deirdre Kelly, was a guest . of Carnage Magalluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing the . company\u2019s T-shirt. And Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, claimed the participants had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture."}]}

A confidential report from the Pentagon revealed that plans for over two dozen United States weapons systems were stolen by Chinese hackers.The hackers, who are reportedly employed by the Chinese government to help advance their military system, have been a growing threat for some time now.Amongst the systems stolen were those critical to US missile defenses for Europe, Asia, and the Gulf, and combat aircrafts and ships. Chinese hackers stole plans for confidential United States weapons systems including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pictured here . The report prepared by the Defense Science Board went on to say that the hacking of US weapons systems by the Chinese poses major risks, according to The Washington Post.These risks include giving China a strategic advantage in future combat against the US. The theft of government weapon plans also allows China to save billions in development funds, while simultaneously advancing their systems in great strides. China denied the cyber-theft charges . made in the report, but President Obama is expected to bring up the . issue when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.Among the weapons compromised were the advanced Patriot missile system known as PAC-3 and the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems. Plans for combat aircrafts including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were also stolen along with the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship, designed to patrol waters close to shore.The report did not state the exact extent of the cyber-thefts or specify whether they came from computer networks belonging to the US government, or their contractors and subcontractors. Government officials say that the weapons system plans stolen by Chinese hackers could comprise future United States military revenuers. A V-22 Osprey pictured here is among the aircrafts for which plans were stolen . United States officials have had growing concerns about Chinese hacking tactics for sometime. A spokesman for the Pentagon told the newspaper in an e-mail, 'The Department of Defense has growing concerns about the global threat to economic and national security from persistent cyber-intrusions aimed at the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and commercial data, which threatens the competitive edge of U.S. businesses like those in the Defense Industrial Base.'A public version of Defense Science Board's report noted that the recent cyber-thefts could have 'severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat.'Amongst those consequences are severing US forces' communication, data corruption, weapons failures, and possible plane, satellite, and drone crashes.'If they got into the combat systems, it enables them to understand it to be able to jam it or otherwise disable it,\u201d Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight told The Post. 'If they\u2019ve got into the basic algorithms for the missile and how they behave, somebody better get out a clean piece of paper and start to design all over again.' Chinese hackers allegedly associated with the country's government stole United States missile plans for weapons such as Patriot missile batteries (pictured here) Attempts are being made by the Pentagon to combat the escalating cyber-espionage. The government launched a program two years ago which helps defense contractors strengthen their computer firewalls. The program allows independent companies to use classified data from the National Security Agency to scan their networks for malware.However, the Chinese hackers have found ways to adapt and now are shifting their focus towards government subcontractors.The Pentagon is currently expanding their computer defense programs to respond to these new threats. In addition, independent contractors are also beginning to take precautions to prevent hacking. An official from Lockheed Martin, a top defense contractor said the company is 'spending more time helping deal with attacks on the supply chain,' of subcontractors, the Post reported. 'For now, our defenses are strong enough to counter the threat,' the official continued, 'and many attackers know that, so they go after suppliers. But of course they are always trying to develop new ways to attack.'"}]}

Au naturelle: Victoria Beckham is thought to have chosen teardrop-shaped implants for her second operation . Evolutionary theorists call them \u2018sexual ornaments\u2019. According to\u00a0 academics, the human female bosom is unique among primates. While ape species have large breasts only during lactation, the same isn\u2019t true for us. And as they remain after menopause, they are not an indicator of fertility. So, look away now feminists... the way they look mainly serves to attract a mate. Thus, women have always drawn attention to their busts with padding, corsetry, or simply by going topless. Today, the boob job is the most . commonly performed cosmetic surgery, with more than 10,000 British women . having one last year. And as The Mail on Sunday reported last week, British breast implant manufacturer Nagor claim one in ten patients now opts for a \u2018super boob job,\u2019 increasing their bust by four or more cup sizes in a single operation. However, many women still want a more discreet option dubbed the \u2018has she or hasn\u2019t she\u2019 boob job. Miles . Berry, a plastic surgeon and co-author of the Good Boob Bible, says: . \u2018Victoria Beckham epitomises the new trend. 'She has never admitted to . surgery, but pictures show\u00a0 her breasts are incredibly supple and full \u2013 . better than in her youth.\u2019 Despite . technological and surgical advances, there are still pitfalls when . trying to choose the perfect pair. Here, experts advise how to get it . just right. IGNORE CUP SIZE . Size . is dictated by the volume of the implant and measured in cubic . centimetres (a 151cc to 250cc implant will give around a one to two-cup . size increase). If you are looking for a natural-looking boob job, . consultant plastic surgeon Patrick Mallucci\u00a0 recommends forgetting about . cup size altogether. \u2018Don\u2019t . come in saying, \u201cI am a B and I\u2019d like to be a DD\u201d. Cup size is highly . subjective. I might see 20 women measuring 34C, all with completely . different breasts,\u2019 he explains. Ultimately you want a breast which is . in proportion and the right implant that will achieve that. THE PERFECT SHAPE . In . 2011, Mallucci analysed the mathematical factors of attractive breasts, . using 100 Page 3 models, all of whom had real breasts, as research . material. The resulting . formula revealed a template for both surgeons and women considering . surgery: 45 per cent of breast volume is above the nipple; the nipple . points upwards at an average angle of 20 degrees; the upper half is . either straight or concave, and the lower half a neat, full curve. Back in the days: There was no mistaking that Victoria Beckham had a boob job eight years ago, but later had her 'chest oranges', right, swapped for a more natural looking implant . Mallucci says: \u2018The dimensions are a template, whether you are simply enlarging or lifting as well.\u2019 That said, the desire is normally to have bigger breasts. If you want a natural-looking boob job which is aesthetically ideal, there are limitations depending on your frame and anatomy. \u2018The surgeon ought to measure the width of your breast to select the implant size,\u2019 he says. Too big a width means the implant shows on top of the rib cage. \u2018As long as you stick to this rule you are close to achieving the perfect shape. Too large will never look natural.\u2019 PROJECT YOURSELF . \u2018Projection, or pertness, of the breasts is down to the shape of the implant itself,\u2019 says consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah. \u2018There are different silhouettes \u2013 low, medium, high or extra-high.\u2019 \u2018The patient\u2019s physiology must be taken into account. A 20-year-old with a flat chest couldn\u2019t have an extra high projection as the skin would be too stretched,\u2019 Fatah adds. \u2018Under-filling is equally disastrous as it will make the skin sag around the implant,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018Post-pregnancy, you may have a deflated breast. The more skin laxity, the more projection is necessary.\u2019 Another important consideration is breast tissue and skin quality. \u2018Older or post-pregnancy skin\u00a0 may be very thin,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018You don\u2019t want the implant to\u00a0 show underneath.\u2019 ROUNDING UP . A round shape accounts for 82 per cent of implants in Britain. The other option is a teardrop-shaped implant. Fazel Fatah explains: \u2018The round implant looks fuller at the top, while the teardrop slopes downwards like a natural breast. \u2018Not many people have the teardrop because the surgical technique has to be very precise to avoid the implant rotating within the breast. It takes longer in theatre and the implant itself costs more, so the option is more expensive.\u2019 There can be a \u00a31,000 difference. Popular op: More than 10,000 British women had plastic surgery on their chest last year . TRY BEFORE YOU BUY . Some surgeons offer 3D imaging, but usually surgeons suggest \u2018trying out\u2019 new breasts by wearing a larger bra filled with an implant. \u2018British women want fullness at the top, or the Wonder-Bra effect,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018But if the breasts stay that shape when naked, they\u2019ll look a bit weird. This means limiting volume in the upper bust. You can still wear an enhancing bra afterwards.\u2019 SAFETY FIRST . \u2018Women should be as informed as possible about exactly what goes into their bodies,\u2019 says consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Michael Cadier. The most important factor is not the type of implant, but the safety record. European legislation isn\u2019t particularly stringent, but the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved five brands of implant. \u2018Should your surgeon not suggest one with FDA approval then there ought to be good safety data demonstrated in the form of long-term clinical follow-ups of a minimum of five years, looking at the integrity of the implant and effects on the body,\u2019 says Berry. A BOOB JOB IS FOR LIFE . \u2018The body forms scar tissue around the implant. This fibrous bag usually starts to contract after a decade, and the breast may look unnatural. If it becomes unevenly shaped it may have ruptured,\u2019 says Berry. However, as long as you have a decent implant there are no serious concerns should this happen. \u2018Women often only find out about rupture when they go for a mammogram at 50,\u2019 he adds. Once you know they\u2019re broken, they ought to be removed. Many women need reductions too. \u2018This is why a size eight woman wanting to have massive breasts is going to be in trouble,\u2019 says Fatah. \u2018The breast tissue will be very thin and when they are replaced she may be left with sagging breasts.\u2019"}]}

The bill, which passed in a 64-34 vote, cleared the Republican-run House of Representatives last week. It now advances to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. While the measure suspends Washington's $16.4 trillion debt ceiling through May 19, some budget analysts estimate it will give the U.S. Treasury the ability to meet all federal spending obligations through at least the end of July. In exchange for temporarily suspending the debt ceiling, the bill requires lawmakers in both chambers of Congress to pass a budget by mid-April or have their pay withheld. The requirement was added at the insistence of congressional Republicans, who wanted to highlight the failure of Senate Democrats to pass a budget resolution since 2009. Democrats note that such resolutions are not binding, and insist they would have been superseded by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which established budgetary restrictions for the last two fiscal years. Top Capitol Hill Democrats have been divided over the bill. Some railed against the pay withholding provision -- calling it a political gimmick -- while others supported the measure as a whole because it removes an immediate threat of default and at least temporarily divorces the debt ceiling from GOP spending cut demands. For their part, top Republicans have essentially conceded that a fight over raising the debt ceiling is not the best political avenue for achieving their twin deficit and spending reduction goals. Most political analysts believe that a 2011 debt ceiling fight, which led to the passage of the Budget Control Act, did not play to the GOP's political advantage. That partisan fight led to a downgrade in the gold-plated U.S. credit rating and was thought to have slowed the fragile economic recovery. Beyond the debt ceiling, the House and Senate will be forced to grapple shortly with two other polarizing budget-related deadlines. If Congress fails to act by March 1, a pending sequester will trigger roughly $1 trillion in new defense and non-defense cuts over the next decade -- cuts generally disliked on both sides of the aisle. In addition, federal funding for the current fiscal year is currently set to expire on March 27, forcing a government shutdown unless Congress can agree on at least a new temporary spending package.

It will come as welcome news to those who have overindulged over the Christmas period. Scientists have invented an edible gel that swells in the stomach and produces a feeling of fullness. The substance is believed to be difficult to digest - leaving the person feeling less hungry and so reducing their desire to snack or overeat. Discovery: Scientists have discovered a way of forming an edible gel that and produces a feeling of fullness . The researchers at the University of Birmingham made the discovery while combining various food ingredients, according to The Sunday Telegraph. The ingredients - derived from seaweed, starch and citrus peel - form water soluble gums that can be utilized as normal food thickeners. They are frequently used in molecular gastronomy by acclaimed British chefs, such as Heston Blumenthal. However, when exposed to stomach . acid, the ingredients start to swell and combine together to form a solid gel, according to the research published in the journal Food Hydrocolloids. Benefits: The substance is believed to leave a person feeling less hungry and so reduces their desire to snack . Scientists are now hoping to develop the substance so it can be incorporated into everyday foods. Project leader Jennifer Bradbeer said the discovery could help tackle Britain's obesity crisis - with a staggering 64 per cent of UK adults now classed as obese or overweight. 'One way of tackling the high and rising levels of . morbid obesity in today\u2019s society is to control the consumer\u2019s energy . intake from foods,' she told the newspaper. 'One problem is that foods have become softer, more easily digestible and therefore less satiating. 'This leads to the individual feeling hungry more quickly and subsequently wanting to eat again, often between meals.' She said that the gel - made of hydrocolloids that respond to the stomach's highly acidic conditions - could be one means of curbing a person's cravings for snacks. However, she added that while the gel alone could provide 'prolonged satiety', it would result in 'unpleasant sensations' if lacking the energy provided by food. More than 1.4billion people across the world are now classed as obese or overweight, according to a recent study by the Overseas Development Institute. People who are classed in these categories are at greater risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, diabetes and other health-related issues."}]}

Lee Towsey claims two undercover officers, who were themselves investigating abuse claims, sexually assaulted him at the Elm Guest House in South-West London. The guesthouse is at the centre of a police investigation looking into allegations that young boys were abused by Westminster politicians, judges, pop stars and a member of the Royal household. Scroll down for video . Two former police officers are being investigated over claims they sexually abused a former child actor at the Elm Guest House in South-West London, above, which was frequented by VIPs and politicians . Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as \u2018the tip of the iceberg\u2019 The new revelation comes amid a flood of serious allegations, including that police covered up the name of an MP who abused a child at the former guesthouse. Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as \u2018the tip of the iceberg\u2019. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in April, Mr Towsey said he had sex with two officers who were gaining intelligence on the guesthouse prior to the June 1982 raid. Mr Towsey worked as a masseur at the guesthouse but was 16 at the time of the offences, which was under the age of homosexual consent then. He said: \u2018The first came in April and I had sex with him. \u2018He turned out to be one of the officers who later raided the house. \u2018He came back about three weeks later and hired a room. He stayed two nights and on the second night his partner stayed too. \u2018I ended up having sex with them. Afterwards they asked me \u201chow much\u201d and I told them that they were not clients and I felt insulted they wanted to pay me.\u2019 Mr Towsey, who appeared in Grange Hill and Doctor Who, was taken to Richmond police station after the raid, where, he claims, he saw the second officer. Metropolitan Police detectives launched the investigation after Mr Towsey reported the allegations to police in early 2013. It referred the matter the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), but the watchdog decided not to investigate and sent the case back to the Met. The Met\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards is now leading the investigation, Operation Yvonne, into the former officers, who were police constables at the time of the alleged offence. Scotland Yard has refused to release their names. After the raid the guesthouse owners, Harry and Carole Kasir, were convicted of keeping a disorderly house and having obscene videos. They were given a two-year suspended sentence and fined \u00a31,000. Ordeal: How The Mail on Sunday revealed in April that Lee Towsey had been abused as a teenager by police officers at the Elm Guest house . Mr Towsey\u2019s lawyer said police had now asked his client to provide a further statement about the claims. Nigel Fisher, of Fletcher Day solicitors, said: \u2018We are pleased police have now officially launched an investigation into the events. \u2018It is an important step in taking Lee\u2019s case further. Police have asked Lee to give a further statement which he is doing in the next couple of weeks.\u2019 Operation Yvonne is the latest off-shoot from Operation Fernbridge, which is looking into claims children were abused at the former guest house, which is now a row of flats.Police have already confirmed the disgraced former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, who Mr Towsey said was one of his clients, was a visitor. Police are probing allegations VIPs preyed on boys who were brought to the guesthouse in Rocks Lane, Barnes, from a nearby children\u2019s home. It has also been suggested that police or security services covered up the name of a politician who allegedly abused a child taken into custody the night of the raid. A social worker who was at the police station claimed details of the boy\u2019s account were left out of his police statement. The social worker said that the boy had spoken of a man called \u2018Uncle XXXXX\u2019 and that the man worked \u2018at the big houses\u2019 \u2013 the Houses of Parliament. However references to both \u2018Uncle XXXXX\u2019 and the Houses of Parliament were left out of what should have been a verbatim account of his statement. Simon Danczuk MP, who spoke to Mr Towsey after it emerged that Cyril Smith was a regular visitor to the guesthouse, said: \u2018These latest allegations are very worrying and suggest that the awful experiences young lads had to endure there were compounded by a botched police investigation. \u2018If we\u2019re going to uncover the truth of what happened at Elm Guest House it\u2019s vital that the role of the police in investigating these criminal activities is examined thoroughly.\u2019 As well as Operation Fernbridge, the Met has a number of active investigations into VIP-related child abuse ongoing. Operation Fairbank is looking into claims a paedophile ring had links to Westminster, while Operation Midland is looking into explosive claims boys were abused and even killed by Conservative politicians at Dolphin Square, a block of flats in Pimlico, London. The Home Office, which came under fire for losing a dossier of alleged abuses given by Geoffrey Dickens to former Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983, is conducting a public inquiry into historic abuse. A Met police spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm that allegations of historical sexual abuse against two former officers, alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, were passed to the IPCC for its consideration. It referred the matter back to the Met for local department of professional standards investigation.\u2019 A spokesman for the IPCC said a senior investigator assessed the available information and decided the force should continue with its own investigation. The spokesman said: \u2018We asked the force to refer the matter again if any evidence was found that may merit this decision being reconsidered.\u2019 ... and new probe launched into child sex abuse at Jonathan King disco . A police probe into a celebrity paedophile ring, which led to the convictions of pop mogul Jonathan King and DJ Chris Denning, has been sensationally reopened, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. An independent report into Surrey Police\u2019s high-profile investigation into the Walton Hop disco has found the original operation did not fully explore all lines of inquiry. Convicted: Walton Hop DJ Jonathan King; but police are now looking at what may have been missed during their original investigation . Surrey\u2019s Operation Arundel, which ran for six years from 2000, centred on the disco in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey where King and Chris Denning picked up victims in the 1970s and 80s . Surrey\u2019s Operation Arundel, which ran for six years from 2000, centred on the disco in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey where King and Denning picked up victims in the 1970s and 80s. Visitors to the disco are understood to have included a string of celebrities \u2013 including pop stars and famous TV personalities. King, 70, ex-Radio 1 star Chris Denning, 73, and Robert Randall, a DJ at the disco, were prosecuted. Several well-known figures were arrested but not charged, including TV presenter Matthew Kelly and former Bay City Rollers manager Tam Paton. Now it can be revealed that an independent report by Merseyside Police to \u2018establish whether there were any further investigative lines of enquiry\u2019 identified a number of actions, which Surrey Police said they \u2018are now progressing\u2019. The new operation, codenamed Ravine, will draw on information from the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Yewtree. Last month, Yewtree detectives secured the conviction of Denning on 40 charges against boys aged from nine to 16 in the 1970s and 1980s. He is due to be sentenced next week. No arrests have been made and police have asked anyone with information to come forward."}]}

Olympia Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting, it's her principles and constituents that guide her, not her party. Sen. Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections. Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is \"not new behavior for her.\" \"I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,\" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been \"naturally independent\" \"Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,\" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, \"becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,\" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her \"the caretaker.\" \"Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,\" the article read. \"But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents.\" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, \"They would probably both lose re-election.\" Part of the so-called \"Gang of Six\" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. \"I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,\" she told NPR last week. \"I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges.\" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or \"trigger,\" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate \u00bb . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. \"This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,\" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. \"What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,\" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. \"Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,\" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a \"matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy.\" CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Henry and Mark Preston contributed to this report."}]}

Nicole Scherzinger, Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba and Rihanna have all since sported the trend. And next year it will gain 70,000 new followers as all London Olympics volunteers will be kitted out in a 'regal purple' and 'poppy red' jacket. Sparking a trend: Cheryl Cole's orange and purple outfit, which she wore in May, may have inspired the London Olympics volunteer's uniforms . The uniforms, which will be worn by 'Games Makers' at the London 2012 Games, were unveiled yesterday . They were created by a London 2012 and adidas design team and are apparently a throwback to the historic Grenadier Guards uniform - note the epaulettes and the buttons on the sleeves. Classic British sporting events such as the London 1948 Games, Wimbledon tennis championships and the Henley Regatta provided additional inspiration. But the design team also seem to have taken into account the latest fashion trends. London 2012 chief executive Paul . Deighton said of the volunteers: 'They will be high profile in London and in our venues . across the UK at Games time and so it's important they look the part.' The jacket has a turn-back feature to suit different arm lengths and different-coloured epaulettes will . identify specific groups, with white for medical staff, red for team . leaders and green for anti-doping personnel. Games Makers: Volunteers reveal the various uniforms which will be worn at the Olympics . The uniform will be worn by volunteers at both the Olympics and the Paralympics. Only the logo on the jacket, the hat and T-shirt will change depending on which games the person is working at. All will be given the beige trousers and the grey trainers with red laces.

Each Technical Official uniform will . come with jacket, pair of trousers and skirt for women, a shirt, a belt . and a laptop-sized bag. A trilby hat and a tie tops off the men's kit while there is a scarf for women technical officials. An effort has been made to make the uniforms sustainable to fit in with the Games' ethos. Loud and proud: Kim Kardashian (left) and Nicole Scherzinger are also fans on the colour combination . The polo shirt is made of 100 per cent recycled polyester, as is the jacket shell, while the outer and inner lining consists of partly recycled polyester, along with the trousers. Sustainable materials have also been used in the bag and water bottle. Deighton said: 'What we've come up with is a uniform which celebrates the best of Britain's heritage in a modern and sustainable way. 'Delivering the Games is hard work and so the uniform needs to be functional. However we also want our teams to wear it with pride. We showed it to them this morning and the response was incredibly enthusiastic.' Games Makers will start picking up their uniforms from April 2012."}]}

And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. \"It will morph, and new leaders will emerge,\" retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks said. \"In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders.\" Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. \"ISIS likely has a clear line of succession,\" said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. \"This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession.\" Top two deputies . Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. \"These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal,\" said Peter Neumann of King's College. \"But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies.\" Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. \"He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender,\" Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility . Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. \"He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.,\" Squires said. The Shura Council's importance . If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. \"The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,\" said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. \"It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence.\" She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will generate concise, entity-dense summary of the given article. Only generate the summary text. Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Earlier this week scientists were left baffled by a huge feature that surfaced in the seas of Titan that measured a staggering 100 square miles (260sq km) - the size of Washington DC or the city of Birmingham in the UK. And in the latest speculation a number of theories have been considered including a giant iceberg and a huge field of bubbles. Speaking to MailOnline, two scientists explained their thoughts on what it might have been and that they hope to learn more upon repeated observations early next year. In this series of images from the Cassini spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in size is seen rising out of one of Titan's largest seas before disappearing again. In the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface . In July 2013 the giant feature was seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again in August this year. Regarding the iceberg theory one scientist explains how, if it's the correct assumption, they might differ to icebergs on Earth. 'For a bit of background, on Earth it's quite a simple situation because ice floats in water,' Jason Hofgartner, a graduate student at Cornell University who works on the Cassini Radar Science Team, tells MailOnline. 'On Titan it's more complicated because you have a methane and ethane mixture, we think, and there's nitrogen from the atmosphere that also gets dissolved. The iceberg theory is one of the more favoured ones at the moment. This suggests some frozen mass, perhaps frozen methane and ethane, was dislodged from the seabed and rose to the surface. Another theory is that this may be a vast field of bubbles released by underground vents of volcanoes that are now resting on the surface. It could also be surface waves drifting across the sea, although this theory is unlikely as Titan is tidally locked to Saturn (the same face also points towards the planet) so its seas to not have tides as dramatic as those seen on Earth. One theory that that has been ruled out is that this is a land mass. Jason Hofgartner from Cornell University says if it was it would have been visible under the liquid in the previous images. 'So when you freeze it, it undergoes complicated composition changes. 'Whether you can get icebergs that can float is a matter for debate, but it's possible. 'When it warms those icebergs could switch from sinking to floating.' Hofgartner explains how the northern hemisphere, where the iceberg was spotted, is currently transitioning from spring time to summer. This process might be responsible for warming the sub-surface icebergs, which then caused them to rise from the seabed. Other processes like currents in the sea could also be dislodging such features. Another theory is that it is a bubble, although not necessarily a giant bubble across the whole feature. Hofgartner says it could be a series of smaller bubbles spread over the huge area, each perhaps just centimetres in size. The cause of these bubbles could be vents, undersea volcanoes or  seasonal changes. One theory that can be ruled out, however, is that this is some sort of giant non-ice land mass that has risen from the depths. This is because the radar system on Cassini can penetrate into the liquid so it would have spotted such a land mass. 'If this was a land mass or mud flat under the sea, we should have seen it in earlier images because the radar would have penetrated,' he explains. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 (left) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in the region of interest.\u00a0The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. On the right is an image of Titan in orbit around Saturn . Another feature of the images is that the object appears to be fading. 'I don't know if that's anything to do with what's under the liquid; we see it's decreased in brightness an extending. 'So what could be happening is it's spreading out and becoming less concentrated in one area, and spreading into a larger area.' The feature is certainly rare, although it's possible that more may be spotted in future. This specific area will be imaged by radar again early in 2015, and exactly what state the feature is in will surely be of huge interest. One of Nasa's future proposals to Titan is for a boat to sail the seas, but Hofgartner says features like this would not necessarily be a threat to such a mission. 'Perhaps the boat could help us nail down what is happening here,' he says. This is an artist's impression of the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) capsule, a proposed mission to perform the first direct inspection of an ocean environment beyond Earth by landing in, and floating on, a methane-ethane sea on Saturn\u2019s largest moon: Titan . Speaking to MailOnline Professor of Planetary Plasma Physics Emma Bunce from the University of Leicester, who also works on the Cassini mission, agreed that it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on Earth. 'It could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface,' she says. 'I was thinking almost like an iceberg, similar to something in Earth's oceans.' But she doesn't rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble, or even surface waves. She goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at Saturn. The first image in 2007 was taken 'around Saturn equinox [when the sun is above the equator], and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on Saturn. 'That's sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the Cassini results; a lot of things depend on the season at Saturn as it moves in orbit. 'Because this lake itself is actually near to Titan's northern pole, perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions.' The feature was spotted in Ligeia Mare (shown), one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar experiment.\u00a0Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa . The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. It was spotted in Ligeia Mare, one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar instrument. In images from 10 July 2013 to 21 August 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's 'water' is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region. The mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images, suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image. This supports one theory that it may be a solid structure  that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason. The dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on Titan's surface, while the bright area to the right is land. Scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data. They have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation, as the nearby shoreline has not changed much. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa. The appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on Titan, with summer drawing near in the moon's northern hemisphere. Monitoring these changes is a major goal of Cassini's current extended mission. 'Science loves a mystery, and with this enigmatic feature, we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on Titan,' said Dr Stephen Wall, the deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what's going on in that alien sea.' It's not just Titan that is thought to have an active surface; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth - Europa. Experts from the University of Idaho and the Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, say Europa could be more Earth-like than experts imagined. The latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists. It shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding. Many parts of Europa's surface show evidence of extension, where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart, and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap, a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Europa's surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics. It has been a decade since Cassini entered orbit around Saturn (illustration shown). In June the Cassini mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet, its rings and moons. It arrived for a four-year mission but has since been continuously extended, although it will almost certainly end in 2017 ."}]}

That contentious tome: Dr. Seuss' \"Hop on Pop.\" Although it's unclear whether the removal request was filed by an actual Grinch or intended in jest, the complaint stated that the book should be removed because it \"encourages children to use violence against their fathers.\" The complaint further demanded that fathers be apologized to and reimbursed for any damages arising from children's reading of the book. According to Vickery Bowles, the director of collections management, the Toronto Public Library has a system for processing requests to remove books from its collection, though fewer than 100 have been filed since 2000. Of those, only five were actually removed \"because they contained inaccurate or dated information.\" Among them was a children's book on dairy farming that had outdated farming information. Former first lady Laura Bush outlined the potential for violence in 2006. She said her children, when very small, actually took the book to literally mean they should jump on their father. President George W. Bush was reportedly uninjured in the incident. In addressing the complaint, the library pointed out that the book is included on many \"best of\" lists for children and that Dr. Seuss is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. However, one particular argument was probably the death knell for this request: \"The children are actually told not to hop on Pop.\" The only words uttered by the eponymous Pop in the 390-word title are an admonition to refrain from such activity: \"STOP. You must not hop on Pop.\" The request was officially denied, and \"Hop on Pop\" remains in the library's collection."}]}

A teenage girl was today branded one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous women - after she mauled and beat a man to death when her cannabis smoking made her believe he was possessed by the devil. Tinika Campbell, then 17, sank her teeth into the head of 36-year-old Khalid Kassian Hassan in a flat in Longsight, Manchester, then punched him repeatedly after harbouring a deranged belief he was about to mount a demonic attack upon her. She also set her pit bull dog on Mr Hassan when he tried to run from her clutches. Police were then called to the home after neighbours heard Mr Hassan \u2018screaming for help\u2019. Officers found Campbell kneeling astride him in the doorway, head-butting Iraqi-born Mr Hassan and calling him a \u2018dirty b******\u2019. As officers attempted to tend to his mutilated body, Campbell briefly paused her assault before she stamped on his face and then used the pit bull to ward off police while she fled. The teenager then broke into a nearby office and barricaded herself inside using furniture to block the door. But she was arrested 20 minutes later when police were forced to overpower her with a Taser weapon, during the terrifying siege in the early hours of August 31, 2012. When Campbell was transferred to nearby Longsight Police Station, she began \u2018roaring\u2019 and talking about God in her cell - before she bit into the hand of an officer and refused to let go. Mr Hassan died at the scene. When his body was examined the pathologist discovered a catalogue of injuries including a fractured nose, four fractured ribs, bruises and cuts to his head and face, a broken neck bone and severe injuries to his left leg consistent with dog bites. Investigation: Police outside the house in Longsight, Manchester, where the attack happened in August 2012. Officers found Campbell kneeling astride him in the doorway, head-butting her victim in the face . He had also suffered several bites from a human on his head and left hand. At Manchester Crown Court it was revealed that Campbell was suffering from schizoaffective disorder exacerbated by her frequent use of cannabis and legal high drugs. It led to abnormal beliefs in which she thought everyone was possessed by the devil. Details of the case emerged as Campbell, now 19, was given a life sentence and branded \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 after she admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She will have to serve a minimum jail term of five years after her not guilty plea to murder was accepted. She already had 18 convictions for 27 offences, including assault and robbery. Neil Usher, prosecuting, said: \u2018She said she couldn\u2019t trust anybody. She told a doctor at stage during the early hours she had took the dog for a walk. \u2018She insisted she had not gone for the purposes of killing. She had wandered the streets and found herself at his address by chance. \u2018Then she said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself. Shocking incident: Campbell was arrested when police were forced to overpower her with a Taser weapon . \u2018This led to the attack. She has continued to experience delusional thoughts and violence and other challenging behaviour. Her condition is exacerbated by the effects of illicit psychotic drugs including cannabis.\u2019 As well as hearing Mr Hassan\u2019s futile screams for mercy, neighbours reported Campbell telling her dog to \u2018sick him\u2019 and \u2018get him\u2019 when they contacted the police. The court heard that in the days before . the attack Campbell, who had been in care since the age of 14 but was . regaining contact with her parents, was displaying unusual behaviour. 'She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation' Judge Michael Henshell . She had been singing gospel songs and praising God, grabbed one man in the street and shook his head while saying \u2018he\u2019s the devil, he\u2019s the devil\u2019 and sprayed graffiti on gravestones at a cemetery. After she was sent to the medium-security Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, Manchester. following Mr Hassan\u2019s killing, she continued to act violently. Campbell even misused legal highs while under the care of staff and on another occasion attacked an elderly female resident. William Staunton, defending, conceded that Campbell was a dangerous offender and a serious risk to members of the public. He added: \u2018We can\u2019t ignore the dreadful way this man died. She appears to know she was responsible for the death of this man. \u2018While in police custody she went in to prayer and sought forgiveness. It was a brutal and frenzied attack, but one which was committed during an episode.\u2019 Response: Police were called to the flat in Longsight after neighbours heard Mr Hassan 'screaming for help' Under guidance from Dr Fareed Bashir, Campbell\u2019s psychiatrist at the Edenfield Centre, Judge Michael Henshell ruled a prison sentence would be more appropriate than a hospital order because of her risk of harm. Judge Henshell said: \u2018There were no eye witnesses to the fatal attack, but it is clear from the evidence at the scene that he must have been attacked initially in his own home and during the attack fled to a nearby house, leaving a trail of blood which stretched form his flat to the hallway of his neighbour\u2019s house. 'She said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself' Neil Usher, prosecuting . \u2018A neighbour heard a disturbance at 5am with sounds including him crying for help and the defendant urging the dog to attack him. When the police opened the door the scene that confronted them was truly horrific. \u2018Her appearance was that she looked deranged - her hair was matted with blood and she was breathing heavily and muttering to herself. It was clear he was already dead. \u2018There have been a significant history of behavioural problems since childhood. She began to exhibit psychotic symptoms at around the age of 16 where she could be volatile and violent. \u2018In answer to the question of dangerousness I can say most certainly she is. She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation. \u2018The harm here is exceptionally grave, the culpability is diminished by her mental condition. I have no hesitation that a life sentence is justified. She will be on licence for life and liable to recall at any time.\u2019 Mr Hassan had been living in Britain since 2001 but had recently been refused asylum and was looking at ways of staying in the country."}]}

One of the rarest events in the universe has been seen by scientists for the first time. A stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers. Known as 'relativistic jets', they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length. The swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stunning: This illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star. Such an event took place four billion light years from Earth . Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical (white, purple) and X-ray telescopes (yellow and red) showing the bursts . Most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core, with masses of millions or even billions of suns. Scientists were first alerted to the . phenomenon in March after Nasa's Swift telescope detected several bursts . of X-rays from a quiet patch of sky. Teams from both Pennsylvania State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in . Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9billion light years away. As a star falls toward a black hole, it is ripped apart by intense . tides. The gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around . the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of . degrees. The innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole, . where rapid motion and magnetism create dual, oppositely directed 'funnels' through which some particles may escape. Jets driving matter . at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the . black hole's spin axis. In the case of Swift J1644+57, one of these jets . happened to point straight at Earth. Dr David Burrows, from Pennsylvania State University which controls Swift, said chemical analysis of the bright flash's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns. Writing in Nature, they concluded that the Swift satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light. Dr Burrows said: 'Incredibly, this source is still producing X-rays and may remain bright . enough for the Swift satellite to observe into next year. It behaves . unlike anything we've seen before.' The black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star. The absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black holes.Super-massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses. By comparison, the sun is just one solar mass and the Earth is 1/332,950th of a solar mass. Black holes are probably the strangest cosmic phenomenon that we know about. Their gravity is so strong that normal laws of physics just don't apply, with time actually slowing down at a black hole's event horizon - the point at which it would be impossible to escape its clutches."}]}

Speaking at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference, Chip said he was sporting a pair that had \"yet to see a washing machine\" in over a year. Worried about germs, you germaphobes? No problem, he says. Just stick your jeans in the freezer once a month next to the frozen waffles to kill off the bacteria. Apparently getting them icy will neutralize the sweat, coffee spills and other bodily fluids that might collect in the zipper or \"seating\" area. He also suggests spot cleaning with a sponge or a toothbrush. While that could work for the stuff on the outside of your jeans, what about all the stuff your body cooked up that's on the flip side? Once you get 'em back up to body temperature, won't you be warming up those germs again? Yuck. Jean freezing has become quite the craze in the past few years. It even comes with its own video tutorials and folding techniques posted online by bloggers around the country. Interesting, but somehow I doubt an overnight stay in the freezer is going to silence the filth festival that accumulates on a pair of jeans over the course of wearing them for 30 days straight. The only time I tried jean freezing was during a family fishing trip a few years ago in the Wind River Range. We \"washed\" a load in the river and hung a line up for our laundry to dry overnight. I woke up to unexpected frost and a pair of Carhartts that felt like plywood. If you think it's hard to pull on your jeggings, ladies, try cracking open a pair of jeans that are frozen solid. Bergh claims that not washing your jeans keeps them in mint condition and helps conserve water. Both noble pursuits. But what about conserving the cleanliness of your lower extremities and not subjecting your colleagues to the stench of dirty denim? Have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans? It's a gift that keeps on giving. And with this thought, it has dawned on me. He's not talking to people like my Uncle Warren, who rise with the sun to work the Angus cattle farm that's been in my family for generations. He's talking to people who like to look fancy in their jeans. The people that benefit most from not washing denim are the ones who'll throw down what is for many Americans a monthly salary to buy something they'll never wash, because, quite frankly, they'll probably be worn no more than four times before their next new pair of jeans. And listen, science says this \"freezing jean\" phenomena doesn't stand up to analysis. In plain English: No, freezing your jeans will not kill all bacteria, but throwing them in the microwave just might. Stephen Craig Cary, a University of Delaware expert on frozen microbes suggests \"you either raise the temperature to 121 degrees Celsius for at least 10 minutes or just wash them! The latter surely is the best alternative to save energy.\" He adds: \"One might think that if the temperature drops well below the human body temperature they (bacteria) will not survive, but actually many will. Many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures.\" Then again, since much of a CEO's job is to drum up as much marketing buzz as possible, it's no wonder that Bergh is making this unsanitary claim -- thereby bringing Levi's back to the forefront of a conversation. Even if it makes him smell like a farm animal."}]}

As this incredible series of photographs shows, while her peers were growing up, fighting with their parents and doing everything else a normal teenager does, the 14-year-old Griffith had an extra influence at home - her enormous, live-in pet lion. Pictured in 1971 lounging by the pool, playfighting, and even in bed together, Melanie and Neil, as the hulking African big cat was known, can be seen sharing a touching bond. Neil came to live with the family in bizarre circumstances, after they adopted him from Anton Lavey, High Priest of the Church of Satan, who was told he could no longer keep him in his small San Francisco apartment.

The majestic beast was adopted by the family after they took a trip to Africa and decided to make a movie about lions, Roar, which would take 11 years to complete. Sadly, the movie was a box office flop,and the production was plagued by injuries resulting from working with lions. Griffith herself required 50 stitches at one point after being bit by one of the cats, and cinematographer Jan de Bont had to have his scalp sewn back on after being attacked. In total, despite its $17million price-tag, the film only made $2million at the box office. But the movie stands as a testament to the family's love of lions - which Hedren still keeps at her home on a wildlife reserve in California. Today: Griffith (pictured left in 2014, now aged 57), had the lion in her life thanks in part to Anton Lavey (right), High Priest of the Church of Satan .

But that does mean we miss out on all the Christmas specials, films and end of the year quizzes. With this in mind, a pair of teenagers has created a wearable band that knows when its wearer has dozed off. It then pauses and records whatever was being watched so it can be viewed later on. Scroll down for video . The KipstR band uses a pulse oximeter to establish when the wearer has fallen asleep, or wakes up again. The band then mimics a TiVo remote by pausing, recording or resuming the show that is currently being watched. Other people in the family can then change the channel without interfering with the recording . Called KipstR, the 3D-printed band was created by Manchester students Ryan Oliver, 15, and Jonathan Kingsley, 14, in partnership with Virgin Media as part of its Switched on Futures initiative. The wearable tech features a pulse oximeter, and a wireless sensor which means it can \u2018talk\u2019 to a Virgin Media TiVo box. Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed. When people fall asleep, this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off - and equally, when they are awake again. The current KipstR prototype (pictured) features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery . KipstR measures a user\u2019s heart rate to detect sleep. It then communicates with a Virgin Media TiVo box to pause and record the current programme being viewed. When the user\u2019s heart rate rises to \u2018awake\u2019 levels it triggers Virgin Media\u2019s TiVo boxes to resume the programme. The current KipstR prototype features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery. The spark core chip at the heart of KipstR processes all the data from the pulse-oximeter, dictating when the band triggers TiVo to record, pause or re-play. The outer casing of KipstR is 3D printed using an Objet Connex 3D Printer using a resin called Polyjet. This resin is more robust than the rigid plastics used by most 3D printers. Wearable technologies such as KipstR could also be used to monitor wearer\u2019s emotional reactions to their TV viewing, helping TiVo learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer. Virgin Media will be trialling KipstR this Christmas with customers able to register interest in KipstR from this month. It is also exploring how KipstR could sleep-control other connected devices in the home including powering up and down devices and controlling customers central heating, helping save time and money. Once KipstR establishes the wearer has fallen asleep, the band mimics a TiVo remote to pause and record the show that is currently being watched. And if the person wakes up, the show will resume. Additionally, once a show is being recorded, other people in the family can change the channel without interfering with this recording. Mr Oliver, studying at Manchester Creative Studio said: \u2018We jumped at the chance to work with the Virgin Media team on this project, it was a brilliant challenge for us but we\u2019ve learnt so much and are really pleased with the end result.\u2019 The band features a pulse oximeter, and a wireless sensor which means it can \u2018talk\u2019 to a Virgin Media TiVo box. Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to parts of the body where the sensor (pictured) is placed . The 3D-printed KipstR band was created by Manchester Creative Studio students Jonathan Kingsley (pictured left), 14 and Ryan Oliver (pictured right), 15, in partnership with Virgin Media . Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed. Oxygen in the air is breathed into the lungs before passing into the blood, where it attaches to haemoglobin, and circulates to the tissues. When people fall asleep, this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off. Mr Kingsley added: \u2018It\u2019s given us a taster for what we would like to do when we leave school. We\u2019re excited to see what the next project will bring.\u2019 Wearable technologies such as KipstR could also be used to monitor wearer\u2019s emotional reactions to their TV viewing, helping TiVo learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer. The firm will be trialling KipstR this Christmas with customers able to register interest in KipstR from December 2014.

A 17-year-old girl has provoked a storm of controversy as she posted a video on Facebook showing her older brother slowing saw the head off a live turtle . As the turtles squirms he then pulls out a hacksaw and slowly saws through the animal's neck for about 20 seconds. Although the turtle moves it's legs it stops moving after as the hacksaw goes deeper. According to her Catrina's comments the pair were in rush and could not find an axe. Catrina seems unaffected, and said they have done this for years, and described how they let the animal's blood drain for several hours. Catrina Shears, from West Michigan, posted the 43 second video of the snapping turtle's death to the social media website this week. The clip, filmed on a mobile phone, shows the teenager using pliers to pull the turtle's head out from its shell while her elder brother steps on the turtle . Then she commented that she 'should have taken a video of the blood squirting' from the turtle's neck. The posting on the video drew heavy criticism on Facebook with many saying if the siblings want to hunt and kill animals for meat the method of death should have been quicker. Other people said that 'decapitation is the humane way to kill a snapping turtle.' After several complaints the Department of Natural Resources released a statement reported Fox8.com, saying: 'We are certainly disappointed anyone would post something like that to social media. Although the actions depicted in this video are technically legal under state statute - provided that the capture of the turtle was legal - we would advocate a more rapid means of taking the animal's life. We further hope this turtle was taken for the purpose of human consumption.' Last night Catrina wrote on her Facebook page: \u00a0'Everyone who messages me saying rude things will also be reported for harassment and cyber bullying if they threaten me etc.'"}]}

Saturday's 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt gave the Bavarian side a record-extending 22nd title since the elite division was formed in 1963, and 23rd national championship overall. With six games still to play, it marked the earliest clinching of the title -- and made Bayern the first team of any of the major European leagues to be crowned this season. The club had previously twice triumphed with four games left, in 1973 and 2003. Jupp Heynckes, who is 68 next month, became the oldest coach to win the league in what will be his second and final season in charge in his third spell at the club. Former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola will take over at the end of this campaign, but before then Heynckes is hoping to complete an unprecedented treble of the German Cup and European Champions League -- and make amends for the disappointment of losing last year's final in Munich. \"The fact that we have won the title after 28 games is extraordinary, it's simply fantastic,\" Heynckes told reporters. \"One of the things FC Bayern have demonstrated this season is that we're a top side, but we have done it with harmony in the team. \"We can be confident we will achieve something in the Champions League.\" Bayern already have one foot in the semifinals of Europe's top club competition, taking a 2-0 lead to Italy for Wednesday's second leg against Juventus. Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the only goal in Frankfurt to earn Bayern's 24th win in 28 league games this season, leaving the team 20 points clear of second-placed two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Bayern's David Alaba missed a 26th-minute penalty, hitting a post after midweek scorer Thomas Muller was fouled, but Schweinsteiger scored seven minutes after halftime with a backheel from Philipp Lahm's cross to dent the home side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. It was Bayern's 11th successive league victory since the winter break -- the first time a Bundesliga team has won so many in a row in one season. It also means Bayern will have led the Bundesliga from start to finish for the fifth time -- no other club has done it even once. Dortmund came from behind to win 4-2 at home to third-bottom Augsburg, with striker Julian Schieber scoring twice in a rare start as coach Jurgen Klopp rested key players ahead of Tuesday's Champions League home clash with Spanish club Malaga with the quarterfinal tie poised at 0-0. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropped six points behind Dortmund after being held 1-1 at home by Wolfsburg, while Schalke went three points above Frankfurt with a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Borussia Monchengladbach went seventh with a 1-0 win over Greuther Furth that left the visiting team rock bottom and nine points adrift in the battle to avoid automatic relegation. Hamburg's European hopes were hit by a 1-0 home defeat by Freiburg, which followed last weekend's 9-2 thrashing by Bayern. It moved Freiburg above Frankfurt into fifth place on goal difference."}]}

Her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in June 2010, with Mr Huhne leaving his wife of 26 years. The 44-year-old PR adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' articles which have appeared since then. She claimed she was subject to 'crude and demeaning stereotypes' about her being bisexual. Dismissed: Carina Trimingham gives a statement today outside the High Court after today's hearing . But despite Ms Trimingham's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a 'cataclysmic interference' with her private life, a High Court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was 'a situation of her own making'. The High Court judge also said he had not found Ms Trimingham to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects. Associated Newspapers described the ruling by Mr Justice Tugendhat as 'an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech'. Associated Newspapers had contested Ms Trimingham's case on the basis that there was an important public interest. Ms Trimingham's counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, said the Daily Mail had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom. Ms Trimingham was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge. Relationship: Chris Huhne and Carine Trimingham, pictured last September, had an affair which became public in June 2010 . He said: 'Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited. 'This is mainly by reason of her involvement with Mr Huhne, both professionally, as his press agent, and personally as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family. 'But it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past. 'Further, she was, as the defendant knew, a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself.' 'Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.'The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making. Ms Trimingham, speaking today on the steps of the High Court, was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by Mr Justice Tugendhat . 'One reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest.' It was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that Ms Trimingham's role in the story of Mr Huhne was so significant, he added. 'Professionally, it was her job to ensure that Mr Huhne received the best possible publicity, but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked, and which she continued to conduct, with Mr Huhne that gave rise to the scandal. He added that although Associated referred to Ms Trimingham's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months, it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in Mr Huhne's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when Ms Trimingham, her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story. 'The distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since June 19, 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her, about which she has not made a claim in defamation, and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible. 'To the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter, insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression. 'In this case what Ms Trimingham complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of Ms Trimingham. 'So the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles, separately, or cumulatively, amount to harassment of Ms Trimingham.' He added that Ms Trimingham had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information, including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony, which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew. Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.' Outside court, Ms Trimingham said she intended to appeal. Ms Trimingham, who is insured, was ordered to pay \u00a3250,000 towards Associated\u2019s costs. A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: 'This was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest. A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making' 'We are pleased that the Court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham\u2019s complaints. 'The references to Miss Trimingham\u2019s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative, private or in any way homophobic. 'Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case. This judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism. Media law specialist Mark Stephens said Mr Justice Tugendhat, in his judgment, had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the American notion of a public figure. 'It is redolent of the approach taken to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,' he said. 'Mr Clinton, as president, had a restricted zone of privacy, and Ms Lewinsky's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him. 'It appears that that ratio was very similar in this case.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}]}

In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com today, Defense Department alumni J.D. Gordon claims, 'Al Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo treated better than our vets.' 'Yes, it\u2019s true. I know because I served as a Pentagon spokesman from . 2005-2009 and visited Guantanamo Bay Naval Base over 30 times during . those years,' he writes. Former Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, left, says the suspected terrorists being held at U.S. military facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are provided with better medical care than America's veterans. Gordon is pictured here at the U .S. Naval Base at Gitmo on July 15, 2009 . In this photo, then-Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, right, walks with courtroom sketch artist Janet Hamlin, left, CNN's Carol Cratty, center, and U.S. military personnel on the way to the courthouse for a U.S. Military Commissions hearing at Camp Justice, the site of the U.S. war crimes tribunal compound, at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base, Cuba on July 15, 2009 . Gordon is a retired Navy commander who served as a\u00a0 Defense Department spokesman under both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. After departing the Pentagon, he entered the realm of politics. In 2012 he served as an adviser to pizza magnate Herman Cain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He is now a national security and foreign policy commentator and a Senior Fellow and Communications Adviser to several right-leaning organizations in Washington, D.C. He is also the Executive Director of a national security-based conservative political action committee called Protect America Today that he helped found in 2012. In his op-ed on Fox's website, Gordon calls on the nation's Commander-in-Chief to 'refocus his priorities' on America's veterans and spend 'less time, effort and energy caring for Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees . at Gitmo and much more attention put on caring for America's veterans.' His op-ed points to\u00a0a Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet on Detainee Medical Care as evidence that the approximately 150 terrorists at Gitmo are taken care of by 100 health care providers. 'Doctors and medical personnel are at their beck and call,' Gordon writes. 'Got a . cold, a fever, a toothache, a tumor, chest or back pain, mental health . issues, PTSD? No problem, come right in. Military doctors are waiting to see\u00a0you.' The Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet claims the 'medical care provided to detainees at Guantanamo is consistent with what U.S. service members receive.' 'JMG providers administer care to all detainees regardless of disciplinary status, level of cooperation or legal status,' it says. 'Detainees are treated at dedicated medical facilities with state-of-the-art equipment and an expert medical staff.' The one-pager also notes that health services are available to suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay 'around the clock, seven days a week. Meanwhile, only one doctor is provided for every 35 veterans enrolled in the Veterans Affairs health care program and the VA's 267,930 employees, Gordon writes. 'If any government entity ever needed a complete overhaul, it\u2019s the . VA,' he says. 'If it were in the private sector, it would have been shuttered long . ago.' Gordon argues that both presidents Bush and Obama allowed the VA to spiral out of control, citing VA officials' big salaries, big bonuses and big budgets for decorating, but zeros in on the current office holder for sitting on his hands for the last five and half years. 'Instead of fixing the problem' with veterans' care, the Obama's administration's ' focus was closing Guantanamo . and improving the comfort of detainees. Even though they already lived . under some of the best prison conditions ever seen.' Gordon, who is a veteran himself, says the government ought to be giving its countrymen and women who fought in uniform the same level of medical care than its giving to assumed terrorists. 'Our veterans have served the nation proudly. In many cases they were . gravely wounded during their service and now will require a lifetime of . medical support. Every one of them deserves better.'"}]}

In his historic service to the nation, the Church and the world, he was a steadfast champion for human rights, the cause of peace and care for the poor.\" Over the course of a career that spanned more than seven decades -- 35 of them as president of Notre Dame -- Hesburgh ended up at the highest levels of both church and state. He marched with civil rights leaders. He was instrumental in giving influence to the laity at Catholic universities. He was a Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency. He was an adviser to presidents, serving on commissions concerning civil rights, immigration and military clemency issues. (And, incidentally, angering Richard Nixon over a report about racial discrimination, which prompted Hesburgh's resignation.) In 1962, he made the cover of Time magazine -- back when that was one of mainstream America's most powerful indicators of influence -- for a story about Catholic intellectuals. He was even one reason that the former Eppie Lederer ended up as advice columnist Ann Landers. As she told the story, when she applied for the position, she was given a handful of letters to answer as a test. For help on some topics she called her friends, including Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas and Hesburgh. Needless to say, she got the job. Hesburgh, a close friend, remained one of the column's go-to experts. But Hesburgh's primary focus was always the school he loved and first attended when he was 16. At the time -- the mid-1930s -- the college in South Bend, Indiana, was known for its football team, its seminary and little else. Hesburgh, a native of Syracuse, New York, graduated from a university in Rome, Italy, and was ordained in 1943. He wanted to become a military chaplain but ended up pursuing a doctorate at Washington's Catholic University. He returned to Notre Dame after the war and became head of its Theology Department, rising in its administration. He made his passions clear even before he became president, clashing with football coach Frank Leahy. When he took over the university in 1952, his goal was to create a \"Catholic Princeton.\" \"The Catholic university should be a place where all the great questions are asked, where an exciting conversation is continually in progress, where the mind constantly grows as the values and powers of intelligence and wisdom are cherished and exercised in full freedom,\" he once wrote. People we've lost in 2015 . He used Notre Dame's athletic fame for bigger ends. The number of students doubled during his tenure. A library now named for him opened in 1963. Its famous mural, visible from Notre Dame's football stadium, is referred to as \"Touchdown Jesus.\" And when he started at Notre Dame, its endowment was $9 million. Today it stands at close to $10 billion, the 12th-largest in the country. \"The great challenge ... at Notre Dame was to create the greatest Catholic university of all time. And I think we achieved that,\" he told Maureen McFadden of South Bend TV station WNDU, a CNN affiliate. There was criticism, of course. He traveled so much he became the subject of a campus joke: God is everywhere, Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame. He disliked the Vietnam-era campus protests and threatened to expel students who were too disruptive. He sometimes butted heads with Catholic leaders. But he was, usually, beloved -- not least by the Notre Dame community. He was known for his availability to students and liked to chat with them. Perhaps his greatest influence \"was on the lives of generations of Notre Dame students, whom he taught, counseled and befriended,\" said Jenkins, the Notre Dame president, in his statement. He was amply honored during his long life. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and more than 100 honorary degrees. For all his influence, Hesburgh never saw himself as high and mighty. His calling was service, and that alone was enough. \"I never wanted to be anything but a priest, which is in itself a great and unearned grace,\" he said. \"I hope to live and die a priest, nothing more, but nothing less either.\""}]}

BBC veteran Michael Buerk was criticised last night for describing Tess Daly as \u2018a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing\u2019. While many agreed with his view that BBC coverage of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee river pageant was \u2018cringingly inept\u2019, they said it was wrong to single out presenters rather than bosses. Others took to the internet to describe his remarks in a Mail on Sunday article \u2013 which saw him call the presenters \u2018airheads\u2019 \u2013 as cruel and accused him of being grumpy. 'Ashamed of the BBC 'Michael Buerk called presenter Tess Daly\u00a0 'a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly' In an end-of-year comment piece, the 66-year-old former newsreader argued that the spectacle of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee was \u2018betrayed\u2019 by the BBC\u2019s dumbed-down coverage. \u2018The one enduring British institution [the Monarchy] was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018On the screen, a succession of Daytime airheads preened themselves, or gossiped with even more vacuous D-list \u201ccelebrities\u201d. With barely an exception, they were cringingly inept.\u2019 He then focused on Miss Daly\u2019s talent as a news presenter. He said: \u2018The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country\u2019s bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park. \u2018I was so ashamed of the BBC I would have wept if I hadn\u2019t been so angry. The worst thing was that it was deliberate \u2013 planned that way to be \u201clight\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d.\u2019 Some critics said while they agreed with his analysis, they objected to what they saw as a personal attack on Miss Daly. Just not good enough: Michael Buerk was highly critical of the BBC's coverage of the Diamond Jubilee - which included Tess Daly . One wrote on the BBC\u2019s Points Of View message board: \u2018I did agree ... but was mystified as to why it was mainly aimed at the indians instead of the chiefs.\u2019 Another said while it was \u2018generally agreed\u2019 the BBC \u2018failed miserably\u2019 in the coverage, to turn it into an attack on the presenters rather than those in charge was \u2018wrong\u2019. One responded on Twitter: \u2018There is no need to be cruel about Tess Daly.\u2019 But there was a lot of support for his view that presenters such as Miss Daly and Fearne Cotton had not been right for the event. In an interview with another Sunday paper, BBC presenter Clare Balding admitted the \u2018light entertainment\u2019 feel of the River Pageant had been wrong. \u2018We want to be informed and interested, we want presenters who are well-prepared and know their stuff,\u2019\u00a0 she said. \u2018Yes, the BBC should entertain, but in doing so they\u2019d moved too far from their remit to educate, too, and viewers didn\u2019t like it.\u2019 Miss Daly was unavailable for comment yesterday."}]}

A couple who took their children out of school so they could have their first family holiday in five years risk being jailed after refusing to pay fines introduced under controversial new laws. Stewart and Natasha Sutherland will appear before Telford Magistrates' Court tomorrow after they took their three children to the Greek island of Rhodes during the school term. The couple were given an initial fine of \u00a3360 after the family of five went away for seven days at the end of September, but were unwilling to pay. The penalty then doubled to \u00a3720 because they did not pay the fee within 21 days. The Sutherland family: (left to right) Sian, 13, mother Natasha, Keane, six, father Stewart and daughter Rhiannon, 15 on holiday in Rhodes . Now the week-long break could cost the couple up to \u00a32,000, while they also face the prospect of a three-month prison sentence. The family booked the holiday in October 2012, before the new guidelines were put into force on September 1 least year. Before they went away, the couple were warned they each risked a \u00a360 fine for taking their six-year-old son, Keane, and their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, on the break. Mr Sutherland, 39, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said, the family struggle to fit in a regular holiday and were desperate to get away. \u2018It\u2019s like a revolving door in our house - I come in from work and my wife goes out.' he said. \u2018We haven\u2019t been able to get leave in the school holidays at the same time for five years, and we desperately needed a family break. Paradise: The family of five went to the Greek Island of Rhodes, a destination popular with British tourists . \u2018I work in a sensitive job where . staffing levels have to be maintained - there\u2019s been a recruitment and . overtime ban and it\u2019s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits . in with the rest of the family. \u2018I . know how important education is - but there\u2019s a bigger picture. Family . time is important, too, and the children\u2019s behaviour and schooling has . improved massively since our holiday together.\u2019 The amendments to school attendance regulations ended a policy which let schools grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays. Headteachers now are not obliged to give pupils leave during term time, expect in 'exceptional circumstances.' Now, according to Section 444 of the Education Act, 1996, parents are legally required to send their children to school on a regular basis, and failure to do so can land them a fine or prison sentence. Youngest: Their six-year-old son Keane was taken out of Donnigton Wood Primary School in Telford . Mr Sutherland added \u2018I informed the school after the summer holidays that we were taking the children out for six days. At that point, I wasn\u2019t even aware of the new legislation. \u2018We had a letter back warning that as the time off was not authorised we could be fined, but the holiday was already booked and paid for - what could I do? \u2018I\u2019ve since become aware that other parents just lie and tell the school their kids are ill, but I was upfront from the outset and raise my children to be honest. \u2018I\u2019ve even heard of local schools . advising parents to say their children are sick to avoid getting fined. What kind of lesson does that teach them - that it\u2019s OK to lie and be . deceitful?\u2019 The couple are . arguing that the education authority has no appeal process and they have . no choice but to go to court to have their say. Older children: Their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, both attend Sutherland Business and Enterprise College in Telford . Mr Sutherland said: \u2018This is not about the fine or the cost of the holidays outside of school term, it is about the principle. I could not have holiday any other time. \u2018We spoke to the school attendance officer and things looked hopeful that the fines would be quashed. \u2018But the next day we had an email back saying once a fine had been issued, it couldn\u2019t be withdrawn. \u2018I asked the attendance officer to put herself in our shoes - the kids go back to school and their friends ask where they\u2019ve been over the holidays. \u2018They have to say 'nowhere, my dad was working. The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school. It equates to \u00a360 per child, rising to \u00a3120 if it's not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court. The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil. If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence. If the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so, he is guilty of an offence. If a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month prison sentence. The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools. 'I told the attendance officer they were trying to deprive children of having a holiday and I was told I\u2019d deprived them of six days education and should feel guilty. \u2018We are their parents; it should be up to us. I have no concerns over any of my children or their level of education. They are all in the top sets, and we believe quality family time is just as important as schooling. \u2018We are bringing our children up to value their education, we know how important it is, but we are being punished for three things, because we work full-time, the fines are double because we are married, and finally because we were honest enough to tell the school the truth about the holiday instead of simply saying the kids were ill.\u2019 Kay Burford, attendance support team leader for Telford & Wrekin Council said the new legislation is clear and any time off is disruptive to a child\u2019s education. She said: \u2018Our policy supports new legislation which makes it clear that head teachers may not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances. \u2018Leave in term-time which results in significant absence from school is disruptive to the child\u2019s education and has a detrimental impact on attainment. There is no automatic right to any leave or holiday in term time. The regulations clearly make the point that the headteacher has the final decision as to whether to authorise the leave or not. \u2018The Telford & Wrekin Council LA Policy Statement has been developed within the context of the national and local priority of raising the educational achievement and attainment of pupils. The Government has renewed appeals to parents not to take their children out of school during term time.\u2019 A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging . effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more . likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. 'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle . poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also . increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the . amount of time they have to pay. 'Parents should never simply discount a possible penalty . notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence . and when doing so they are always risking prosecution'"}]}

The children douse themselves with water and fill plastic cups and jugs. \"Even though we're not sure that it is clean and safe,\" Roselda Sumapit said, \"we still drink it, because we need to survive.\" The scene on a street in the city of Tacloban is one of many CNN reporters and others have witnessed as residents deal with the death and destruction that Typhoon Haiyan left behind when the massive storm tore through the Philippines: . 'Worse than hell' in typhoon-ravaged Philippines . 'We don't have anything to eat' As they searched for loved ones lost in the storm, desperate survivors asked for help. \"Our house got demolished,\" one woman told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. \"My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris. We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat.\" A man begged for forgiveness because he couldn't save his daughter from the typhoon's wrath. \"We all got separated from each other when the strong waves hit,\" he told ABS-CBN. \"We got separated. I couldn't even hold on to my child.\" Another man said he was still trying to find six family members. \"My child has been buried in that island,\" he said. 'I'm going to die' Shirley Lim still remembers the sounds she heard as the storm struck. The wind was so strong, she said, it sounded like someone was crying. \"It's like the movie 'Twister,'\" she said. Speaking to CNN Monday from the city of Coron, Lim said one thought ran through her mind during the storm: \"I'm going to die.\" But Lim survived. Many homes in Coron were severely damaged by the typhoon, she said, as the howling winds ripped roofs off houses made of light material like bamboo. Prison inmates threaten breakout . A man stands on a rooftop, threatening to jump. He is one of 672 inmates at a Tacloban prison, where food and water supplies ran out on Monday. Now, the prison's warden says the inmates have given him a warning, threatening a mass breakout in one or two days if they don't get food and water. From the prison's rooftop, the inmate says he is devastated -- but he doesn't mention food or drink. He says he doesn't know what happened to his family during the storm. Desperate victims at airport . Magina Fernandez's voice cracks as she comes face to face with Philippines President Benigno Aquino III at Tacloban's airport. Help, she says, hasn't come quickly enough. \"We need to get the word out,\" she tells him, \"because the Philippine government can't do this alone.\" Fernandez was among the steady stream of typhoon victims arriving at the airport, searching for food, water and a chance to escape. She tells CNN she is desperate to leave the city. \"Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now,\" she says. \"This is really, really like bad, bad, worse than hell, worse than hell.\" Water, wind and fire create catastrophe . Fear spreads . Richard Young wears a green whistle on a plastic strap around his neck. He has been carrying it since Saturday night when small groups started forming to defend his neighborhood. They stayed up all night, he says, prepared to whistle if they saw any looting. But whistles aren't the only thing they have, he says. Many also are carrying weapons. \"As long as they don't harm my kids, my family, that's OK,\" he says. \"But once we are threatened, we will shoot. All of us, we are ready.\" Already, the Filipino businessman says he's been shocked at the looting he's seen in the city -- not just food, he says, but large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. Thieves, he says, have already ransacked his shop and others nearby. \"We are very afraid. ... In Tacloban we are almost 98% Catholics, and I can't believe they did this,\" he says. \"Nobody would think it's going to be lawlessness.\" 'We were just floating' Tacloban City Councilor Cristina Gonzales-Romualdez and her husband, Mayor Alfred Romualdez were at their home facing the Pacific Ocean when the storm surge came, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Tuesday. Suddenly, water burst into the home and rose so quickly, the people inside had to punch holes in the ceiling and climb to the second floor to avoid being swept away, Gonzales-Romualdez told the network. She found herself worried she would be swept out to sea. \"We were just floating, I was holding on to my kids,\" she said. Bodies everywhere . Days after the storm hit, bodies remain everywhere, some crudely covered, others exposed to the burning sun, CNN's Paula Hancocks reports. Two bodies, one large and one small, lay under what appeared to be a bus shelter below a sign with the phrase, \"I (heart) Tacloban.\" Officials tell Hancocks they are focusing on the living, but the bodies pose a health risk to survivors. \"The stench is overpowering,\" she said. Shocked by the devastation . Sebastian Rhodes Stampa knows devastation. The U.N. disaster assessment team chief has been to some of the worst crisis zones in the world. The devastation from Typhoon Haiyan simply took his breath away when he set foot in Tacloban. \"I have to say, I was caught by surprise,\" he said Monday. \"Just getting off the military transport and looking at the airport, it almost wasn't there. It was utterly destroyed.\" Traveling the region, he has seen huge boats thrown from the sea well up onto shore, and buildings knocked flat by the towering storm surge. In all, he said, these are scenes of \"appalling devastation and tragedy.\" Checkpoints on crucial road . Police checkpoints appeared Monday on the 9-mile (15-kilomter) road from the airport to Tacloban. Officers told Hancocks that desperate residents looking for food and water had been jumping onto trucks leaving the airport. But CNN's Andrew Stevens spent three to four hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the airport road and saw no aid trucks. \"We're still going past dead bodies, we're still going past a shattered landscape,\" he reported. The Marine contingent brought trucks to increase the capacity to bring supplies into the city. Hundreds volunteer to pack aid . At the provincial welfare office in Cebu, hundreds of volunteers pack food and supplies into sturdy white bags. An employee who gives his name as Richard tells CNN's Anna Coren that students, workers and even tourists from Germany had arrived to help. \"I'm deeply touched,\" he said. Hospital without supplies . A hand-drawn sign at the front of St. Paul's Hospital in Tacloban gives a sense of the dire situation there. \"No admissions,\" it says. \"No supplies.\" Interactive map of the storm . Without electricity at the large private hospital in this storm-ravaged city, workers used headlamps for light as they performed emergency first aid on victims who streamed in with wounds from flying debris. \"We just can't keep going,\" one doctor says. \"There's just no supplies.\" Children ripped from arms . Searching for family lost in the storm . Splintered wood beams cover the ground where roads once connected a neighborhood near the coastline. Here, the storm surge plowed down homes, leaving behind mounds of rubble as far as the eye can see. Authorities pleaded with residents in the coastal area to evacuate as the storm approached. It's unclear how many did, and how many may be missing. Amid the chaos, one man says he is searching for his father, brothers and uncles under the rubble. \"We all tried to leave, but it was too late,\" he says. \"I got separated when the waters started rising. I don't know what happened to them.\" Devastation for miles . From the air, the damage to Tacloban is striking. Forests of palm trees were mowed down on hills surrounding the city. Inside the city, the damage is catastrophic. The storm surge shoved massive freight ships ashore. Many buildings were flattened. Those that weren't had large chunks ripped away by ferocious waters and winds from the storm. William Hotchkiss, general director of the Philippines' Civil Aviation Authority, says he's never seen anything like it in decades of flying over the country after storms. He says he fears his country faces more disasters like this in the future. \"The biggest challenge,\" he says, \"is to sort of come up with structures that will take into consideration what they call 'the new normal' -- storms that are maybe as destructive as this one.\" How to help . Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . CNN's David Simpson, Tim Schwarz, Brad Olsen, Chandrika Narayan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report."}]}

Fellow churchmembers say they served as a family for Esmin Green, shown in 2007, after she left Jamaica. Green, 49, is shown rolling off a waiting room chair at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 19. She lands face-down on the floor, convulsing. Surveillance video captures her lying on the floor for more than an hour as several hospital workers see her and appear to ignore her. She died there. But to fellow members of her church, she was known as \"Sister Green.\" Together, they served as a family for her in the decade after she left Jamaica for New York. Green left six children in Jamaica -- the youngest now 14. She had been sending money home.  Watch 'Sister Green' in church \u00bb . Her oldest daughter, 31-year-old Tecia Harrison, told CNN that she cannot bear to think of her mother's last moments. \"I haven't seen it, and I don't think I have the heart or mind to watch it because that's my mother there,\" Harrison said. \"That's the woman who gave birth to me 31 years ago. I cannot watch that.\" Green was involuntarily admitted to the hospital's psychiatric emergency department June 18 for \"agitation and psychosis.\" Friend Peter Pilgrim says he saw Green a few days before her death. He says she was struggling with losing her job at a day care center and had been forced to move out of her apartment. \"Esmin Green is a beautiful person,\" he said. \"She has a good heart. She loved people, and she loved children.\" Green's pastor says she had been hospitalized with emotional problems once before and recently appeared to be in distress again. So the pastor called 911, a decision that haunts her. Upon her admission, Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment, said the New York Civil Liberties Union, which released the surveillance video of the incident Tuesday. Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19, the NYCLU said, and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. During that time, according to the organization, workers at the hospital ignored her. At 6:35 a.m., the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot, the group said. Help was summoned three minutes later.  Watch the surveillance video \u00bb . In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. \"Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital's video cameras, the patient's medical records say that at 6 a.m., she got up and went to the bathroom, and at 6:20 a.m. she was 'sitting quietly in waiting room' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor.\" The medical examiner's office says it is still trying to determine what caused Green's death. Her medical records will be the focus of an investigation. Hospital documents say she was \"awake and sitting quietly\" at the very moment she was actually struggling on the floor. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, released a statement Tuesday saying it was \"shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care.\" James Saunders, a spokesman for the corporation, said seven employees have been fired or suspended: the chief of psychiatry, chief of security, a doctor, two nurses and two security guards. A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green's record when it began the preliminary investigation June 20. The corporation pledged to put \"additional and significant\" reforms in place in the wake of the death. A federal investigation is also under way, looking into abuse allegations at Kings County that were detailed in a lawsuit in 2007. In May 2007, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service sued Kings County in federal court, alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital, the suit alleges, lacks \"the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons.\" Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said.

After Guy Adams, a British newspaper reporter for The Independent, posted negative comments about NBC's tape-delayed Olympics coverage (including one executive's work e-mail for viewers to make complaints), Twitter alerted its business partner -- NBC -- and showed the network how to file a complaint capable of shutting down the offending user. Both Twitter and NBC apologized Tuesday, and Twitter restored Adams' account. Yes, the Twitterverse should be appalled, but we should not be surprised. First off, Twitter is a private, for-profit company. Having provided a free service to millions of Internet users for years, the company is attempting to placate and even pay back investors who have been awaiting returns on millions of venture dollars. This means becoming more restrictive, more top-down and more corporate. Last month, in an effort to raise advertising revenue, the company announced it was closing its API (application program interface) to third-party apps -- meaning people and companies can no longer make applications that stream Twitter data. This makes it harder to see Tweets from places other than Twitter's own website. It's an entirely less open service this way, but it also gives Twitter exclusive control over how and where people access its content -- and advertisements. And now, as if to prove that it's more of a corporate player than a tool for corporate critique and other radical activity, Twitter has given its biggest partners a primer in how to ban users that offend them: Simply ask us. Tech: Welcome to the Twitter Olympics . So is the Net suddenly less free and open? No. The Net -- at least as a technology -- is just as free as it was before. This is simply what happens when we rely on a highly centralized and privately owned tool for a capability that might best be accomplished through a more distributed technology. The Net might be a big decentralized network, but Twitter is a single, centralized node on that network. Our tweets don't self-replicate and spread; they go to Twitter, which then essentially broadcasts them to our followers. This is an efficient system, for sure, but it is also highly controllable. The extent to which our messages proliferate depends entirely on the kindness of Twitter, a company that has priorities other than us. The alternative would be to sidestep Twitter altogether, and re-create its functionality through less restrictive, distributed tools. We could use the messaging equivalent of Napster or Tor -- the peer-to-peer networks that let people share music and movies with each other. Instead of downloading files from a central server, people get bits and pieces of files from one another. Likewise, e-mail travels sideways from server to server, in bits and pieces, with no truly central administrator motivated to ban a particular user for what he's writing. We may not like Twitter for what it's doing, but it's not up to a multimillion-dollar corporation to act against its own short-term financial interests in favor of freedom of our speech. Tech: Meet the man who started #NBCFail . It is, however, up to those of us who want a free and open Internet to make the effort to understand how our technologies work and who controls them. Only then will we be capable of exploring alternatives to centralized corporate software, and of building and supporting them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: A sudden tragedy brings out the best in the media: journalists racing to the scene, ferreting out the details, leading the nation through its grief. It also brings out the worst. In the fragmentary accounts that followed Friday's horrifying massacre at a Connecticut school, some news organizations, following in the tracks of social media, managed to identify the wrong man as the shooter. And then television provided a platform for the instantaneous finger-pointing and point-scoring that all too often follows such shootings. I am conflicted when I watch the instant network specials, led by top anchors and featuring theme music and fancy logos, as I did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Tucson, after Aurora. Of course they want to devote time and resources to a major national story. But it also feels at times like a branding exercise, an effort to grab ratings share after a heartbreaking event. I am conflicted as well at watching some journalists interview children who saw the carnage. I understand their value as eyewitnesses, but these are young kids who had just been through a terrible trauma. To me, at least, it feels exploitative. Some organizations, including CNN, require the parents' permission, but it is not clear that all outlets followed such a policy in the scramble that followed the shootings. I was not conflicted at all when I read that a Hartford Courant reporter called the shooter's grandmother in Florida. \"I just don't know, and I can't make a comment right now,\" Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry. I fail to see what that added to our understanding of the tragedy. Watch: Jon Stewart, media critic, takes on Fox . The worst offense, though, was the headlong rush to identify the shooter as Ryan Lanza, 24, and blast his Facebook profile picture around cyberspace. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, Slate, the Huffington Post and others named Ryan Lanza as the suspect, some of them based on guidance from law enforcement sources. In this wired age, his name was bandied about on Twitter and in other social media forums. The news outlets had to correct their reports when it turned out that the shooter was 20-year-old Adam Lanza, his brother, who first killed their mother. But they had suggested that an innocent man was responsible for murdering 27 people, including 20 children. What's more, most reports erroneously said Lanza's mother taught at the Newtown elementary school (a mistake I initially repeated as well). Watch: From Joe Scarborough to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media meltdown . Blogger Jeff Jarvis, who teaches journalism at the City University of New York, expressed regret for retweeting information about Ryan Lanza, although Jarvis did not use his name: \"I did not say this was the 'alleged' or 'reputed' account of the person named as the killer. These are basic, basic journalistic skills drilled until they are reflexes and I would use them in any story for print. I didn't use them online.\" Not everyone was as candid in confessing their mistakes. The rush to judgment is hardly an isolated incident. After an Arizona gunman last year killed six people and wounded Gabby Giffords, some news organizations erroneously reported that the congresswoman was dead. After the Aurora shooting this past summer in a theater showing a Batman movie, ABC's Brian Ross told viewers the suspect was linked to the Colorado tea party before apologizing for reporting on someone with the same name. Watch: Is 'Zero Dark Thirty' tortured history or propaganda? After Friday's violence, there was an instinct by some in the media to pound away at their favorite positions. Mike Huckabee said on Fox News: \"We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we've systematically removed God from our schools.\" I respect the former Arkansas governor, but Friday did not seem like the time for such a statement. At the same time, Rush Limbaugh ripped MSNBC's Alex Wagner and CNN's Piers Morgan for saying the massacre pointed up the need for stricter gun control. \"You've got a horrible event here, and they're already looking to politicize it. ... These people look at stuff like this as an opportunity to advance their agenda or blame conservatives.\" (The three guns, including an assault rifle, used by Adam Lanza were legally registered to his mother.) All this is reminiscent of what happened to NBC's Bob Costas when he used a halftime commentary to question the gun culture in this country after an NFL player was involved in a murder-suicide. Costas was attacked from the right for daring to inject a serious issue into a sporting event. Watch: The media fixate on Hillary and 2016, again . Except in the days following a mass shooting, the media seem to shy away from a serious debate over gun control, perhaps fearing that it is too divisive and will alienate a broad swath of readers and viewers. The mainstream press operates under the assumption that Congress will never pass a gun-control measure because of the NRA's clout and therefore the matter isn't much worth pursuing. The issue was barely mentioned in the presidential campaign, and journalists made no attempt to force it onto the national agenda. The same thing will happen after Newtown inevitably fades from the newscasts and the front pages, and the gun question disappears until the next big tragedy forces us to revisit it once again.

Even the one that isn't human. The Seattle resident scaled the skyscraper's stairway heights on Sunday thanks to what the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago calls the \"world's first neural-controlled bionic leg.\" In other words, when Vawter thinks about going somewhere, it sends a signal to his prosthetic right leg that spurs it to move. This kind of technology has been implemented before in arms and fingers, but never before in a leg. While Vawter, 31, has been part of the Illinois rehab center's trial for about a year, this weekend's fourth annual SkyRise Chicago fundraiser was the first public test of the technology. There was no guarantee he'd successfully climb the entire skyscraper formerly known as the Sears Tower, but he'd certainly give it a shot. Yet there he was -- 53 minutes, 9 seconds after he set off -- in the tower's SkyDeck Chicago, and seemingly on top of the world. 'Bionic blonde' uses triathlon to take control . \"It was a good goal for the team to shoot for, and we hit it,\" he said immediately afterward. This perch was a far cry from where Vawter found himself three years earlier, in a hospital room after his leg was amputated following a motorcycle accident. He'd long been a runner, competing for St. Martin's University in Lacey, Washington, in races like the 800, 3,000 and 5,000 meters as well as in cross-country events. And now, all of a sudden, he was a patient with just one leg. But Vawter took a positive turn when he teamed up with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, which U.S. News and World Report ranks as the nation's top rehab hospital. He became a willing human guinea pig for researchers testing the one-of-a-kind prosthetic. In an interview with CNN affiliate WLS prior to Sunday's climb, Vawter called the new leg \"a dramatic improvement over my normal prosthetic.\" \"It's something exciting and fun, and I hope that we push the boundaries of what the research and the leg is capable of,\" he said. Levi Hargrove, from the Chicago rehab center, told WLS that \"really advanced hardware\" makes the device work. \"We record all of the data on the computer, and then teach this small microcomputer what it looks like\" as the leg moves, Hargrove adds. Vawter was met with cheers as he entered the skyscraper's front door on Sunday morning, then again after he trekked up the final steps. He had plenty of company and fellow inspiration as he went skyward, as one of about 3,000 people making the climb and raising roughly $1 million for the rehab center. Among them was U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, who has worked tirelessly with the Rehabilitation Institute since suffering a stroke last January. In his first public appearance since then, he climbed 37 flights in about an hour. \"However bad it looks, if you or a loved one has suffered a debilitating stroke, you could be climbing the tower one day with us,\" Kirk said afterward, in comments provided by RIC. \"Don't give up!\" That is Vawter's mindset as well. He's happy to help the cause, and to move forward in his own life with his new prosthetic's help. \"It feels awesome,\" he said of the leg."}]}

Boys who are new to the team were pinned down by seniors in the locker room, one of whom would anally penetrate them with his finger then stick it in the boys mouth, it was claimed this week. Arrest warrants have been issued for seven members of the team, who play for Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey. And now claims have emerged that seven people at once were required for the sick ritual. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else\u2019s son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' All seven of the accused players have been charged with sex crimes. Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports\u00a0NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player\u2019s mouth.' One official also told\u00a0ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.\u00a0'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. Upset: Audience members react as members of the Sayreville Board of Education  address a hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team . Discussion: Members of the Sayreville Board of Education hold a press conference at the Selover School in South Amboy, N.J., to address a hazing incident that 'went too far' 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating\u00a0former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle."}]}

Actor Benicio Del Toro stars in \"Che,\" which details Che Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution. The movie was screened Saturday in the Yara movie theater in central Havana as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. \"Che\" also played Sunday at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. \"Che\" stars Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro in the title role, for which he won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. But it's one thing to make a movie about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and the Cuban revolution and show it in France, quite another to screen it in Cuba. Speaking to CNN outside the Karl Marx Theater, the bilingual Puerto Rican actor admitted some anxiety. \"This is Cuban history, so there's an audience in there that probably, that could be the biggest critics and the most knowledgeable critics of the historical accuracy of the film,\" Del Toro said.  Watch Del Toro talk about the movie in Cuba \u00bb . It appears he needn't have worried. Audiences gave the movie hearty ovations. And Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Cuban government, gave Del Toro a glowing review. \"Del Toro personifies Che in a spectacular manner, not only his physical appearance but also his masterly interpretation,\" the state newspaper said. After the showing, Del Toro characterized the public reaction as \"sensational, a shot of adrenaline,\" Granma said. \"The dream was to make this movie and to bring it here, where it all began.\" The movie has two parts: \"El argentino,\" which portrays Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, and \"Guerrilla,\" which shows Guevara's efforts in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also directed Del Toro in the 2000 film \"Traffic,\" for which Del Toro won an Oscar. At 4 hours and 17 minutes, \"Che\" can test viewers' stamina. But that wasn't a problem in Havana. It's a story Cubans know by heart. But this time, it's told by outsiders. Catalina, a history professor who would give only her first name, was a tough critic. \"The movie is well-done. It has good intentions,\" she said. \"But in my opinion, in the first part, the scenes in the jungle seemed a bit like a caricature.\" Though some debated the details of this story they know so well, most -- like a young Guevara lookalike who identified himself only as Daniel -- were pleased. \"It has captured history to perfection,\" he said. \"It has been well thought out and well-created.\" Others, like student Susel Paraza, were torn about seeing their history told by others. \"What hurt me a little,\" she said, \"is that it wasn't us, the Cubans, who thought to make a movie like this but instead a foreign director with foreign actors who have recreated this story very well.\" Other foreign actors have played Guevara, most notably Egyptian-born Omar Sharif in a 1969 U.S. production titled \"Che!\" Soderbergh's \"Che\" has been shown at six film festivals worldwide and will have a limited opening in the United States on December 12. It is scheduled for widespread U.S. distribution starting January 24. Although many may not know Guevara's history, his image is recognized worldwide from a photograph taken by Alberto Korda at a Havana memorial service in March 1960. Titled \"Guerrillero Heroico\" (Heroic Guerrilla), the image of a somber, long-haired and bearded Guevara wearing a beret with a lone star became what the Maryland Institute College of Art called \"the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century.\" The image has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to posters and even tattoos. \"There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?\" Trisha Ziff, the curator of an exhibition on the iconography of Guevara, asked in a 2007 interview with the BBC. \"Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level -- whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalization.\" Guevara was 31 years old when the photo was taken. He has been dead for 41 years, longer than he was alive. Jonathan Green, former longtime director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has been quoted as saying, \"Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn't anything else in history that serves in this way.\" CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report."}]}

The smell of bacon cooking can really get your taste buds going but a bridal store in the Wintergarden shopping centre in Brisbane, Queensland has complained about the fatty aroma coming through the air conditioning vents from the nearby Gramercy Coffee cafe. After cooking bacon since January last year, cafe owner Mitch Suchowacki received a letter from the centre's management last month pointing out that his lease did not allow him to cook items that required an extraction fan. Mitch\u00a0Suchowacki has been banned from using bacon at his cafe and now uses jamon instead . Mr Suchowacki said he had been approached by management earlier in the year about the quantity of bacon being cooked. 'We used to just fry it on the grill which was quite smelly I guess, so then we started baking it in the oven which heavily reduced the smell and we thought everything was good because we hadn't heard anything since that,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But now the bacon has had to be replaced on the menu with jamon - thinly sliced cured ham. Mr\u00a0Suchowacki is disappointed about the way the issue had been handled with Winnie bridal shop. 'We have had zero communication with the bridal store which has frustrated me a little bit,' he said. 'If they had just approached us I would have been very happy to look at the options, or rework our menu, or do whatever is possible because we don't really want to be at odds with another tenant.' Mr Suchowacki (far right) with his staff at Gramercy Coffee cafe  where the smell of cooking bacon has upset a nearby bridal store . However, Mr Suchowacki understands why his fellow tenant was upset about the situation. 'I would not be happy if I felt that a smell detracted from business - so I really get where they are coming from but i just felt that the way it was handled by themselves and management wasn't an appropriate way to do it.' But he added that there also needed to be a 'level playing field'. 'You can always smell different things from the food court and I think that's an attractive part of the centre - to have a bit of a sensory experience, so I'm not sure why we are the only ones who have this issue when there is so much going on in the centre,'he said. The Wintergarden shopping centre's management was uncontactable on Sunday but\u00a0The Courier Mail\u00a0reported that a centre spokesperson said the cafe's lease stated that cooking bacon 'is not and has never been permissible'. Mr\u00a0Suchowacki said most customers had accepted the menu item exchange with only a few upset that they can't have their 'Saturday morning bacon and eggs.' Daily Mail Australia contacted the Winnie bridal shop but did not hear back before publication. It stipulates in Mr\u00a0Suchowacki's lease agreement that he was not to cook food which needed an extraction or exhaust fan ."}]}

Despite facing arguably the strongest team in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying game, England can take statistical respite from the fact they are playing Switzerland on a Monday. It may be the hardest day of the week for many of us to wake up, but England have an impressive win percentage of 67.3 per cent from games played on a Monday. The Three Lions have only played nine Monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. Happy Mondays: England have won 37 of 55 games (67.3%) they have played on a Monday . Let it begin: England players train in Basle ahead of their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland . Staying power: Jack Wilshere is one of only two players who started the last game against the Swiss in 2011 . Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday, which may have influenced statistics that sees them having won 37 of 55 games played while drawing 11 and losing seven. England's game on Monday is a consequence of UEFA spreading out qualification matches as part of their new 'Week of Football' concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday. That means that 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per ent during 2012 qualifying. The final set of fixtures in each group, scheduled for October 2015 - will still kick-off simultaneously. Meanwhile, here are all the other facts and figures on games between Switzerland and England ahead of a meeting that will help determine where we finish in our group... Sick note: England will be without Daniel Sturridge after the striker picked up a knock in training . Spot on: Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring a penalty in the international friendly against Norway . 63.6% - England\u2019s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss. 1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson \u2014 England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland. 2 - Only two players have survived from England\u2019s last game against the Swiss \u2014 Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011. 17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches.

If you thought Mars was the best place in the solar system to find signs of life, you might need to think again. The largest moon in our solar system, a companion to Jupiter named Ganymede, might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich. And the Nasa-funded research suggests that this may have once been a suitable environment for primitive life. Scroll down for animation . Steve Vance and his team showed that ice and water under the surface has different densities. At the top is the lightest 'Ice I' that is similar to ice cubes in your drink, ranging to the heaviest and densest 'Ice VI' that would sink to the bottom of the sea . Previously, . the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just . two layers of ice, one on top and one on bottom, but now it seems it has . multiple layers. The study, led by Steve Vance of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides new theoretical evidence for the team's \u2018club sandwich\u2019 model, first proposed last year. The Nasa-funded research modelling the moon's makeup supports idea that primitive life might have possibly arisen on the icy moon. Scientists say that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life . For example, it's possible life began on Earth in bubbling vents on our sea floor. Prior to the new study, Ganymede's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice, not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life. The 'club sandwich' findings suggest otherwise: the first layer on top of the rocky core might be salty water. 'This is good news for Ganymede,' said Vance. 'Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean. 'When we added salts to our models, we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor.' Ganymede is one of Jupiter's four largest satellites known as the Galilean moons. From left to right in this artist's mosaic they are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are pictured above the Great Red Spot, a storm on Jupiter that has been raging for over 400 years . Nasa scientists first suspected an ocean in Ganymede in the 1970s, based on models of the large moon, which is bigger than Mercury. In the 1990s, Nasa's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's ocean, and showing it extends to depths of hundreds of miles. The spacecraft also found evidence for salty seas, likely containing the salt magnesium sulfate. Previous models of Ganymede's oceans assumed that salt didn't change the properties of liquid very much with pressure. Ganymede is one of five moons in our solar system thought to support vast oceans beneath icy crusts. The other moons are Jupiter's Europa and Callisto and Saturn's Titan and Enceladus. The . European Space Agency (Esa) is developing a space mission, called . Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), pictured above, to visit Europa, . Callisto and Ganymede in the . 2030s. Nasa and JPL are contributing to three instruments on the mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2022. The lightest ice is on top, and the saltiest liquid is heavy enough to sink to the bottom. What's more, the results demonstrate a possible bizarre phenomenon that causes the oceans to 'snow upwards.' As the . oceans churn and cold plumes snake around, ice in the uppermost ocean . layer, called 'Ice III,' could form in the seawater. When . ice forms, salts precipitate out. The heavier salts would fall . downwards, and the lighter ice, or 'snow,' would float upwards. This 'snow' melts again before reaching the top of the ocean, possibly leaving slush in the middle of the moon sandwich. Sotin and Vance are both members of . the Icy Worlds team at JPL, part of the multi-institutional Nasa . Astrobiology Institute based at the Ames Research Center in Moffett . Field, California. The results can be applied to exoplanets too, planets that circle stars beyond our sun. Some super-Earths, rocky planets more massive than Earth, have been proposed as 'water worlds' covered in oceans. Vance . and his team think laboratory experiments and more detailed modeling of . exotic oceans might help find answers as to whether they could have . life. Jupiter's Ganymede, artist's illustration of the interior pictured, is the largest moon in the solar system. Although it was previously thought to have an underground ocean, new research from Nasa suggests it may actually have layers of ice of different density surrounding its subsurface seas that may have hosted life . It may . seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser, but you can see for . yourself how this works by adding plain old table salt to a glass of . water. Rather than increasing in volume, the liquid shrinks and becomes denser. This is because the salt ions attract water molecules. The models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account. The ice that floats in your drinks is called 'Ice I.' It's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water. But at high pressures, like those in crushingly deep oceans like Ganymede's, the ice crystal structures become more compact. 'It's . like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice . molecules become packed together more tightly,' said Vance. The . ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the . bottom of the sea. The densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in . Ganymede is called 'Ice VI.' By . modeling these processes using computers, the team came up with an . ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers, in addition to the . rocky seafloor."}]}

Kimberly Ann Crain, who taught third grade in McLoud Public Schools, faces 23 criminal counts, including manufacturing and possessing juvenile pornography, distribution of juvenile pornography and lewd molestation, according to a Thursday filing in Pottawatomie County district court. The alleged recipient of the photos and videotapes -- sent via e-mail and Skype -- was identified as Gary Joseph Doby. Students allegedly knew him as \"Uncle G,\" according to authorities. The retired Bloomsburg University professor also has been arrested, according to Oklahoma City FBI special agent Clay Simmonds. Doby, 65, faces eights counts of manufacturing juvenile pornography and one count of conspiracy to manufacture it. Doby's location following his arrest could not be confirmed Thursday night, nor could it be determined whether he was being represented by an attorney. CNN's attempts to reach Crain's attorney Thursday night were unsuccessful. According to the complaint, Crain, 48, took photos of the girls in a classroom and at a pizza party at her home. After a search of Crain's home, police confiscated computers and numerous documents and asked for FBI assistance, Simmonds said. Crain was arrested on December 1. The FBI found information on the woman's Skype account that led them to Doby, Simmonds said. A search Thursday of Doby's home yielded a computer \"among other questionable items,\" the FBI said. As he was being led away from his arraignment and extradition hearing, Doby told a reporter for CNN affiliate WNEP in Scranton, Pennsylvania, \"Be kind and considerate to my family, because they're going to need it and they didn't have anything to do with this. They need prayers and it's me, not them.\" Crain is accused of taking photos or videos of girls, in many cases with either their breasts or genitals exposed. A concerned Shawnee, Oklahoma, parent contacted police in mid-November after she became aware of contact the teacher had with students at her home, Simmonds said. Crain had invited the students to her home for a pizza party, according to a Shawnee police probable cause affidavit. A parent said her daughter told her that Crain took photos of the girls, dressed in bras and panties she provided, while decorating a Christmas tree, the affidavit states. The underwear had Christmas themes with words like \"Ho! Ho!\" on them, the affidavit states. According to witnesses cited in the affidavit, Crain also would hold up a sheet in the corner of the classroom and have the girls strip down to their bras and panties. The teacher allegedly took photos of the girls, telling them \"Uncle G\" is going to want to see these pictures.\" The affidavit states the FBI found numerous sexual chats between Crain and Doby on Crain's personal laptop computer. An FBI agent said that in some chats, Doby identified some of the students by name and described how \"he liked the features of their private parts and indicated that he wanted to see them nude. Within the recovered chats, Doby instructed Crain to get the girls to cooperate.\" Another parent said she learned from her daughter that a hidden camera or video camera in Crain's home captured images of the girls changing into T-shirts and panties. McLoud Public Schools said it is cooperating with law enforcement agencies. \"As you now know, the Pottawatomie County District Attorney's office was in the midst of conducting an intense and in-depth investigation; therefore, we complied with its request to not release any information which would in any way jeopardize the investigation, and ultimately, an additional arrest,\" the schools said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Bloomsburg University told CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV that Doby retired in 2008.

Convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot can now truly appreciate the expression \u2018ball and chain.\u2019 The prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend Friday in a ceremony at the maximum-security prison where he is serving 28 years for murdering a woman he met in a Lima casino. Van der Sloot, 26, tied the knot with Leidy Figueroa, 24, in a private ceremony. Prison officials prohibited video and photos during the midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, said his attorney, Maximo Altez. Scroll down for video . Prison romance: Leidy Figueroa, seven-months pregnant bride of  Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, arrives for her wedding ceremony in Piedras Gordas penitentiary July 4 . Groom: Joran van der Sloot, 26, the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend on Friday, July 4, 2014 in a ceremony at the maximum-security prison where he is serving 28 years for murdering a woman he met in a Lima casino . Wearing a tailored suit and dress shoes sent by his mother, Van der Sloot told his bride, who is seven months pregnant, that after he is released from prison, \u2018\u201dI want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,\u201d\u2019 said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding as mayor of the city of Ancon, where the prison is located. The blushing bride showed off her growing baby bump in a conservative white \u2018mullet\u2019 dress paired with a matching shawl. To complete her wedding day look, Figueroa wore a flower in her hair. Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison, according to his attorney. Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Altez showed an oil painting given to him by Van der Sloot depicting a tall, solitary woman in a red dress on a palm-studded beach under a radiant sun. The attorney, who acted as a witness during the ceremony, was one of only four people in attendance, among them another lawyer and the bride\u2019s mother. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot. In 2011, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment. They found love in a hopeless place: Van der Sloot (left) met Leidy Figueroa (right) in prison where she sells candy and cigarettes to inmates; they will welcome their first child in September . The newlyweds met at the prison, where Figueroa, an accountant by training with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. 'They became friends and . spent a lot of time together in his cell,' Altez told CNN earlier this . year. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives . can see inmates inside their jails.' Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy. Peruvian media have floated the possibility that Van der Sloot decided to get married to avoid extradition to the U.S. at the end of his prison term. But his attorney has dismissed the suggestion that the nuptials were a calculated move. \u2018He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child,\u2019 Altez said in May. \u2018There are no hidden agendas.\u2019 Leidy Figueroa told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals. According to the bride, the convict has become a new person and is enjoying his prison arts and crafts classes. Van der Sloot is currently in prison for confessing to killing 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores at a Lima casino in 2010. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2012. Van der Sloot is also suspected of killing 18-year-old Holloway, who vanished during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 and was last seen with him and another man.

The 57-year-old inmate has spent more than 30 years in prison for the 1980 killing of New York City police officer Joseph Keegan. On Saturday, Lorick will appear before a Manhattan parole board for the fifth time and make a case for his release. In the mood for love:\u00a0Bruce Lorick (left), 57, who is serving a life sentence in the 1980 murder of officer Joseph Keegan, 41 (right), has created a profile on an inmate dating site in anticipation of his fifth parole hearing . While awaiting the hearing, the lovelorn Clinton Correctional Facility inmate has joined the dating website meet-an-inmate.com hoping to find women 'for friendship or possibly more,' according to his post, which first caught the attention of the New York Daily News. In his profile, the cold-blooded cop killer describes himself in glowing terms as a 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover.' On paper, Lorick is quite the catch: a brown-eyed, 5-foot-10, 180-lbs college-educated military veteran from a Protestant background whose many interests include books, music, art, movies, horses, 'and mostly anything involving a woman.' And based on his dating profile, Lorick is not the least bit picky when it comes to choosing a mate. \u2018Your race, weight, and looks are not important to me because all women have something special about them, plus I am looking for love instead of trying to find faults in you,\u2019 he writes. \u2018I have no hidden identities, so you can be yourself without fear or shame, as I have learned that people are not perfect, just human beings.\u2019 The post is accompanied by a photo of Lorick sitting on a bench in a green prison jumpsuit with a 'come hither' look in his eyes. While Lorick seems to be very confident that Friday's hearing will go his way, the victim\u2019s family have vowed to do everything in their power to keep the convicted killer behind bars for the rest of his life. On June 13, 1980, transit officer Joseph Keegan, 41, stopped 22-year-old Bruce Lorick at the 59th-Street Columbus Circle subway station for failing to pay the fare. Home away from home: Keegan is serving his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York . When Keegan went to arrest Lorick, a struggle ensued and the suspect grabbed the officer's service weapon and shot him in the head. Keegan was just 44 days from an early retirement. He had been planning to quit the force after 15 years so he could start a family. A year later, Lorick was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He became eligible for parole in 2005, but every time he made a plea for freedom, his request was denied. Last month, 40 of Keegan's family members showed up at the state parole office in Manhattan and handed in their impact statements asking to keep Bruce Lorick incarcerated. \u2018My uncle was executed,\u2019 Noreen Keegan Connelly, the officer\u2019s niece, told the New York Post last month. Lorick's profile on meet-an-inmate is not his first foray into the world of online dating. In 2005, around the time of his first parole hearing, he posted a personnel ad on the site prisonerlife.com looking for a woman between the ages 30-57 'who is unafraid of being herself and desire [sic] to be loved totally.' Finding love in a hopeless place:\u00a0In his profile on meet-an-inmate.com, Lorick describes himself as 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover' A decade ago, Lorick described his ideal life partner as a Christian woman who is not a 'fanatic.' Keegan's relatives, among them more than a dozen cops, were infuriated by his killer\u2019s audacity. His niece was also outraged when Keegan offered her a sum of money last year in exchange for her willingness to drop her opposition to his parole bid. \u2018Of course I declined because there\u2019s no dollar value on my uncle\u2019s life or anyone\u2019s life. He has no remorse and really no regard for human life,\u2019 Connelly told CBS New York."}]}

We may be living in dumbed-down Britain, but it would appear that, on the whole, we\u2019re rather more cultured than some of our neighbours in Europe. We attend more operas than the Italians and visit more art galleries than the French, according to a study. The report says Britons are ahead of our neighbours on nine key cultural measures \u2013 debunking Europe\u2019s view of us as a race addicted to reality TV and celebrity gossip. The report found Britons were more likely to visit art galleries than the French who claim to have the world's best collections . According to the Brussels-based Eurobarometer survey of 27,000 people from across the EU, we are far more likely to read a book, far more aware of history and far more keen to enjoy cultural events such as the ballet and the theatre than the average EU citizen. The land that gave the world Shakespeare has one of the largest theatre-going publics in Europe, with 39 per cent of Britons saying they had attended a play in the last 12 months \u2013 well above the EU average of 28 per cent. Almost two thirds \u2013 65 per cent \u2013 of us have visited a historical monument or site over the last year. That compares with 54 per cent of French and 41 per cent of Italians. France has long prided itself as nation with the best art galleries. But only 37 per cent of French said they had visited a museum or gallery in the past year, compared to 52 per cent of Britons. You are more likely to find more empty auditorium seats in the home of opera, Italy, where only 17 per cent of natives said they had seen been to one in the last year compared to 22 per cent of Britons. We are also more likely to visit our opera houses such as the Royal Opera House in London (pictured) than Italians, while 80 per cent of us read a book last year . In austerity blighted Greece, visits to . historical monuments have collapsed to under half the EU average, with . domestic visitor numbers at such iconic sites as the Parthenon and . Acropolis in free-fall. The survey found 80 per cent of Britons had their noses in a book last year. That compares with the EU average of 68 per cent \u2013 but only just beats the Germans on 79 per cent. With both countries on the verge of political and economic collapse, only half the populations in Greece and Portugal have picked up a book over the last year.

What made this recitation of deadly details different from the ones that preceded it during reputed mob boss Bulger's trial in federal court was that the victim had been the girlfriend of the witness. \"It's affected me and it's going to affect me until the day I die,\" Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi said in the first humanizing testimony the jury had heard in two days of recollections about multiple murders and extortions. Flemmi was Bulger's number-two front man for nearly two decades, when prosecutors say Bulger reigned terror over Boston. Bulger is charged with 19 killings in a 32-count indictment that includes extortion, money laundering, and racketeering in addition to the deaths. \"He strangled her all the way down to the basement...when he got to the basement she was dead,\" Flemmi told the jury, referring to Bulger and Flemmi's girlfriend, Debra Davis. A female juror covered her mouth and began shaking, wiping away tears while she repeatedly checked the time, as if longing for the testimony to end. Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm . Prosecutors brought up the horrific murder of Davis in 1981 just 10 minutes before court ended Friday. In his testimony, Flemmi said his much younger girlfriend became very upset when he left her birthday party abruptly to meet with Bulger. Flemmi said he \"inadvertently blurted out\" to Davis that he and Bulger were FBI informants. \"I bit my tongue and said we have a connection to John Connolly in the FBI and I got to leave,\" Flemmi said, referring to his and Bulger's rogue FBI informant-handler. Connolly is serving a 40 year sentence in Florida on murder charges connected to information he leaked to Bulger. Bulger then said several times that \"he wanted to kill her\" because of what Davis then knew about the duo's relationship with Connolly, Flemmi testified. \"I said no, of course not,\" Flemmi continued. \"And he (Bulger) explained a whole litany of reasons why John Connolly helped us... all of us and (said) 'You are jeopardizing that.'\" Flemmi, who testified earlier that Connolly had tipped them off to indictments, wire taps, and investigations, said it took him a while to come around but he eventually agreed to the slaying of Davis. \"I couldn't do it...(Bulger) knew it ... he said, 'I'll take care of it, I'll do it,'\" Flemmi told the jurors as they listened intently. Flemmi invited Davis to a house he had just bought for his parents, and when they walked in the front door, \"He (Bulger) grabbed her by the throat and strangled her,\" Flemmi said. Prosecting attornery Fred Wyshak asked: \"What did you do?\" Flemmi: \"Nothing.\" Wyshak: \"Why not?\" Flemmi: \"That was the plan.\" At that moment in court, Bulger -- whose attorneys made it very clear in opening statements that he does not want the death of women on his hands -- stared at his former partner for the first time all day. It was only for a few seconds before he turned his head back downward. The two, who sparred with expletives at the end of court Thursday, virtually ignored each other Friday except for that one interlude. \"I wrapped her up and he (Bulger) went back upstairs\" Flemmi went on. Flemmi testified that he \"cleaned up\" and they proceeded to take Davis' body to an area near the Neponset river where they buried her in a shallow grave. The remains of Debra Davis were excavated from a tidal marsh in late 2000. Most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags, a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist testified last week. Almost all of Davis' bones were recovered, according to Dr. Ann Marie Mires. Because her body was in bags, even some of her hair was preserved. The hair, along with pieces of bones, were tested for DNA and were positively identified as the remains of Davis, according to Mires. Bulger trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty . Davis' brother, Steve Davis, has been a regular at trial since it began in June. He told reporters after court, \"I've heard it before. It brings tears to my eyes but I learned how to deal and fight it, because I need to learn more about it, 'cause you don't know all it yet.\" Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders after charges were brought in 2004 and was spared the death penalty after agreeing to testify against Bulger. Of his relationship with Davis, he told the jury: \"I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.\" After court, the attorneys discussed the defense's amended witness list which had been reduced to 30 on Tuesday, from originally over 80 witnesses. Prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly argued that at least 15 of the witnesses -- former FBI agents -- would be a \"waste\" of the jury's time, as they are being called to refute the notion that Bulger was an informant, something Bulger has strongly denied. Kelly called these witnesses \"irrelevant.\" Defense attorney Hank Brennan responded: \"Our witnesses are now down to 30. They are relevant to our case and we intend to call them.\" The defense had mentioned on Tuesday that it would shrink its list if alleged extortion victim Stephen Rakes didn't testify because several defense witnesses were intended to challenge Rakes' expected testimony. Rakes learned Tuesday that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to the stand, according to a friend of Rakes. On Wednesday, Rakes' body was discovered near a walking trail about 30 miles from his home. CNN affiliate WBZ reported that his car was found Friday about six miles from where his remains were found. Federal law enforcement authorities were \"shocked\" to learn about the unexplained death of Rakes, according to a source familiar with the investigation into Rakes' death. Authorities consider Rakes' death suspicious, the source added, and authorities hope that there is no connection to the ongoing Bulger trial. The death is under investigation. CNN's Laura Batchelor and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report."}]}

It was horribly personal towards Arsene Wenger and I have huge sympathy with the Gunners manager for the abuse he had to suffer in those circumstances after the 3-2 defeat. But it did the job Wenger seems incapable of. It got the players playing for him, and it even got the Emirates crowd singing his name after Saturday\u2019s win over Newcastle. Arsene Wenger looks dejected after Arsenal lost to Stoke earlier this month . Of course, Arsenal have a habit of smashing inferior opponents and then failing badly when it matters, so let\u2019s see how the revival against Galatasaray and then Newcastle works out going forward. And what a stroke of good fortune when the Gunners picked out Monaco in the Champions League draw. If they don\u2019t get through that Wenger should resign on the spot and hang his head in shame. But against a backdrop of embarrassing defending, lack of leadership, strange tactics, fans arguing and even fighting among themselves, and a manager being abused by the club\u2019s own supporters, one player has stood out with his quality, his attitude and his demeanour. I\u2019ve seen Arsenal several times this season and on each occasion the Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played well, I\u2019ve never seen his shoulders slump when things were going wrong, I\u2019ve never seen him abandon the sinking ship. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been one of Arsenal's star performers this season . Oxlade-Chamberlain never lets his head drop when playing for Arsenal . What I love about the way he plays is that he is so dynamic: every time he gets the ball I sense that something exciting is going to happen. And he\u2019s not a one-trick Ox either. He can run with the ball, he can spot and execute a pass \u2013 and a killer pass to - he can cross, and he can finish. He played the full 90 minutes in Turkey and then produced a man-of-the-match performance against Newcastle. In the Premier League or the Champions League the Ox has proved he can play in different positions and still produce quality. And he can change a game \u2013 I was in Rio in 2013 when he came on as sub and transformed England from a side being overrun by Brazil, to a team dominating the game. He also scored a wondergoal in the Maracana that day. Oxlade-Chamberlain seems to have the ability to perform at whatever level and on whatever stage you ask him and it was England\u2019s misfortune he was injured for the World Cup \u2013 I believe he could have made a difference. So did Roy Hodgson, that\u2019s why he took the gamble and took the Ox to Brazil in the summer. Sadly it didn\u2019t work out. Oxlade-Chamberlain scored an excellent goal for England in the Maracana against Brazil last year . In my view he should be playing regularly for Arsenal \u2013 he\u2019s been in and out of the line-up this season but has started the last four games \u2013 and should be a permanent fixture for England. He rarely has a bad game, is usually a threat and so far in his career he has conducted himself impeccably. Future captaincy material? I\u2019d say so. One final thought on Arsenal\u2019s win over Newcastle: a decent display from Santi Cazorla, and some have given him credit for staying on his feet in the box instead of going down screaming for a penalty. But what I didn\u2019t like from Cazorla was the dinked penalty at the end. Some call it cheeky, I call it disrespectful and unprofessional. Santi Cazorla chips the ball over Newcastle keeper Jak Alnwick to score his penalty . Cazorla should have shown more respect when taking his penalty . Jak Alnwick is a rookie keeper, Newcastle United\u2019s third choice, on his full debut he\u2019s already had to pick the ball out of the net three times, and knows he\u2019s likely to have to do it again as he sets himself for Cazorla\u2019s penalty. I\u2019ve no problem with the Spaniard scoring the penalty \u2013 of course not. But why is he so keen to humiliate and embarrass a young fellow professional? It lacked class and there was simply no need for it. Cazorla could learn from the Germans who chose to take their foot off the gas against Brazil in the World Cup semi-final \u2013 that could have been double figures easily. The Spaniard is a good player \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to resort to such nonsense."}]}

Save the Children CEO Carolyn Miles recently returned from a visit to the refugee camps in Iraq where she saw the conditions firsthand. (Save The Children) -- Tiny baby Banaz sat sleeping peacefully in her car seat, unaware of the hubbub around her. Her beautiful 2-month-old face was the picture of calm. We sat on an old mattress in the heat and spoke with her parents, who had left Syria just one month before. They fled the violence and instability in the province of Hasakah in northern Syria to come to this teeming, garbage strewn spot near the northern Iraqi mountains. Her young father spoke of the day they decided to leave Syria, when the fighting got to be too much. The family of four -- mother, father, 2-year-old Zahraa and 1-month-old Banaz -- left with nothing but what they could carry on the walk to Domiz camp. Banaz and her family may be some of the lucky ones to get to the relative safety of this northern region of Iraq. The border at the crossing they came through was closed during our visit, with thousands of Syrian refugees, many of them Kurdish, now waiting along the border. They are escaping the fighting that has torn Syria apart and scattered its people. The border points for refugees trying to leave Syria can close unpredictably --just one more piece of uncertainty for a people brutalized by a war that has killed at least 70,000 and driven more than 1.7 million from Syria to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and here in Iraq. These refugees may be the most forgotten of this war, with the majority of the attention and funding for relief going to the large populations now living in Jordan and Lebanon. But Iraq now has more than 161,000 refugees -- most of them in northern Iraq -- and by UNHCR estimates that figure could reach a staggering 350,000 by the end of this year. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which leads three northern provinces of Iraq, has stepped up to try to help those flowing across the Syrian border, providing basic housing and services like meals and water. But the flow is becoming too much, with a camp developed last April for 10,000 now swelling to more than 50,00, with absolutely no capacity to receive any more of those expected to surge in again once the border reopens. The conditions in the camp are tough. More than 50,000 people are packed in a dense area outside the city of Duhok with no sewer systems, insufficient everything, and the threat of screaming wind storms, like the one that tore apart tents the day before our arrival. The smell and the heat -- 90 F when we were there, certain to be 110 or more by August -- follow you everywhere and trash is piled high along parts of the rutted dirt and mud pathways. Banaz's parents were doing the best they could, staying in the tent with a neighbor from their old village while they waited for a tent of their own and searched for work in the nearby village. The father was a roofer by trade and was trying to find a position that would allow him to get his family out of the camp to a better life. When asked if he would go back to Syria, he said of course it was his country and he loved it and would go back -- as soon as it was safe. As we finished our visit, Banaz's eyes fluttered open and she blinked awake. This little baby is clearly cherished in the midst of the squalor and hardship that is now her family's life. She and her parents and sister should not be forgotten in Iraq. It is an urgent and rapidly growing need, and we must all step up and help in a country that now faces yet another major challenge after years of war.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Thirty minutes into the movie \"Miami Connection\" the audience sees a classic '80s montage scene, except there's something a bit off. The film's heroes, a group of five University of Central Florida students who are martial-arts experts (and orphans), hit up the beach for some much needed fun in the sun. (They're in a band called Dragon Sound, which serves as a vehicle for their tae kwon do-inspired songs). As the band members drive along the shore, they catcall out to women with painful lines such as \"they don't make buns like those down at the bakery,\" trying to pick them up using phony French accents. The dialogue hardly matches up with the characters' mouth movements, and the scene ends with two characters making out in the tide, waves crashing down around them. In the context of the film, nothing about this scene really drives the plot, furthers the character development or makes much sense at all. Which is exactly why some fans consider it great. But the term \"great\" is relative. Originally made in 1987, \"Miami Connection\" was rediscovered in June 2009 when Zack Carlson, a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, came across it on eBay and made a blind bid on it. He won it for a mere $50, having no idea he was the first step in the film's unlikely comeback. \"We played a reel in the (Alamo Drafthouse), and the few people that were in the theater went bananas,\" Carlson said. \"We instantly scheduled the movie to play during our weekly exploitation series.\" Though it's not always easy to figure out what exactly is going on in \"Miami Connection,\" the story follows members of Dragon Sound as they find themselves mixed up with a group of ninjas linked to the bubbling cocaine trade out of Miami. It stars Grandmaster Y.K. Kim, a central Florida martial-arts expert, who was pitched the idea of a feature-length film after director Richard Park saw him in the mid-'80s on the South Korean talk show \"Meet at 11 p.m.\" Most of the actors and crew were Kim's tae kwon do students. With the assistance of funding from Kim and some investors, \"Miami Connection\" was filmed in Orlando and Miami. Kim said he had high hopes that his creative work would find a distributor and explode onto the national scene. \"When I finished the movie, I showed this to hundreds of different studios and distribution companies,\" Kim said. \"They all said, 'This is trash. Don't waste your time.' \" Still, Kim pressed on. The film opened in September 1988, limited to eight theaters in the Orlando area. He continued trying to get major distributors for a national release and even tried to rally Hollywood bigwigs at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. But the film bombed, and Kim saw his endeavor slip into obscurity (along with the roughly $1 million it cost to make). When Carlson got a hold of it, enough time had passed so that it was received as something wholly different. He screened it around Austin and noticed a huge, positive response. Moviegoers ate up the bad dialogue, laughed at the bad special effects and staged ninja fights, and reveled in a heavy dose of '80s cheese. Carlson pushed the film to Evan Husney, creative director for the Alamo Drafthouse's distribution arm, Drafthouse Films. In December, Husney called Kim and told him he wanted to rerelease the movie. Thinking it was some sort of cruel joke, Kim hung up several times. Husney courted him for months before the deal to resurrect \"Miami Connection\" was made. Now, decades later, thanks in part to the current love of irony and an enduring fascination with all things '80s, the film is enjoying an impressive victory lap. It screened at the New York Asian Film Festival in July and Los Angeles' Everything Is Festival in August, where the reaction was largely the same as Carlson witnessed when he first discovered it. \"What I'd like to think is that people really get enthusiastic about the sincerity in the movie,\" Carlson said. \"They initially get pulled in by the irony, the '80s fashion, but what's underneath it is very entertaining. People respond to many different things, but they start to like the characters.\" \"Miami Connection\" is seeing the national rollout in theaters that Kim had always hoped would happen. DVDs, Blu-rays and soundtracks are available -- even vinyl singles for those wanting to keep things fittingly retro. Kim is going to a handful of showings and providing a martial-arts demonstration for moviegoers. The experience has taught Carlson that \"bad movies that people respond to aren't actually bad.\" \"There's a sincerity within them that people latch onto,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of technique or talent behind 'Miami Connection.' But there's so much initiative and dedication behind it, even if they failed at what they were trying to do. They were really into it and really trying. That's why people are responding to it now.\" \"Miami Connection\" opens November 9 in Los Angeles and New York, with a nationwide release in other cities scheduled through December."}]}

The story will leave the headlines at the end of this week but on Monday hundreds of thousands of workers will return to factories that are frankly further tragedies waiting to happen, and will keep producing clothes for high street brands. Seven hundred workers have died in factory collapses and fires in this very small region outside Dhaka alone in the last decade. Savar, where the building collapse took place, is a swampland (yes, swampland...) north of the Bangladeshi capital which has seen mass growth in recent years. This same region was the site of a horrific factory fire in November last year, when 112 workers burned alive in a building with no fire exits. Hundreds of factories are being thrown up in a short space of time, with limited building regulations, to meet the growing demand from western brands for cheap export clothing. And it is cheap. Wages for Bangladeshi workers are the lowest in Asia, aside from the recently opened Myanmar industry, at $37 a month. Read more: At least 250 killed in fire at Bangladeshi clothing factory . As the demand for cheap clothing grows in the west, brands continue to look for ways to race to the bottom on prices, and sadly this involves cutting corners on health and safety. Brands will by no means admit to this. The prices that they pay, they assure us, are enough to pay workers enough to live on and keep factories in tip top condition. But, faced with constantly decreasing incomes, factory owners inevitably let things slide, like replacing faulty machinery or fixing worrying building subsidence... When garment factories were still mainly based in retail countries, consumers knew people who held jobs in factories, and had a personal connection with those who had been injured or put at risk in the workplace. But with globalization has come consumer apathy. Who cares about people who make clothing? As long as it is cheap we will buy it. Especially in a recession, cheap clothing is a welcome industry for many. People in western countries living on the poverty line need to buy clothes for their children. Jobs in Bangladesh are also vital for a country where hundreds of thousands of people live below the poverty line. It isn't the responsibility of the consumer to feel guilty about buying what is readily available in shops. Business must stop just holding up its hands to say: \"It is not our fault -- they bought it.\" The responsibility for ensuring that a product was made with human rights in mind has to fall somewhere, and the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights says that it falls jointly to states and mass corporate businesses to \"protect, respect and remedy\" human rights. In short, the brands, not the consumer, are the ones who must take responsibility for the endemic problems that this industry faces. Read more: Is your old -shirt making Africa poor? So what can be done? Many western brands rely on audits and in-house checks to monitor whether conditions in their factories are up to scratch. In a country where a little hand shake and a small exchange of money gets the job done, this process often fails to give an accurate picture of factory conditions, building and fire safety. It is common for fire extinguishers to be borrowed for inspection day, for workers to be schooled in what answers they have to give when asked questions. The Clean Clothes Campaign together with local and global unions and labor rights organizations, has developed a program that hopes to solve this. The Bangladesh Building and Fire Safety Agreement is a proposal for a sector-wide initiative that includes independent building inspections, worker rights training, public disclosure and a long-overdue review of safety standards. The crucial element of this is that unions and worker led committees take a central role in monitoring and reporting back on improvements that need to be made, in a public way. This transparent and practical agreement is unique in that it is supported by all key labor stakeholders in Bangladesh and internationally. So far, U.S. company PVH, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and German retailer Tchibo have signed up to the program, but it needs a critical mass of brand support to be implemented. Joint memorandam of understanding on fire and building safety: . Labour Behind the Label and others are calling on all brands sourcing from Bangladesh to publicly sign up to take part in the building and fire safety scheme to make transparent, worker-led improvements to the industry. Read more: Retailers and suppliers hit by fallout from deadly Bangladesh factory fire . In the wake of tragedies such as yesterday's building collapse, the Tazreen fire in November, and the nearby Spectrum factory collapse some years ago, something must be done to make a change. This proposal is the best on the table by far. How many more deaths will it take to move brands from making CSR statements of regret, to investing in a sustainable and safe industry? We hope none."}]}

If your name is Cliff Richard however, they'll send a TV helicopter. #rotherham'. Another said: 'The reference to perpetrators being virtually all Pakistani has been removed from the BBC piece #Rotherham'. And one wrote: 'Main BBC News website story on #Rotherham does not mention Asian/Pakistani once, they are \"criminal gangs\"'. The report stated: 'The issue of race, regardless of ethic group, should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community.' Report: Professor Alexis Jay warned officers had failed to speak out for fear of being seen as racist . Council staff were given \u2018clear directions\u2019 from managers to downplay the \u2018ethnic dimension\u2019 of the abuse despite almost all the perpetrators being of Pakistani heritage. Three separate reports warning of the scale of the abuse were \u2018suppressed or ignored\u2019 by the council because it was \u2018in denial\u2019 about the crimes. Despite the appalling failures in the case, no one in authority has been sacked or even disciplined. MPs and charities said the scale of the abuse was almost \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 and called for a criminal investigation into those who helped cover it up. And at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation. A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion we\u2019ve sanitised our reporting is nonsense. 'Our coverage on BBC News, including online, has made it clear that the abusers were predominately Asian and that council staff feared being labelled racist. 'Stories on the website are constantly evolving but all have clear links to articles which explain the full context. 'We spoke to members of the Pakistani community in Rotherham on Today, BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC News Channel and more reaction is expected online later. 'As the story has evolved we have covered other key developments such as the resignation of the council leader and calls for the resignation of South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner and we\u2019ll continue to explore all the different angles.'"}]}

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 - but his team gave three possible dates he could step down . Nick Clegg sparked frenzied speculation about the Lib Dem leadership last night after failing to give a clear answer on when he might stand down. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 \u2013 but only after his team had put forward three different possibilities as to when he will quit. The farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that Danny Alexander and Vince Cable are manoeuvring to replace him. Mr Clegg\u2019s aides first indicated that he would fight the next election and remain leader \u2018beyond\u2019 2015 \u2013 giving no further guarantees. But sources close to Mr Clegg then suggested he would quit as leader if the Lib Dems were not part of a coalition government in 2015. When asked whether Mr Clegg would stay on as leader until 2020, a spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: \u2018If the Liberal Democrats are back in government again then Nick Clegg intends to serve a full term.\u2019 Mr Clegg\u2019s office then tried to backtrack, with his spokesman saying: \u2018Our entire focus is on delivering Liberal Democrat priorities in government and then getting the Liberal Democrats back into government in 2015.\u2019 But the spokesman also noted that Mr Clegg was \u2018only 47\u2019 \u2013 a clear nod to him being able to embark on a second career, perhaps as an EU commissioner. His intention to quit the leadership if it did not come with the trappings of power that come with the Deputy Prime Ministership threatened to overshadow his keynote speech to the party\u2019s spring conference. Three hours later, after frantic talks behind the scenes, Mr Clegg\u2019s office adopted yet another position. They tried to quell the leadership speculation, insisting: \u2018Nick Clegg intends to be the leader of the Liberal Democrats today, tomorrow and into the 2015 election and through the whole of the next parliament. The farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that Danny Alexander (left) and Vince Cable are manoeuvring to replace Clegg . 'He intends to be leader of the Liberal Democrats whether or not we are in government.\u2019 But the backtracking came after Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, emerged as one of the front-runners to replace him. He will have to fight off competition from Left-wing party president Tim Farron, who is popular with activists, and Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is the most recognisable Lib Dem apart from Mr Clegg. Leading Liberal Democrats believe Mr Alexander\u2019s high profile in recent weeks is part of a concerted effort by Team Clegg to position his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as a possible replacement. Mr Alexander \u2013 who has recently had a makeover, ditching his glasses and hiring a media adviser \u2013 has been reappointed to lead negotiations in the event of another hung parliament. Asked on Sky\u2019s Murnaghan programme if he wanted the top job, Mr Alexander refused to rule himself out, saying: \u2018There\u2019s no vacancy, I hope there isn\u2019t a vacancy for many years to come. Nick Clegg is doing a fantastic job, I\u2019ve got a big job to do.\u2019 Mr Cable is understood to view Mr Alexander\u2019s ambitions with incredulity and still fancies his chances of the top job. \u2018Vince has been dormant, but he can erupt again,\u2019 one Lib Dem observer noted."}]}

Affluenza snared national headlines late last year when Texas teen Ethan Couch received 10 years of probation after slamming into a parked car south of Fort Worth. The struck car then slid into another vehicle moving in the opposite direction. Four people were killed, and two people riding in the bed of Couch's pickup truck were tossed and severely injured. Prosecutors wanted Couch sentenced to a maximum of 20 years behind bars, while the 16-year-old's defense team argued that Couch's well-to-do parents should share the blame for the crash because they never set limits and gave him everything he wanted. A psychologist testified that Couch was the product of affluenza and told the court that the teen's life could be turned around if he were separated from his parents and placed in a treatment program. A judge agreed, saying that if Couch violated the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years of incarceration, according to a statement from the Tarrant County, Texas, Criminal District Attorney's Office. \"Perhaps the notion of personal responsibility seems antiquated to some,\" Gatto said in a news release this week. \"But I think the majority of us believe that people should own up to their actions, and that criminals should not be able to use their wealth or privilege to lessen the severity of their sentences. Spoiled children shouldn't be able to spoil the chances of victims to obtain justice when a criminal act has occurred.\" Gatto's legislation, AB 1508, \"would forbid a judge or jury from reducing the sentence of a defendant who claims that being raised in a wealthy or excessively lenient household somehow explains or absolves that defendant's guilt,\" according to the news release. The bill specifically states, \"Circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed by law shall not include the fact that the defendant may not have understood the consequences of his or her actions because he or she was raised in an affluent or overly permissive household.\" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report."}]}

Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: the Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939.\" Barry Eichengreen says strong action should be taken to stop the financial crisis from getting worse. BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters. Could this be the start of another Great Depression? Could \"it\" possibly happen again? My stock answer has always been no. The Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers. It couldn't happen again precisely because policymakers know this history. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's treasury secretary. We can be confident, I always answered, that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine. At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters' calls. The first thing that made the Great Depression great, of course, was the Fed's failure to act. It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it. This time, in contrast, the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction. Not only has it cut rates, but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another. Unfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system. One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom. There was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn't agree on what was needed. The result was further instability. That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression? U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves. What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises. When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States. This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system. G7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week. The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum. My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can't afford to wait for years this time around. A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge. The outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed. The economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2\u00bd months. The implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer."}]}

It should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser\u2019s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low, and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small. You can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his Ferrari glides by Casino Square. It is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the Stade Louis II, but maybe one day it will appeal. \u2018It\u2019s true we met Ronaldo,\u2019 nodded Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco\u2019s vice- president and right-hand man to billionaire owner and president, Dmitry Rybolovlev. \u2018I know Ronaldo, but it was not quite on. Monaco's days of signing A-list talent like Radamel Falcao (left) and James Rodriguez (centre) are over . Monaco have downgraded their transfer policy from signing Falcao to the likes of Dimitar Berbatov (right) Rodriguez left the principality to sign for Real Madrid for around \u00a360m in the summer . Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev concedes a France FA bill and FFP regulations have cut spending . \u2018We were joking one day he might come. He likes Monaco, the project, and our president, they know each other. We sat down with Ronaldo but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future. We did not enter into serious discussions with Wayne Rooney, but we had contact about signing him. We were almost at the point of meeting Rio Ferdinand but he did not want to come.\u2019 These targets were set in the heady days after the Rybolovlev takeover saved AS Monaco from relegation to the French third tier and the threat of extinction in December 2011, and then restored them to Ligue 1 within 18 months. Since then, strategy has changed. A-list players are no longer such prime targets. Stars like Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez have left, but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top. The Ligue 1 club held talks with Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo during the height of their financial power . Wayne Rooney (left) and Rio Ferdinand were also courted by the formerly big spending French side . \u2018Monaco is an attractive place,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Families and wives of players fall in love with it. For some, it\u2019s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans. For others, it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer. With equal terms, some players will say no, no, not Monaco, and others will say yes, yes, every time. This was the case with Falcao.\u2019 When Falcao moved on loan to Manchester United, soon after James had been sold to Real Madrid, fans protested and rumours were rife Rybolovlev was bored, feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with Prince Albert, after failing to acquire Monegasque citizenship. These were refuted by the owners, who put the policy shift down to UEFA\u2019s Financial Fair Play rules and a \u00a341.5million bill from the French FA to offset the club\u2019s tax-free status. \u2018To jump-start the project, massive investments were needed,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did. But since the summer 2013, I said: \u201cLook, there won\u2019t be massive investments.\u201d\u2019 Little known Silva Bernardo celebrates after scoring the winner in Monaco's 1-0 defeat of Nice at the weekend . Monaco's rise from the French third division to the Champions League has been bankrolled by billionaire owner\u00a0Dmitri Rybolovlev, pictured here with\u00a0Prince Albert II (right) The principality's lavish lifestyle, low taxes and high security are a lure for professional footballers . FFP rules squeezed this club, with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000. \u2018Nobody wants an unfair competition,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018The trick is how to implement this in real life. Is the recent (\u00a35billion) TV rights deal in England unfair to other European clubs? Can they compete at the same level when Premier League clubs can buy almost any player? \u2018Under these rules, a project like Chelsea or Manchester City is no longer possible. Is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small?\u2019 One arm of Monaco\u2019s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when Arsene Wenger was in charge, producing talent like David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Leonardo Jardim\u2019s squad is the youngest left in the Champions League, even with Ricardo Carvalho (36) and Dimitar Berbatov (34) boosting the average age to 23.9 years. Thierry Henry is one of several France legends to have been groomed at Monaco . Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has  the youngest squad left in the Champions League . \u2018When we signed Ricky (Carvalho) there was so much criticism because of his age,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018But when I met him for the first time, at night in Madrid, in his jeep so no one would see us, I recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot.\u2019 Another arm of the plan is to lean on Monaco\u2019s global appeal and association with its Royal Family and Grand Prix. The club crest has been redesigned to include the word Monaco rather than the initials ASM and this season\u2019s team photo was taken at the opulent Opera de Monte Carlo. \u2018Monaco is a historic club \u2014 one of the major clubs in France \u2014 and the ambition was always to give back this identity,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018We are unique. We consider ourselves part of the principality, which stands in this world for many things: luxury, sports, ecology.\u2019 Arsene Wenger will return to his former club when Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last 16 . The Gunners prepared for Wednesday's clash with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend . They are into the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade and the draw against Wenger\u2019s Arsenal laces the revival story with emotion. \u2018Wenger is revered as one of the great coaches in Monaco history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football,\u2019 said Vasilyev, but he quashed the idea the 65-year-old may return to the club he led to the French title in 1988. \u2018We have to accept Arsenal is a different level in European football. He has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job. We have the greatest respect but to come back to Monaco is not on the agenda. We are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project.\u2019 MAY 2011 . Monaco are relegated to Ligue 2 for the first time since 1976 after finishing 18th. DECEMBER 2011 . Dmitry Rybolovlev acquires a controlling stake with the club bottom of Ligue 2. MAY 2012 . After finishing eighth, the club appoint former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri as manager. MAY 2013 . Monaco are crowned champions in convincing style, securing promotion back to Ligue 1. JULY 2013 . The club embark on a \u00a3140m spending spree, signing Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho. MAY 2014 \u2014 present . They finish second, but Ranieri is sacked and replaced by Leonardo Jardim. A \u00a341.5m tax bill and Rybolovlev\u2019s \u00a32.6bn divorce pay-out play their part as Falcao and James are sold, ending their brief time as big spenders."}]}

The spooky incident happened on October 7, when Flight Engineers Reid Wiseman of Nasa and Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency conducted a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to fix an electrical problem. In video shot by Nasa and uploaded to YouTube last week, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle. Scroll Down for Video . What is it? The astronaut is seen making the repairs in the center of the frame - while circled in red is the UFO . As always, the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course, the footage appeared grainy. The UFO appears during the video at around the 1.50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts. Work: The astronauts carry out their work on the ISS just moments before the UFO became visible . Intricate: The three astronauts are seen here at the beginning of the video around one minute before the UFO appears . According to the Examiner one possible explanation for the UFO is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the ISS. The Space X Dragon ship arrived at the ISS on September 23 and that space ship was followed up two days later by a Soyuz TMA 14M craft that brought three new crew members. However, both the craft are currently docked with the ISS and the UFO in the video appears not to be attached to the ISS. A more likely explanation than a craft piloted by beings from another planet observing human astronauts is lensflare. Light could easily have bounced off the ISS and refracted onto the camera. But, observers have pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a strong source of light near to the astronauts when the UFO is seen. This may rule out lensflare and keeps the object confirmed as a genuine UFO."}]}

The Food and Drug Administration says an outbreak of stomach illnesses in Iowa and Nebraska is linked to salad mix served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants in those states and supplied by a Mexican farm. The outbreak of cyclospora infections has sickened more than 400 people in 16 states in all. The agency says it is working to determine whether the salad mix is the source of illnesses in the other 14 states.

Intestinal illness cyclosporiasis can result in diarrhea that can last for two months . Tracking the bug: Cases of people sickened by a parasitic infection have been reported in 16 states in total . The FDA said it traced illnesses from the restaurants in Nebraska and Iowa to Taylor Farms de Mexico, the Mexican branch of Salinas, California-based Taylor Farms. The company, which provides produce to the food service industry, said its facility located about 180 miles north of Mexico City in San Miguel de Allende is the only one of its 12 sites to be connected to the cases. The salad mix in question includes iceberg and romaine lettuce, as well as red cabbage and carrots, according to officials. In a statement on the company's website, Taylor Farms says the Mexican facility is 'state of the art and has an exceptional food safety record.' The statement said the company is working with FDA investigators who are looking at the facility and that the product is out of the food supply. The agency said its investigation has not implicated packaged salad sold in grocery stores. The salad mix may be out of the commercial food chain as the most recent known illness in those two states was in Nebraska a month ago. The typical shelf life for a salad mix is up to 14 days. There have been more recent illnesses in other states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent illness was July 23.

However, a massive water diversion project begun by the Soviet Union in the 1960s has caused it to shrink dramatically - and this year, to dry up completely for the first time. This series of images from Nasa\u2019s Terra satellite reveals the shocking change. Scroll down for video . Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region\u2019s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops.

Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. The lake they made, the Aral Sea, was once the fourth largest in the world. Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. This series of images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite documents the changes. At the start of the series in 2000, the lake was already a fraction of its 1960 extent (black line). The Northern Aral Sea (sometimes called the Small Aral Sea) had separated from the Southern (Large) Aral Sea. The Southern Aral Sea had split into eastern and western lobes that remained tenuously connected at both ends. These images show the incredible changes in the region. Taken on August 15th 2001 (left) and August 19th 2014, they show the entire central area has dried up. By 2001, the southern connection had been severed, and the shallower eastern part retreated rapidly over the next several years. Especially large retreats in the eastern lobe of the Southern Sea appear to have occurred between 2005 and 2009, when drought limited and then cut off the flow of the Amu Darya. Water levels then fluctuated annually between 2009 and 2014 in alternately dry and wet years. Dry conditions in 2014 caused the Southern Sea\u2019s eastern lobe to completely dry up for the first time in modern times. As the lake dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. According to NASA, the loss of the water's moderating influence has also led to more extreme temperatures in the region, making winters colder and summers hotter and drier. Aralsk's Mayor Alashbai Baimyrzayev points at a fishing boat on dry dock 23 March 1999 near the city of Kyzmet in the Aral Sea. The Aral Sea is actually not a sea at all. It is an immense lake, a body of fresh water, although that particular description of its contents might now be more a figure of speech than practical fact. Beginning in the 1960s, farmers and state offices in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Central Asian states opened significant diversions from the rivers that supply water to the lake, thus siphoning off millions of gallons to irrigate cotton fields and rice paddies. As recently as 1965, the Aral Sea received about 50 cubic kilometers of fresh water per year\u2014a number that fell to zero by the early 1980s. Consequently, concentrations of salts and minerals began to rise in the shrinking body of water. The Aral Sea supported a thriving commercial fishing industry employing roughly 60,000 people in the early 1960s. By 1977, the fish harvest was reduced by 75 percent, and by the early 1980s the commercial fishing industry had been eliminated. The shrinking Aral Sea has also had a noticeable affect on the region's climate. The growing season there is now shorter, causing many farmers to switch from cotton to rice, which demands even more diverted water. A secondary effect of the reduction in the Aral Sea\u2019s overall size is the rapid exposure of the lake bed. Strong winds that blow across this part of Asia routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons of now exposed soil every year. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. In a last-ditch effort to save some of the lake, Kazakhstan built a dam between the northern and southern parts of the Aral Sea. Completed in 2005, the dam was basically a death sentence for the southern Aral Sea, which was judged to be beyond saving. All of the water flowing into the desert basin from the Syr Darya now stays in the Northern Aral Sea. Between 2005 and 2006, the water levels in that part of the lake rebounded significantly and very small increases are visible throughout the rest of the time period. The differences in water color are due to changes in sediment."}]}

It's what you might term an upset, though you suspect Alan Irvine can\u2019t have been too devastated. Not when he made 10 changes to the side he fielded in his most recent Barclays Premier League fixture. A cheer for the plucky underdog, then? Not quite. Bournemouth made the same number of changes. What a strange state of affairs, when a last-16 cup tie can\u2019t draw full enthusiasm from either club. More so when each manager would have been entitled to believe they had a good shot at a quarter-final place. That fate ultimately belongs to Bournemouth, who have reached the last eight of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history. Bournemouth's Eunan O'Kane celebrates scoring the opening goal against West Bromwich-Albion in the Capital One Cup . Irishman O'Kane side foots his shot into the back of the net to give his Championship side the lead against their top flight opponents . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Camp 6.5; Smith 6, Elphick 6.5, Cargill 6, Harte 6; Stanislas 6.5, O\u2019Kane 7.5, Gosling 6, Fraser 6.5 (Francis 77min, 6); Kermorgant 6 (Macdonald 88), Rantie 7 (Wilson 70, 7). Subs not used: Flahavan, Daniels, Pitman, Richie. Booked: Harte, O\u2019Kane. WEST BROM (4-3-1-2): Myhill 6.5; Gamboa 6.5, Dawson 5.5, McAuley 6, Davidson 6; Mulumbu 6.5, Baird 5.5, O\u2019Neil 5.5 .

Referee: Paul Tierney 6.5. The manner of the finale was suitably dramatic. Eunan O\u2019Kane had seemingly done enough to put Bournemouth through with a strike early in the second half, only for Georgios Samaras to level with a shot that deflected heavily off Tommy Elphick. That appeared to be that for a side that has achieved so much in recent years, but then it got a little sweeter when, within seconds of the restart, substitute Callum Wilson scored the winner. What drama. It might even make this competition attractive to Bournemouth. Of course, it will need to be balanced against those priorities in the Championship, in which they are currently sitting an impressive fourth after a scarcely believable 8-0 win away at Birmingham at the weekend. Eddie Howe only retained Tommy Elphick from that team; Irvine kept Craig Dawson from the 11 who started in the draw against Crystal Palace. As it transpired, the opportunity of game time brought decent performances from players of both sides. Within two minutes, Yann Kermorgant lashed a shot from distance that Boaz Myhill saved and moments later Craig Dawson was forced to haul down Tokelo Rantie to prevent a breakaway. The fact Youssouf Mulumbu committed a similar offence later in the half said plenty about Rantie\u2019s pace on the counter, which was evidently Bournemouth\u2019s main ploy. At the other end, West Brom threatened without looking dangerous. Scoring hasn\u2019 t been a problem for them in the Premier League \u2013 a tally of 12 that stands up to scrutiny against their rivals in the bottom half - but for a time here they looked ponderous. West Brom's Sebastian Blanco (right) beats  Dan Gosling during their fourth round clash at Goldsands Stadium on Tuesday . Substitute Giorgios Samaras doesn't celebrate after his cross leads to an own goal equaliser for West Brom . Tommy Elphick was unlucky to have crept Samaras's cross past Cherries keeper Lee Camp . Nothing too blatant\u00a0at set-pieces. C . raig\u00a0Dawson and Gareth\u00a0McAuley were both happy to get close at\u00a0corners for West Brom, but nothing\u00a0especially untoward. When Christian Gamboa crossed from the right, Liam O\u2019Neil slipped his marker but barely connected with his header. Victor Anichebe also played in Brown Ideye, but the \u00a310million striker shot straight at Lee Camp. They started the second half with a shade more incision, Sebastian Blanco sidestepping a challenge and dipping a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area. But by the 49th minute they were behind. Considering they came into the fixture with a single away win this season and only one draw, perhaps it should not have been a surprise. Junior Stanislas made the goal, surging at a backline that kept on retreating. He reached the edge of the area unchallenged and slipped a pass left to O\u2019Kane, who shot across Myhill and inside the far post. Ryan Fraser then came close to making it 2-0. The winger\u2019s pace caused West Brom problems most of the night but his finishing let him down when Adam Smith found space on the right and drilled a low cross towards the penalty spot. Fraser controlled with his back to goal, but in shooting on the turn miscued horribly. Samaras levelled after 85 minutes with a heavily deflected shot from the left, but substitute Wilson hit the winner seconds later. Howe threw his hands in the air. He has overseen a special time at Bournemouth. He took the club into the Championship in his first season at the club and consolidated their status by finishing 10th in the last campaign. At the weekend, they obliterated Birmingham and sit in the play-off places. Now they are in a hat with only seven other numbers. Not bad for a second string from the second tier. The Cherries hit back straight away though through Callum Wilson for his 11th goal of the season . Wilson's strike, the second for the Cherries, puts his side through to the League Cup quarter-finals for the first time .

The firm \u00a0is adapting this $199 computer game controller to work with sex toys as part of the project to link couples remotely. The Florida -based cyberdildonics company FriXion is currently beta-testing the system. 'Frixion is a software company, we want to take off the shelf products and work with them, the\u00a0firm's\u00a0founder\u00a0Seth, who\u00a0would\u00a0not reveal his last name, told dailymail.com . 'We are working with robotic devices that we are adapting for this.' The firm is initially adapting a $199 game controller with a built in vibration function. 'We met the guys who invented this, and it fitted perfectly. 'Eventually we will sell out own devices - we have some great ideas.' 'We are an ambitious startup with the goal of getting people interacting physically on the internet,' it says. 'With this in mind, our beta explores ways that intimacy can be augmented by technology. 'Using sophisticated haptic teledildonics two or more FriXion users are able to touch each other and even have sex at any distance.' The network uses off-the-shelf sex toys and already existing technologies and connects them using its network. It allows teledildonic devices \u2014 dildos, vibrators, and sleeves, for example\u2014 to interact with each other using real-time bidirectional force feedback. Called FriXion, the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex aids from different manufacturers easily. 'On the next generation haptic social network innovative and affordable haptic peripherals empower FriXion users to come together and touch each other in tangible, stimulating ways; from holding hands and kissing up to and including full penetrative sex whether your partner is across the room or across an ocean,' the firm says. Founder Seth, says the effect is extremely realistic. 'Frixion is a software platform we're developing to enable people to connect physically over distance,' he told Nerve. 'It feels like the act of sex. While you're thrusting, I'm being penetrated. You're pushing back. I'm feeling the resistance.' Elsewhere, people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of Freebles.

When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive'. Frebble uses haptic technology, or 'tactile feedback' to mimic the sensation of hand-holding through two devices. Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held. They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated 'squeeze bar' to replicate holding hands. A multicolour LED will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting. 'For a granddaughter calling grandma with special news, for a husband far away from a wife, for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother's touch, for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok, Frebble connects \u2013 as simply, subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you,' the company says. 'While there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet, the tactile element has been missing \u2013 until now. With Frebble, you can cut through the distance and share that smallest gesture \u2013 the squeeze of the hand \u2013 that means so much.'"}]}

And federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. But the snow isn't the only thing to worry about. \"We are going to see high snowfall amounts, but the ice is what is going to be the big story,\" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said, pointing at North Carolina. Raleigh, North Carolina, could see up to a half-inch of ice, which could knock out power and \"makes travel nearly impossible,\" she said. The bitter cold is coming from several fronts. This weekend, the Northeast weathered its fourth snowstorm in three weeks, and extremely low temperatures are predicted to hang around for two more weeks. A winter storm stretching across the Midwest and Southeast is bringing freezing rain and ice accumulation, especially from Arkansas to Tennessee. Late Monday, Tennessee declared a state of emergency as road conditions quickly deteriorated and power outages spiked. Temperatures across the eastern half of the United States will be below average for the entire week, and that's a big deal as winter fatigue sets in. In Boston, where 95 inches of snow have already been recorded this year, the latest storm was expected to skirt by and bring a few more inches, Gray said. This February is the city's snowiest month ever. Frank Ippolito, the owner of a snow removal business operating in Boston, said his staff was weary from lack of sleep. At this point, his snowplow drivers are putting snow \"anywhere and everywhere there's an open piece of land that won't obstruct the view safely of the driver or prevent someone from getting out of a doorway or moving a car,\" he said. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said one man died after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow. \"Please stay close to your home today -- shovel in short stints,\" he said. Mounting \"snow rage\" is pitting drivers and neighbors against each other as the winter weather shows no sign of letting up, CNN affiliate WFXT reported. \"We've been noticing a little frustration out there on the roads,\" Massachusetts State Police trooper Kathryn Downey said. \"I think people are getting pushed to their limits.\" Margo Souza of Charlestown, Massachusetts, told CNN's iReport she was trying to take the snow in stride, even though it has doubled her commute. Her golden retrievers, Logan and Copley, love to bound around in it. Still, she said she was hoping her city's baseball team might bring something with them when they head south for spring training. \"Send the snow to Florida,\" she said, \"along with the Red Sox equipment.\" One New York resident, Max Guliani, posted photos on Twitter of the frozen fountain at Bryant Park in New York City. A pipe burst at the city's iconic Empire State Building, forcing one of its observatories to shut down, a spokeswoman said. In Ithaca, in upstate New York, temperatures have gotten so cold that even the city's tourism website is telling people to head to the Sunshine State. \"That's it. We surrender,\" the website says. \"Winter, you win. Key West anyone?\" Do you see mountains of snow or freezing rain outside your window, but have friends in Florida or California who don't understand the big deal with the severe winter weather? Pick a weather factoid to share with them (via CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller): . \u2022 Wind chills in the Northeast make it feel as cold as -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius). \u2022 Monday was the coldest morning in Boston since 2004, at -3 degrees Fahrenheit (-19 Celsius). \u2022 More than 55 million people live in areas that are currently under a wind chill warning or advisory. \u2022 An additional 50 million are under winter storm warnings, stretching from Oklahoma to South Carolina and up to New Jersey. As a weary Northeast remains buried in snow, the South and Midwest are gearing up for a messy mix of snow, sleet and ice. Snowfall records have been broken in the Northeast, and now, more than a dozen other states, stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma to North Carolina and Virginia, are bracing for inclement weather. \"It's been about 10 years since we've had something this significant,\" said Doug Hamilton, chief of public services in Louisville, Kentucky. In Lexington, plows are working around the clock, Mayor Jim Gray told CNN affiliate WLEX. Already, he said, parts of the city have seen between 6-11 inches of snow, which he described as \"very unusual.\" Southern Indiana could see up to 10 inches of snow, while northern Kentucky faces between 8 and 14 inches, the National Weather Service said. \"Travel will be treacherous with some roads nearly impassable,\" the National Weather Service warned. \"Have an emergency kit of blankets, food, water and flashlights if you must travel.\" In addition to slick roads, trees may come down because of snow accumulations, causing power outages. Forecasters warned residents in affected areas to defer travel on rural roads until Tuesday. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley ordered various agencies on alert, including the  Emergency Management Agency,  the state National Guard and law enforcement agencies. \"State agencies are on standby to coordinate resources to support the needs of Alabama counties if necessary,\"  he said. In Missouri, St. Louis braced for heavy snow Monday, possibly into overnight, CNN affiliate KMOV reported. School districts in cities such as Little Rock, Arkansas, shut down in expectation of wintry weather. Nashville saw relentless freezing rain starting before dawn Monday, and snowplows were already at work. Three to 7 inches of snow are forecast there in the next 24 hours. Southwest Airlines on Monday canceled all flights to and from Nashville International Airport, airport spokeswoman Shannon Sumrall said. Southwest accounts for more than half of the commercial flights at the airport, she said. Only a handful of Delta and American Airlines flights departed Monday. Wintry weather is in the eye of the beholder. The Northeast is urging drivers to stay off roads as the fourth storm in three weeks drops snow that, for Boston, has exceeded 45 inches in February alone. It takes a fraction of that to get residents in the South into emergency mode. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to snow; just the possibility of wintry weather is enough for a partial shutdown. The Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for northern Georgia, warning of potential snow and ice accumulation on the roads. Temperatures dropped in the Atlanta area Monday, and even though the forecast suggested the snow/ice mix would fall farther north, some school districts closed out of caution. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 15 northern Georgia counties and asked state workers there to work from home if they're not involved in emergency response. \"The danger, of course, with moisture on our roadways and the temperature dropping, is the fear of black ice,\" Deal said, according to CNN affiliate WSB. \"And that is the most significant threat that we see.\" Residents loaded up on food and other supplies, memories of last year's storm probably fresh in their minds.

Like the Yarnell hotshots, we charged toward the fires, lugging heavy packs and swinging heavy tools, digging firelines and felling trees, separating the fuels from the fires. My first jump fire was a two-manner, high on Mogollon Baldy Peak in New Mexico. Roger Mello and I fought a small lightning fire, until another huge bolt exploded a ponderosa pine tree right below us in a blast so bright that I saw its afterimage for an entire minute. We put out that fire and then were helicoptered out, to land in front of magnificent and ancient cliff dwellings. I was hooked, just like thousands of other wildland firefighters. There were always close calls. In Alaska, with a fire pressing us, we built an island of rocks out in a small lake and stood on it to let the fire blow past us. On another fire call, our Twin Beech crash-landed on the edge of the Yukon River. We squeezed out through a wing window as the plane began to burn. In Idaho's River of No Return Wilderness, with the fire heating up below us, we sawed down a dead tree and used its trunk as a battering ram to bust up a granite reef and build a helicopter landing pad. Of course, we should not have been up on that ridge top with the fire cooking below us. The phrase, \"And there we were ...\" whispers the cause of almost every firefighting fatality. Firefighters sometimes go -- and sometimes they are sent -- where they should never have gone. Norman Maclean's famous book, \"Young Men and Fire,\" about the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire incident, which took 13 smoke jumpers' lives, reads like a classic Greek tragedy, complete with lessons of hubris and fate. Nonfirefighters often love that book. But firefighters will read it and shake their heads. All we can think is that they shouldn't have gone down there. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . Firefighting deaths are never classical tragedies. However, those who perish fighting fires are indeed heroes. Their last moments are pinnacles of high emotion and drama. Hold your breath and imagine it. In 1994, a fire crew was caught on Colorado's Storm King Mountain by a fire flashing up through brush that had already burned once. Some sheltered. Some ran. Two made it out over the ridgetop. When rescuers arrived, they found a surreal scene. The bodies they found lower on the slope were burned beyond recognition. Those they found higher had been caught in a blast that was extreme but brief. Their bodies appeared as though they had been bronzed. They looked like Rodin statues, cast in their last moments of heroic, doomed struggle. There they were. And there the Yarnell 19 were, on their Arizona fire last Sunday where they should not have been. And yet they were so right to want to be there. They were more alive than most of us are, more vital, more committed and more sincere in their lives. They fought fire to protect others' lives and property. They shouldered the burden and faced the dangers. As heroes do. God bless the Yarnell 19. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clay Morgan."}]}

The first comprehensive assessment of \u2018health tourism\u2019 says the true cost to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates. It concluded the Health Service has \u2018some of the most generous rules in the world\u2019. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. Costly: A report estimated the health tourism costs the NHS up to \u00a32billion a year . The bill was put at between \u00a31.9billion and \u00a32billion\u00a0 \u2013 with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back. The Government said it would be \u2018impractical or inappropriate\u2019 to charge in full some patients, such as students or those with infectious diseases. However Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hopes to recover up to \u00a3500million a year, arguing Britain cannot afford an \u2018international health service\u2019. The study estimates that \u00a3388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged. Health tourists \u2013 those who specifically travel to the UK for treatment \u2013 cost up to \u00a3300million more. The Home Office plans a new annual levy of \u00a3150 on foreign students and \u00a3200 on temporary migrants. The surcharge is expected to generate \u00a3200million. Extra strain: According to Professor Thomas, the NHS levy will make coming to the UK for treatment even more attractive . Angry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt vows to recover \u00a3500m and blasts our 'international health service' Today's findings will prove highly controversial \u2013 and are likely to be hotly disputed by the Left-wing medical establishment. Labour suggested earlier this year . that the Government was \u2018xenophobic\u2019 for proposing charges for more . temporary visitors and migrants. The situation is complex when it . comes to deciding in practice who is and who is not eligible for free . NHS hospital treatment. Data on migrants in the UK is limited, and that . which has previously been compiled is of very poor quality. The Government admits that today\u2019s . twin reports on the scale of the problem are, by definition, based on . incomplete information and a series of assumptions and must be treated . with some caution. The documents concede that the . definition of \u2018health tourists\u2019 can vary widely, applying to people who . come here deliberately to obtain free healthcare, and others who are . simply frequent visitors who register with GPs. Researchers conducted telephone . interviews with 36 senior officials at a cross-section of NHS trusts, . and interviews with nine Border Force and immigration enforcement . officers based at five major airports.\u00a0 Seven trusts involved the study . were visited and a range of staff, from clinicians through to front line . staff, were interviewed face-to-face. To collect data about the number of . migrants and overseas visitors in a more consistent way; a \u2018diary\u2019 was . distributed to NHS staff taking part in the study inviting them to keep a . record of all patients brought to their attention over a two-week . period. Mr Hunt said: \u2018Having a universal . health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the . world, but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking . British taxpayers who fund it. \u2018It\u2019s . time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service \u2013 not an . international one. With the NHS already under pressure from an ageing . population, it cannot be right that large amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money is . being lost through treating people who should be paying from foreign . countries.\u2019 Ministers have . appointed Sir Keith Pearson, former chief of the NHS Confederation, as . an adviser on \u2018visitor and migrant cost recovery\u2019. He will bring in . measures to identify those who should pay and find ways of making them . do so. Estimates of the cost of \u2018health tourism\u2019 have varied from \u00a320million to \u00a3200million, sparking much political controversy. Kailash . Chand, of the British Medical Association, insisted earlier this year: . \u2018Believe me, there is little evidence that health tourism is a . significant burden on the NHS. The \u00a340million allegedly written off over . the last four years by hospitals in England and Wales is approximately . 0.01 per cent of the NHS budget over the period.\u2019 Diane . Abbott, then a Labour health spokesman, suggested charging foreigners . for care was \u2018xenophobic\u2019 and Clare Gerada of the Royal College of GPs . said: \u2018It is important we do not overestimate the problem.\u2019 But even if only 75 per cent of the \u00a3500million target is recovered, it would pay the salaries of almost 4,000 doctors. Free care is offered to temporary visitors and students, unlike in Spain, where students must pay \u00a350 a month. Australia charges \u00a3260 a year for restricted private health insurance for students. The Home Office\u2019s Immigration Bill will create the powers to increase the number of migrants who will have to pay to access healthcare. Labour pointed out that the figures from the Department of Health were based on \u2018incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\u2019. Andy Burnham, Opposition health spokesman, said: \u2018We are in favour of improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment. 'More spin than substance': Opposition health spokesman Andy Burnham dismissed today's report . \u2018But it\u2019s hard not to conclude that this announcement is more about spin than substance. The Government\u2019s own report undermines their headline-grabbing figures, admitting they are based on old and incomplete data. \u2018Instead of grandstanding, the government need to focus on delivering practical changes. Labour would not support changes that make doctors and nurses surrogate immigration officials.\u2019 Earlier this year, the Mail highlighted a warning from a consultant of the \u2018massive and escalating problem\u2019 of foreigners travelling to Britain to exploit the NHS. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of The Royal Marsden hospital in London, suggested in an article for the Spectator magazine that expectant mothers were arriving in this country just to give birth, while others are flying here for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment and leaving without paying. The Government estimates that in hospitals alone fewer than 50 per cent of chargeable foreign nationals are identified."}]}

Krishna Rajarman,  a Fulbright Scholar and honors student, was a junior at UCLA. \"We asked him, 'Why not stay a weekend because we might do something fun?' \" said Ashwin Bhongir, Krishna's roommate and childhood friend. \"He said, 'I want to be here for my brothers. I like to spend time with my brothers, it's important.'\" Krishna, a 19-year-old junior at UCLA, a Fulbright Scholar and an honors student, was found Monday fatally shot at his parents' home in suburban Los Angeles. Police said his father  killed the teen, his two younger brothers, ages 7 and 12, his grandmother and mother. Karthik Rajaram, a 45-year-old unemployed financial services expert, then killed himself, police said. The six bodies were discovered in their neatly tended home in an upscale suburb 20 minutes outside Los Angeles on Monday. A neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job. Inside the house, police also found letters from the father explaining that mounting financial pressure had led him to kill. Fraternity member Vim Mahadev remembered Krishna as a devoted L.A. Lakers fan who occasionally mentioned family problems, but nothing unusual. \"Nothing ever came up serious,\" said Mahadev. \"It was mostly his dad, about financial problems. But most of the time it was how he was his hero because he was intelligent and he always knew the right decisions to make. \"It's just so ironic.\" Krishna's friends Bhongir and Nahel Patel grew up around the Rajaram family and told CNN they never saw signs of family turmoil during their teenage years.   \"I knew his family very well, and every time I went there, it was one of the most welcoming homes I've ever been to,\" said Bhongir. \"It was always a fun loving place to be.\"   \"He was one of the most promising friends that I ever knew, he was literally the smartest person I've ever known,\" said Bhongir. \"He was going to make it.\" Bhongir and Nahel, both business economic majors at UCLA, said Krishna's father was a role model to them. Krishna had wanted to follow his father's footsteps in studies and career. The father received his MBA from UCLA in 1987, according to UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton. Police said he went on to work in a financial holding company and for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse. As a freshman, Krishna joined the campus co-ed fraternity Delta Phi Beta, organized by South Asian students. Fraternity member Natasha Parikh said she was one of Krishna's closest friends.  \"I just talked to him on Wednesday, and he was so excited about the new recruits we were having,\" she said. \"He was so excited about this year, and it's so painful that he can't be here to experience the rest of our time at UCLA.\" \"He really didn't talk about his personal life; I always saw him as a happy guy who never once said he was going through any major difficulty, so this has come as a complete shock.\""}]}

Beyond just the volume of the show -- which was considerable -- the theme prevailed through the set, built around a giant speaker cabinet; the costumes (mostly neon and shiny); and the entire production itself: a gloriously over-the-top spectacle perfectly befitting the singer, who seems to produce chart-toppers by the dozen. The show began with a blitzkrieg of video, as four hanging, shifting circular video screens joined four giant stationary ones is projecting Rihanna's arrival. She wore an electric blue mini-trenchcoat and hot pink stilleto boots with neon green heels and immediately belted out her Number One hit, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" from her 2010 album, also titled \"Loud.\" Photos: Rihanna's Best Looks . Before the audience could catch its breath, the singer had tossed the trench, revealing a day-glo bikini, picked up a gang of matching day-glo-covered back-up dancers and shifted directly into \"Disturbia,\" another Number One hit, this one from 2007's \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" -- and then seamlessly segued into another hit, 2007's \"Shut Up and Drive,\" replete with back-up dancers dressed as crash-test dummies bashing a neon-graffiti-covered car with bats. Over nearly two hours -- a very long set for such a busy production -- Rihanna maintained a relentless pace, working her way through 24 songs, six different wardrobes and endless set changes, all without any significant energy dip. The deft production included several built-in musical and video interludes -- including a staggering number of guitar solos -- to keep from going dark during the changes. Excerpts from Rihanna's Rolling Stone Cover Story . One of the most impressive spectacles was a very erotic S&M-themed mini-set, launched with a fairly faithful cover of Prince's \"Darling Nikki,\" during which Rihanna, dressed in a tuxedo and toting a cane, spanked, groped and pretended to smack three nearly nude female dancers. By the time she had transitioned into \"Loud's\" \"S&M\" -- another Number One hit -- Rihanna's tux had been stripped off to reveal a white bondage corset and she was wearing handcuffs. Nearly nude men and a female audience member were added to the mix before the whole thing ended (cutely) in a pillow fight. In a military-themed mini-set including 2009 hit \"Hard,\" Rihanna rode in atop a double-barreled pink tank that shot T-shirts into the crowd, flanked by sexy-soldier costumed dancers with pink rifles. When \"Breakin' Dishes\" segued into \"Glamorous Life,\" the singer barreled to the back of the arena, where she rode a platform revealing Sheila E-style stand-up drums and played an impressive solo. Video: Rihanna's Hot Rolling Stone Cover Shoot . Soon, she was on to outfit six -- a gold lam\u00e9 mini-dress -- and her encore, which moved from her Number One hit with Eminem, \"Love the Way You Lie,\" to her Number One hit with Jay-Z, \"Umbrella.\" It was understated compared to the rest of the show -- with only a squadron of tuxedoed back-up dancers and a blizzard of pink confetti -- but it was impressive that she was still singing and dancing at such a pace. It was a even more remarkable that there were still more huge hits left to play. She did each one proud. Copyright \u00a9 2010 Rolling Stone."}]}

Back in 2001 -- in the 16th game of the fifth set -- members of Goran Ivanisevic's entourage asked for divine intervention as the Croatian sought to close out the encounter against Australia's Patrick Rafter and end years of Wimbledon heartache. Ivanisevic himself asked for help from above, he wanted the same ball when serving, and Australian and Croatian spectators on Centre Court roared encouragement between points to make for a football like atmosphere. Ivanisevic had lost three previous Wimbledon finals and seemed destined to miss out on glory at the All England Club given he had struggled with a shoulder injury earlier in 2001 and contemplated retirement. His ranking of 125th wasn't even high enough to land direct entry into the tournament. Wimbledon gave Ivanisevic a wildcard, however, and he proceeded to work his way through the draw with a little help from Wimbledon's famed and all too frequent rain gods. So there he was against Rafter on \"People's Monday,\" leading 8-7 in the fifth set, four points from winning the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. No ordinary player -- and character -- one sensed that if Ivanisevic held serve, he would do it the hard way. He had to overcome a resilient Rafter -- and painful memories of defeats to Pete Sampras, twice, and Andre Agassi. It proved to be the case. A forehand volley went long by a large margin for 0-15. At 15-all, he double faulted. Having hit an ace to get to championship point, he subsequently double faulted again -- by a yard. A second championship point came and went with another double fault, this time into the net, and a third was saved by Rafter with a lob that was good enough against an Ivanisevic too frozen to jump. Rafter finally buckled on a fourth match point, the pressure from Ivanisevic's destructive serve finally too much to repel. A return sailed into the net and Ivanisevic was the Wimbledon champion and the only wildcard to bag the men's title at noted postcode SW19. Dedication to a fallen friend . He worked his way into his players' box and exchanged hugs with his team, which included father Srdjan, who had recently undergone a triple heart bypass. Ivanisevic dedicated the victory to former NBA star Drazen Petrovic, who died in a car accident in 1993. \"The best moment is when you hold the trophy,\" Ivanisevic told CNN's Open Court before the start of Wimbledon. This year's men's final will be played on Sunday. \"I was watching too many guys holding that beautiful trophy. I had this (runner-up) plate at home,\" added Ivanisevic. \"It's a nice plate but you don't want to have that plate at home. \"Nobody cares for second place. If you want to go back now and think of Wimbledon finalists in the past 15 years, to be honest, I have no idea.\" Ivanisevic almost didn't get that far. He trailed Britain's Tim Henman two sets to one in the semifinals, losing the third 6-0 in about 15 minutes. He was out of sorts. That's when the unpredictable British weather saved Ivanisevic and hurt the local darling. With Henman holding a 2-1 advantage in the fourth set on the second Friday of the fortnight, rain fell and the contest was suspended. They returned Saturday and Ivanisevic, mentally fresher, claimed the fourth set in a tiebreak. A further suspension ensured the nervy affair had to be completed Sunday, with Ivanisevic eliminating Henman 6-3 in the fifth to disappoint a nation. A Monday final beckoned against Rafter, himself a loser to Sampras -- the king of Wimbledon prior to Roger Federer's arrival -- in the 2000 finale. Fans queued up overnight to land one of the 10,000 unreserved tickets made available for the final, leading to a more vocal climax than usual. \"It was good that it was on a Monday because three finals I lost on Sunday, so finally I played on Monday,\" Ivanisevic said. \"Unbelievable atmosphere, probably never again because now they have a roof. \"Patrick is a very good friend, a great guy. We both should have won Wimbledon before, him in 2000 in the final, and I was supposed to win a long time ago.\" After Ivanisevic beat Carlos Moya in the second round he sensed something special was about to happen. Did it the hard way . Besides Henman and Rafter, Ivanisevic also topped Andy Roddick, Greg Rusedski and Marat Safin in a difficult draw. Of his seven victims, only one -- first-round opponent Fredrik Jonsson -- would never feature in the top four in the rankings. \"It was an unsolved mystery how I won, but I felt after the second round that I was going to win,\" Ivanisevic said. \"I could not say it loud because they would think I was completely nuts. \"I felt for the first time after so many months, actually a year, the racket (that I played with had a special sound). I lost the sound for a year and a half and that (first) Monday I got the sound back. I said, 'This is a good sign.'\" The sound had vanished when Ivanisevic began the year by playing in qualifying at the Australian Open. Stuck on a back court after playing in some of the world's grandest stadiums, he tanked -- a tennis term for not trying. Although unpleasant at the time, it proved to be that year's turning point for Ivanisevic. \"I had a long journey to think about what I was going to do, then I went to play a challenger in Germany,\" Ivanisevic said. \"I played the final. Then I started to play better. I didn't have great results but I started to enjoy it again. \"Wimbledon came and it was actually my time,\" added Ivanisevic, who can still be seen on the seniors' tour, while he also helps run a tournament in Zagreb and dabbles in commentating. \"It was written somewhere that it was my time. I did everything in my life the harder way. Why do it easy if you can do it the hard way?\" But by doing it the hard way, the larger-than-life Ivanisevic has ensured his achievement at Wimbledon will never be forgotten."}]}

Harvey died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, where he kept a winter home, said Louis Adams, a spokesman for the networks. He was surrounded by family members when he died, Adams said.

Look to a place where the housing collapse began: Phoenix, Arizona. \"We're talking about (home) prices being 3 to 4% higher than last year, which most people don't believe because they're used to bad news,\" said Mike Orr, director of Arizona State University's Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice. Orr's new report on the Phoenix market shows a direct reverse of the situation that sparked a massive housing bubble. Monthly foreclosure starts have fallen 49% since a year ago. Home sales are up 8%. The result? What had been a market with far more housing supply than demand has now become a place where buyers have to act fast and beat out heavy competition. CNN Radio's Lisa Desjardins reports on the turnaround in Phoenix . \"It's no longer difficult to sell your house here,\" Orr told CNN Radio. \"If you price it at market, it well sell quickly. The supply situation is unusually low.\" Supply is down some 42%, Orr estimates, from September 2008. Top 10 turnaround towns . That is a dramatic turnaround for an area that once had a massive supply glut. According to Orr's predecessor at ASU, Jay Butler, during the recession foreclosures hit an eye-popping 12% of the homes in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. But now Orr's report indicates that supply has been soaked up and Phoenix is again becoming a seller's market where buyers must stand in line and move fast. \"(The listing) came out on the market on a Friday morning. We looked at it Friday afternoon and put a bid on it Friday night,\" said homeowner Tim Woodward of his new house. He and his fianc\u00c3\u00a9, Susan Rust, are combining their two families, which includes five teenage girls who will all live at home. \"So we need space,\" Rust said. She and Woodward had already lost bids on other homes and decided to put in a contract on what would become their home while sitting in the driveway after their walk-through. \"According to the neighbors, there were 11 other couples who went through this house,\" Rust said. \"So you have to be quick.\" BofA to slash mortgage balances by $100,000 or more . Rust and Woodward got their five-bedroom, three-bath house in Tempe for $290,000, 40% less than the asking price a few years ago. But neither the homeowners nor the experts think buyers are getting bargains anymore. They believe prices have already passed their low point, hit their natural floor and are rising again. This is not the housing market of a year, or even eight months ago. \"It's getting very, very tough to find a real bargain nowadays,\" said Mark Stapp, a Phoenix real estate developer who also teaches at the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at ASU's Carey School of Business. The classic bargains, foreclosures and bank-owned properties, are drying up. According to Orr's new report, the number of homes reverting to lenders in the Phoenix area is down 62% since January 2011. Trustee sales of foreclosed properties are down 42%. \"The market has tightened up substantially,\" Stapp said. \"In fact, I know of investors coming to town and leaving very disappointed because they thought they'd find huge bargains and they can't find them.\" The question is, will this trend last? Orr, a self-professed data addict, says the numbers indicate a fundamental shift in the market. \"If there is a major economic crisis that we haven't foreseen, things can go back to square one,\" he said. \"But this is not just a slight trend. This is something I see as being very significant. And it's starting to accelerate.\" Follow on Twitter: @LisaDCNN . CNN's Susanna Capeluto and Dan Szematowicz contributed to this story."}]}

The shrine on the Las Vegas Strip sprung up spontaneously under the ersatz skyline of the New York-New York casino in the days after the terrorist attacks. Rotating collection of first responder T-shirts from across the country, many bearing handwritten notes, have decorated a wrought-iron fence near the faux fireboat below the casinos' 47-seven-story replica of the Empire State Building for more than a decade. With MGM Resorts International is starting a $100 million renovation of the promenade in front of 16 year-old Manhattan-themed casino and the adjoining Monte Carlo, the memorial will have to go. Onward and upward: Las Vegas is bulldozing a New York-minded memorial to build a replica of a New York park . MGM says it will relocate the memorial. \"We are working with representatives of the First Responder community in Las Vegas to identify and determine an appropriate and permanent placement of the memorial to the victims of September 11th,\" MGM spokesman Clark Dumont said in a statement Friday. The Strip memorial has remained a heartfelt marker amid the plastic artifice of the desert playland.

Preliminary election results from the South American country show President Dilma Rousseff in the lead. But she didn't get the majority necessary to win in the first round. With more than 99% of votes counted, Rousseff had 41.56% of votes, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court said. Aecio Neves was in second place with 33.60%. And Marina Silva was in third place with 21.30%. Exit polls Sunday indicated there would be a runoff between Rousseff, the incumbent, and Neves, a center-right candidate. In a poll conducted by the Ibope public research firm, Rousseff won 44% of votes, Neves won 30% and Silva won 22%. Silva, an environmentalist candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party, had gained momentum and backing from a growing number of supporters leading up to the vote, with polls before the election placing her in second place. She joined the race after candidate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash and was seen as a political outsider who could combat corruption. But while she succeeded in gaining much broader support that polls had initially predicted for her party, her third-place finish puts her out of the running for the presidency. Rousseff, 66, was once a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the early 1970s during Brazil's former dictatorship. With her trademark pixie-short hair style and thick glasses, she became one of most Brazil's most wanted fugitives, branded by some as a \"subversive Joan of Arc.\" She has a solid track record in running the executive office. Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She democratized Brazil's electricity sector through the \"Luz Para Todos\" (Light for All) program, which made electricity widely available, even in rural areas. Rousseff presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil, but she took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent. Streets filled with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators questioning the morality of pumping so much money into stadiums instead of programs to fight poverty and build infrastructure. Rousseff defended the spending, saying the vast majority of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects were spent on projects for the nation, not the soccer tournament. And Rousseff claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty. \"We have also mainstreamed into the middle class no less than 42 million people,\" she has said. But inflation is now weighing down that progress. Neves, a 54-year-old economist, is a well-known name and a career politician. His campaign slogan promises reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country: \"The sure path for Brazil to really change.\" The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country's strongest. His grandfather, Tancredo Neves, was elected to become Brazil's president in 1985 but died before taking office. Neves says he began his political career campaigning at his grandfather's side. \"What motivates me in politics is an enormous love of Brazil, a limitless desire to see things improve, to see Brazil go the right way,\" he says in a campaign video. While he'd been trailing in some polls leading up to the election, Neves said the only poll that mattered was Sunday's official vote. \"Let's get to the second round,\" he said in a YouTube video on Saturday. Both Rousseff and Neves thanked supporters in speeches Sunday night. Rousseff has promised her second term will be different, running under the slogan of \"New Government, New Ideas.\" \"Once again, the people have honored me with their trust by giving me victory in the first round,\" she said. A video posted on Neves' Twitter feed Sunday night showed cheering supporters carrying him as cameras flashed. This has been one of the tightest election competitions in recent years, and it's likely to intensify in the coming weeks, with both candidates vying for the votes that went to Silva in the first round. There will be three more weeks of campaigning before the runoff. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta."}]}

When the Human Rights Watch interviewer and his colleagues returned home, they titled their report \"They burned my heart: War crimes in Northern Idlib during peace plan negotiations.\" \"Those words were chosen because what we saw and heard evidence of were systematic executions and torture -- war crimes -- by the Syrian government forces,\" he said. \"It's been frustrating to record these stories and then hear more negotiating,\" said Solvang, who describes in a video what he saw. \"I think it's clear that there are attempts to undermine the peace plan.\" This week, a bomb exploded near a United Nations convoy of workers tasked with monitoring whether a peace plan is working. On Thursday, two car bombs also exploded outside a key government intelligence compound in Damascus. For much of the 14-month uprising, the capital city, home to many al-Assad supporters, has been largely untouched by the violence. Thursday's explosions, which killed more than 50 people, are believed to mark a major point in the conflict. More violence came Friday, according to an opposition group. Five people in Homs and Hama were killed by government forces: Three were shot by snipers, and two were tortured to death, a spokesperson said. The architect of the peace plan, Kofi Annan, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, has said that he is now weighing an invitation to meet with al-Assad. Al-Assad's government faults \"terrorists,\" the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces' crackdown. His regime has banned foreign journalists, and several of those who've attempted to report on what's happening in Syria have been injured or killed. Solvang and his team knew the risk they took in entering Syria. They avoided checkpoints and kept a low profile. They visited homes in the province of Idlib and say they hundreds of ruined homes in various towns, many probably from systemic house-by-house arson attacks. Many of the male opposition fighters who once lived in the area's towns have fled, Solvang said. Many women, children and the elderly remain, yet they are being targeted with equal brutality, he said. Several of the 65 witnesses and victims who talked to Human Rights Watch were mothers or wives. They say government forces broke into their homes and executed their families. Three of the victims were children. At 33, Solvang is already an experienced conflict documentarian, interviewing victims of violence in Russia, the North Caucasus and Sri Lanka. He has focused on Syria since the anti-Assad movement exploded in March 2011. But still, he cannot get one mother out of his head. \"She was telling me how the government forces had detained her son and how she had tried to be nice and quiet and cooperative, hoping they would release him,\" Solvang said. \"But as soon as the soldiers left, they told her, 'You have to forget your son.' \" Three days later, the woman found her son's body, riddled with signs of torture, in a village cemetery. \"The courage she had despite (what she went through) and the way she described how she found his body afterward, that made quite a great impact on me,\" he said. Solvang says another mother suffered similarly. The woman recalled how her three sons -- all in their early 20s -- were awakened in the middle of the night by fighters in uniform who identified themselves as \"Bashar's men.\" The fighters demanded to know why the sons owned a pants of a style seen worn at demonstrations. The mother desperately tried to explain that the pants were common, that they were the only style available at the town market. The fighters, she said, ransacked the house and forced the sons outside. The mother ran after them, but the \"soldiers pushed me back inside,\" she said. She describes what happened: \"About an hour later, a neighbor came in and said there was a fire nearby, that the army set some cars and a motorcycle on fire, and the neighbors needed more water. My daughters and I went out with buckets, and then my daughters, who were in front, ran to me, saying that my sons were there as well. \"After we extinguished the fire, we found their bodies. Bilal was shot in the middle of his forehead, Yousef behind his ear, and Talal was shot by two bullets, in the head and in the back.\" The mother told Human Rights Watch, \"I just wish I were killed and I didn't have to see that.\" Several of the victims of summary executions were teenagers; three were children, and several were older than 60, the group documented. Though Solvang has interviewed victims in numerous conflicts, Syria stands out to him because of the estimated tens of thousands of people who rights workers suspect have been unlawfully detained. \"But it's really unclear how many. No one really knows for sure,\" he said. Also unusual is what he says is Syrian authorities' widespread, systematic use of certain torture techniques: Electricity is often used. Syrians have also come up with a name for being hogtied; they call it the \"flying carpet.\" Solvang was also struck by people who victims described accompanying their attackers. These people often wear masks and may be locals or people familiar with the victims. One man recalled to Human Rights Watch that while a Syrian official brutalized him, a man with his attacker spouted personal information about him. \"Ask him about his cousin who happens to be a lawyer who is active with the opposition,\" the man said. Another section of the report details the execution of 19 boys and men in the village of Taftanaz on April 3. Human Rights Watch was able to observe bullet marks near several of the alleged killings: all in a row, about 50 to 60 centimeters above the floor, indicating that the victims were probably kneeling when they were shot. Less than a week earlier, in late March, al-Assad announced that he would implement the United Nations peace plan."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- One of the most memorable moments in the Democratic presidential primaries came last year when a debate moderator asked Joe Biden about his reputation for talking too much. Sen. Joe Biden credits his mother with teaching him to stand up for the little guy. The moderator asked Biden, who was described by the Los Angeles Times as a \"gaffe machine,\" if he could reassure voters that he would have enough verbal discipline needed for the world stage. \"Yes,\" Biden replied with a grin and a twinkle in his eyes. The moderator, NBC anchorman Brian Williams, waited for Biden to elaborate, but a still-grinning Biden said nothing more. Nervous titters spread through the crowd until the audience erupted in laughter. The Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama may be known for his eloquence. But Biden, his vice presidential running mate, can handle himself behind the podium as well. He is known for his ability to throw a verbal punch. Biden, often called the \"scrappy kid from Scranton,\" Pennsylvania, once described as \"bulls**t\" and \"malarkey\" President Bush's alleged implication that Obama wanted to appease terrorists by talking to nations that Washington considers terrorist states. He delivered this savage putdown of former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"  See Biden campaign photos \u00bb . Yet Biden's frankness can end up hurting him more than his intended target. During the Democratic presidential primaries, he was widely criticized for describing Obama as \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.\" More recently, Biden attracted attention for telling a crowd that Sen. Hillary Clinton \"might have been a better pick\" as Obama's running mate. Biden has weathered plenty of public bruises during his 36 years as a politician. But his private battles have been even more dramatic.  See timeline of Biden's life \u00bb . Jeffrey Rosen, writing for The New Republic magazine, said Biden's willingness to mix it up comes from his working-class upbringing in Scranton during the 1950s. Biden's father managed a car dealership and lectured his son at the dinner table about the horrors of the Holocaust. His dad once quit his job when he saw his boss throw silver dollars on the floor and watched his employees scramble for them, Rosen said. Biden's mother taught her son to stand up for the little guy as well, Rosen said, before highlighting a passage from Biden's autobiography, \"Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics.\" \"The one thing my mother could not stand was meanness,\" Biden writes. \"She once shipped my brother off with instructions to bloody the nose of a kid who was picking on smaller kids. Religious figures and authority figures got no exemption. They abuse their power, you bloody their nose.\" Biden took that pugnacious attitude into the political arena. After earning a law degree from Syracuse University, he won a Senate seat at age 29 representing Delaware in 1972 -- in a surprise victory. He eventually became the chairman of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, establishing himself as an authority on national security issues and the Supreme Court. In the 1980s, Biden led the Judiciary Committee through the explosive hearing for controversial conservative Judge Robert Bork. In 2005, one of Biden's distinctive moments on that committee came when he questioned Supreme Court chief justice nominee John Roberts during the confirmation hearings. Roberts, who would eventually sail through the hearings, had told committee members that he was not an ideologue but more like a judicial umpire who called balls and strikes. \"As much as I respect your metaphor, it's not very apt, because you get to determine the strike zone,\" Biden told Roberts. Biden first ran for president in 1988 but dropped out after charges of plagiarism in a stump speech. He also ran for the Oval Office this year but dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. He's serving his sixth congressional term, making him Delaware's longest-serving senator. Biden's private battles, though, have shaped him more profoundly than his political skirmishes. He overcame a stuttering problem as a child. In 1988, he had surgery for a brain aneurysm. A Roman Catholic, Biden carries a rosary and kept one under his pillow during brain surgery, according to People magazine.  Watch Biden's sister describe how he fought his stuttering \u00bb . His most wrenching private struggle took place at the beginning of his political career in 1972. His first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car wreck. In an interview with CNN's Abbie Boudreau, Biden said he even considered quitting politics after the loss of his wife and daughter. Boudreau asked Biden to read a passage from his autobiography to explain how he moved on to marry his current spouse, Jill.  Watch Biden's emotional reading from his book \u00bb . The passage recounts a moment when he asked his current wife, Jill, how she could marry him when she knew he had adored his first wife. \"She didn't hesitate,\" Biden said, reading from his book. \"That's the reason I can marry you. Anybody that can love that deeply once can do it again.\" Biden swallowed hard, cleared his throat and looked down after he read that passage. Then he looked up again, his eyes welling with tears. He told Boudreau that his wife \"gave me permission to be me again.\" \"I know that sounds corny,\" Biden said. \"But she really did. ... She brought me back.\" Biden looked down again and said nothing more. For once, he was at a loss for words."}]}

But a team of scientists insist a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein, tastes good and is a rich source of protein. The food, named C-fu, has primarily been designed to help feed the world\u2019s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050, but its makers believe it could also catch on as a health food. A team of scientists have created a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein (pictured in its raw form), which they say tastes good and is a rich source of protein, so it could be a hit with shoppers . Students from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and the Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada, created the 'bug meat,' composed of mealworms. They developed a technique to isolate the protein from worms and restructure it, to make more appetising C-fu cubes, which resemble blocks of tofu. It takes 10,000 mealworms to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein-rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. The food, named C-fu, shown here as a substitute for minced beef, has been designed to help feed the world\u2019s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050 . It takes 10,000 mealworms (stock image) to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg . Scientists predict that the world\u2019s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050. Farming insects is more environmentally friendly and less demanding than rearing cows, for example. One third of the global population, or two billion people, already eat insects as a regular part of their diet. Thailand, for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers, crickets and other edible insects a year. Insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and B12. Gram for gram crickets, for example, have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat and fans of the food, describe the insects as \u2018nutty\u2019. The creators of C-fu claim it product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. \u2018C-fu is dense nutrition that will help alleviate global hunger and nutrient deficiencies while providing livelihoods for microfarmers and processors,\u2019 the students wrote as part of their entry to the Thought For Food Challenge. Ten finalists were announced, which will compete for $10,000 (\u00a36,625) of seed funding to bring their hunger-beating products to market at a conference next month. Since September 2014, student teams from over 300 universities in 51 countries have been competing to develop concepts to alleviate hunger across the world. It\u2019s hoped that insect-based foods will play a key role, because they are easier and less energy-intensive to farm than livestock such as cows. Traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues, including large greenhouse gas emissions, while insects on the other hand, are very efficient consumers of resources. The team says that C-fu has less impact on the environment than meat, because insects use less land, consume less food and emit less greenhouse gases. It estimates that an area the size of Rhode Island \u2013 1,122 square miles (3,140 square km) used to farm mealworms, \u2013 would feed two billion people. The team hopes that its insect-sourced food will be acceptable to consumers because of its bland appearance and have shared recipes such as C-fu empanadas in blog posts. \u2018C-fu products will enter markets, groceries, and restaurants, increasing demand for insect foods and encouraging microfarmers worldwide,\u2019 they predict. \u2018Demand for insects as raw materials in new products will enable insect commodity markets to thrive and create a whole new food sector and jobs.\u2019 Scientists predict that the world\u2019s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050. One third of the global population, or two billion people, already eat insects as a regular part of their diet. Thailand, for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers, crickets and other edible insects a year. Insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and B12. Gram for gram crickets, for example, have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat and fans of the food, describe the insects as \u2018nutty\u2019. Mexican restaurant chain, Wahaca, has served insects as an alternative source of protein since \u00a02013 and its grasshopper dish (shown) is popular . More British restaurants and supermarkets are choosing to supply insects like crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms. They have been a traditional Mexican food since the time of the Aztecs and are consumed in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2007 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013. In January, it brought back chapulines fundido to the menu, made with one of Mexico's most sustainably farmed, yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers. Chefs cook the fried chapulines (grashoppers) with softened shallots, garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa, which is served with queso fundido, a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas - and stocks are running low. Archipelago restaurant in Cleveland Street has love bug salads, bushmans's caviar (caramel mealworms, blinis, coconut cream and vodka jelly) and a dessert called Medieval Hive (brown butter ice-cream, honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee) on the menu. Grub, an insect emporium in London, sells insect starter packs of mealworms, crickets, buffalo worms and grasshoppers on sale alongside their cricket nut fudge. The company is now supplying insects to Planet Organic, the UK's largest fully-certified organic supermarket. British wine merchants Laithwaite's last year created the world's first insect and wine matching guide, to match Chardonnay to tarantulas, sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz to sago worms."}]}

It's never easy losing to your fierce, local rivals but to see Arsenal players falling out during a mauling by Tottenham was a bitter pill to swallow for the red half of north London. As if Tottenham running riot wasn't enough, the sight of Nicklas Bendtner in a heated exchange with goalscorer Emmanuel Adebayor before arguing with William Gallas made for miserable viewing.

The search for Mr Walbridge, 63, of St Petersburg, Florida, has been suspended following an extensive three-day search by coast guard ships, helicopters and aircraft. Scroll down for video: .

The Coast Guard rescued 14 crew member after they abandoned ship in two life . rafts. Claudene Christian, . 42, was among those rescued, but she died. An investigating officer will now receive evidence and testimony using formal rules and procedures, to try to get to the bottom of what happened, the Houston Chronicle reports.

The investigation will consider whether . any failure of equipment or personnel contributed to Ms Christian's death. It will also determine if further investigation is needed. The probe\u00a0 is expected to take several months. HMS Bounty was originally built for the 1962 film 'Mutiny on the Bounty' starring Marlon Brando, and featured in several other films over the years, including one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Mr Walbridge was captain of the three-masted tall ship, which sank about 90 miles off Cape Hatteras. Claudene Christian, 42, was among those rescued by coast guards, but she died. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Walbridge and Christian families,' Capt Cameron said. The search persisted for days despite rough seas in the hope the expert seaman could stay alive in his survival suit in the relatively warm waters near the site of the shipwreck, the Coast Guard said. The water temperature was 79 degrees on Thursday. The original HMS Bounty became famous for a mutiny against its commander, William . Bligh, in April 1789. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian - an ancestor of . Claudene Christian. Mr Walbridge reportedly believed he could navigate the ship around Hurricane Sandy when the .

With only days to go before his daredevil wire walk across the Grand Canyon without a safety harness and live on television, Nik Wallenda has released a stomach churning video of what his daring feat will involve.

Crowds of spectators have been gathering every day to watch as Wallenda and his team practice for\u00a0 his 1,200ft walk without tethers or safety nets about 1,500ft above the Little Colorado River on Sunday.

For two weeks, the holder of a half-dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of Niagara Falls, has . been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet. The stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous Flying Wallenda acrobat family is scheduled to be . shown live on the Discovery Channel on June 23. Wallenda and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the Grand Canyon. Trying conditions: Wallenda and his team use giant fans to recreate the wind speeds he is likely to encounter . One step at a time: The wire cable will stretch 1,200ft across part of the Grand Canyon . Preparations: Nik Wallenda walks on a practice wire with the Grand Canyon as his back drop, as he trains for the stunt . Although the . humid Florida heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting, the unpredictable winds that whip through the Grand Canyon have been challenging. To try to get a feel for dealing with them, Wallenda practiced walking on his wire cable as Tropical Storm Andrea battered the Gulf Coast. His team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as Wallenda walked on his hire wire. 'I'm . not scared of them,' he told the Santa Cruz Sentinel, as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him. Top of the world: Nik Wallenda walks on top of the ferris wheel at Santa Cruz broadwalk in 2011 . Dream: The member of the Flying Wallenda act achieved his childhood wish of crossing Niagara Falls last year . Stunt: Nik Wallenda crosses a wire to entertain crowds at the Nascar spring cup series in North Carolina . 'I have to respect it, but I would never do what I do if I . was scared,' he said. Wallenda, who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the Grand Canyon for years, says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking. 'Once I get on that wire I get very peaceful ...\u00a0 I look down and look at my surroundings, I hear crowds, I hear people in the audience.' Since his first wire walk at the age of four, Wallenda he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole. His first experience on a wire came before he was even born, when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant. In the final moments before starting one of his walks, he prays, then hugs his wife and three children, telling them he will see them in a few minutes. 'The first couple of steps are the hardest, so there's a lot of anticipation,' Wallenda, who proposed to his wife Erendira as they performed 30ft above crowds in Montreal, Canada, said. Legend: Karl Wallenda, Nik's great grandfather and source of inspiration, crosses the Tallulah Gorge in 1970 . Family act: Nik Wallenda and his sister Lijana learned to sky walk from a young age . He added: 'The hard part about doing live TV is waiting till the director says go.' The wire walker, who has written about his feats in his book Balance, uses a specially made cable, more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats. His balance pole, which weights 43lb, is a vital piece of equipment, increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground. Despite his positive thinking and training however, Wallenda is well aware of the dangers of the stunt. His great-grandfather and legendary sky walker, Karl Wallenda, fell to his death at the age of 73, during a hire wire walk in Puerto Rico in 1978. The legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for\u00a0Wallenda, who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four. His grandfather's belief that 'Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,' has stayed with Wallenda since childhood, and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats. Focused: Nik Wallenda says when he steps on the wire he feels calm and relaxed - even over a 1,300ft drop . The televised sky walk over Niagara last year was watched by more than 13 million Americans on ABC. However, the safety clause in the network's contract meant Wallenda had to wear a harness. 'It was my dream to walk over Niagara Falls since I was about 5 or 6 years old, but part of that dream was taken away because I had to wear that harness,' he said. 'The exciting thing about this event is that I will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever.' Discovery will be filming the live stunt on Sunday in a remote section of the Grand Canyon national park, which is run by the Navajo Nation."}]}

OK, so a long weekend visiting a planet 1,200 trillion miles away, may not be a realistic prospect just yet, but that hasn't stopped scientists at NASA from dreaming. To mark the exciting discovery of a slew of potentially distant habitable worlds by its Kepler space observatory, the U.S. space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology has created a series of posters advertising imaginary vacations to some of them. Rendered in the retro style of classic travel billboards of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the posters depict these distant worlds as pleasurable destinations. The image for Kepler 16-b -- previously compared to the fictional \"Star Wars\" planet of Tatooine because of its dual suns -- shows a space-suited figure basking in the light from the twin orbs overhead. \"Relax on Kepler 16-b,\" the poster says. \"The land of two suns ... Where your shadow always has company.\" Although the planet is depicted as a rocky, terrestrial world, NASA says it could also be a gas giant like Saturn with freezing temperatures that would make it hostile to known lifeforms. A second poster shows an astronaut free-falling to experience the powerful gravity over HD 40307g, a \"Super Earth\" 44 light years -- or 264 trillion miles -- away. The third depicts Kepler-186f (even further away at 500 light years) with a scene of red trees held back by a white picket fence. The planet has been previously described as \"Earth's cousin\" because it's similar in size to our own world. Because it orbits a cooler, redder sun there's speculation that if plants did grow here, they'd be a different color to our own vegetation. Where the grass is redder . \"Kepler-186f, where the grass is always redder on the other side,\" the poster's slogan reads. The posters, available to download for free via JPL's website, are the work of the space agency's visual strategists Joby Harris, David Delgado and Dan Goods, who were inspired by the new discoveries being made by Kepler. \"I  was thinking ... we may be not alone,\" Delgado tells CNN. \"We're entering a new part of our humanity and one of the natural things that came to mind is what would it be like to visit them ... and wouldn't it be fun to make vacation posters. \"It felt like a natural fit.\" Harris, the lead artist, was inspired by the enduring appeal of vintage art deco-style posters. \"I remember sitting in meetings with the scientists thinking 'oh my goodness, science fiction is now becoming science non-fiction',\" he says. \"People gravitate toward those old posters. They hang them on their walls even today and you want to go there. They're a celebration of place. \"So we thought we'd produce some of our own and come up with funny tag lines that would get people dreaming about what it would be like to go there.\" The three posters were released just as NASA announced Kepler's latest discoveries, bringing its planetary tally to more than 1,000 alien worlds since its launch in 2009. According to Delgado, three more posters are in the works, but progress is slow because the theories about what these newly found planets look like can change from day to day. Still, as he points out, the NASA team might not be the only artists at work. \"Maybe on one of these other planets, they're making posters about visiting here.\""}]}

Footfall on Boxing Day fell by four per cent between 2011 and 2013 as people found themselves shopped out by the time the customary sales began. Scroll down for video . Shoppers beg sales assistants for products in Selfridges on Boxing Day last year - but scenes like this could become a thing of the past following a rise in pre-Christmas discounts . The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales . The Boxing Day shopping stampede could become extinct as there are now bargains available pre-Christmas . Retail analyst Springboard said there has been a huge shift in shopping patterns, with many people snapping up discount electrical items and clothing throughout December instead. The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales. The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started. This prompted retailers to bring their sales forward to encourage spending and, ever since, shops have competed to be the first shop to drop its prices. Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches. John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas. Diane Wehrle, at Springboard, said: 'The special nature of Boxing Day is diminishing. It is possibly coming to the end of its life cycle. 'Culturally in Britain, Boxing Day is still a day when people shop, while Black Friday is a relatively new import from the US. 'But Boxing Day is no longer what it used to be, partly because the sales are starting before Christmas, so there is less impetus to rush out to the shops after Christmas, and partly because of the growth of online shopping.' She said high street retailers needed to adapt and give families a reason to venture out on Boxing Day, including putting on entertainment. She said: 'They need to make it an event again so that people want to go to 'experience' the sales. 'They could have entertainers or demonstrations or celebrities to attract people in.' The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started . The mad scramble for cut-price goods on Boxing Day, such as this scene in Selfridges, could become extinct . Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts . The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so. Amazon has predicted this will be its busiest Christmas on record, with sales peaking at 12.26pm and again at 9.02pm, as families download films, music and books on their Kindles and tablets. This new trend also eats into Boxing Day revenues, with many consumers felling they have 'spent up' by the time they fall asleep in Christmas Day. Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts. But retailers were forced to slash their prices in the aftermath of the economic crisis to lure shoppers back on to the High Street. Now, customers expect these sales every December. Accounting company BDO claims that 'consumers have become conditioned towards waiting for promotions before making purchases'. Millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year . The busiest hour on Tuesday will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, with an estimated \u00a31.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street . The December sales have also encouraged people to put off their Christmas shopping, rather than stockpiling in November. It means millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year. The busiest hour will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, according to credit card provider Visa, with an estimated \u00a31.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street. For those wishing to avoid the crowds, brave shoppers could delay until the quietest hour of the week on the high street \u2013 3pm on Christmas Eve. While expensive iPads, Kindles and games consoles have featured among the best-selling items this year, traditional wooden toys and games have also made a comeback. John Lewis said sales of backgammon boards were up 100 per cent on the same week last year, while its \u00a3100 doll's house has completely sold out. Waitrose also reported a 'real trend for nostalgia' as sales of frozen puddings rose by almost two-thirds. A frozen pudding by Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, called the Ultimate Chocolate Bar, is among the supermarket's bestsellers. Based on one of Blumenthal's childhood favourites, it contains caramel mousse, an almond and hazelnut mousse, crunchy chocolate biscuit and a caramel ganache. Meanwhile, Asda said it has also seen a big rise in venison sales, while Waitrose also has a large selection of venison steaks, pates and sausages this Christmas. Omnivorous Britons will reportedly eat seven different types of meat over the festive season."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Words like \"landmark\" and \"historic\" are being used to describe this week's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. More than 40 heads of state, the President, dozens of American CEOs, celebrities, activists and several members of Congress -- myself included -- are participating in the three-day event. Every issue affecting the continent, from combating wildlife trafficking to food security, is on the agenda. Yet, of the 53 hours of official meetings scheduled for the summit, only two are dedicated to the critical issue of governance. That is scant treatment for what is perhaps the greatest impediment to security and economic growth in Africa. It also sends the wrong message about our shared priorities and values. In Africa, electing fresh, new leaders is not something people do often. Consider this: The 10 current longest-serving African leaders have held their offices for a total of 252 years. Three of these leaders (Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan) have not been invited to the summit because they are in poor standing with the United States. Of those receiving an invite, Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni were unwisely hailed as \"new African leaders\" during the Clinton administration, while others came to power when Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office. Needless to say, presidents serving in their 25th year generally don't promote free and fair elections and good governance. Elections are a pillar of democracy and good governance. When conducted freely, fairly and regularly, they give citizens their most effective tool for holding their leaders accountable and pressing policy makers for action and reform. In fact, the World Bank has shown that political competition, primarily through elections, is associated with improvements to a country's business environment. Not only do elections bolster economies, they can improve security. Take, for example, Liberia. Decades of protracted conflict and a deadly civil war resulted from corruption and massive human rights abuses by war criminal Charles Taylor, along with the political exclusion of whole swaths of the country's populace. But inclusive and democratic elections in 2006 brought to power Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state. Now, Liberia is experiencing a much-needed period of political reconciliation and improved security. While Liberians certainly still face a number of challenges -- including the recent Ebola outbreak -- inclusive elections have proven to be a stabilizing force in West Africa. Despite the overstay of too many African leaders, there are reasons for hope. Eleven African countries are planning to hold elections next year, and 15 more countries have an election scheduled for 2016. In the next two years, more than half the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa are slated to stand for re-election. Each election day in these countries over the next two years will be a defining moment for the future of governance across the continent. 5 reasons Obama's Africa leaders' summit matters . The United States cannot be absent during this critical transition. We should support programs that improve the transparency of elections and encourage the peaceful transfer of power, which, unfortunately, far too many Africans have yet to see. Most importantly, the United States should push back on those leaders who seek to amend their constitutions to create imperial, indefinite presidencies. Two leaders most recently accused of seeking such constitutional changes -- Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso -- are in town for the Summit. Allowing them to return home without pressing for free, fair and regular elections would be an affront to the citizens of these two countries. Opinion: Africa and U.S.: Invest in human rights . President Obama once pressed for good governance aggressively. In 2009, when he traveled to Ghana and addressed that country's parliament, he took a \"no excuses\" approach toward African leaders. In an interview just before landing on the continent, the President noted that, \"I'm a big believer that Africans are responsible for Africa ... for many years we've made excuses about corruption or poor governance; that this was somehow the consequence of neo-colonialism, or the West has been oppressive, or racism. I'm not a believer in excuses. ... I think that it's very important for African leadership to take responsibility and be held accountable.\" Nice words, unfortunately undermined by a summit agenda that shorts good governance.

Nigel Ackland from Royston, Cambridgeshire, has had his Terminator-like mechanical limb since last November, but it has now been upgraded to make it more sensitive.

'Since I was first given the hand they have developed it several times whenever someone who is trialling it notices a design flaw,' Mr Ackland said. 'I was walking the dog and he took off chasing something ripping the lead out of my hand - but unfortunately the fingers came off too.

Then, in May last year, Leeds-based prosthetics company RSLSteeper approached the beleaguered amputee and asked if he would like to trial their latest hand - the most high-tech available in the world. It has a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual's requirements. Mr Ackland operates the futuristic arm by sending the same signal from his brain he used to operate his original, human arm. The thought flexes muscles in his upper arm, movements which are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements. The different patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a thumb and forefinger pincer motion that is lighter or heavier according to how the user tenses their upper arm. Card sharp: Mr Ackland, a former smelter, lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at the Johnson Matthey smelting plant in 2006 . A video of Mr Ackland usin the hand has already notched up two million hits on YouTube. Nigel Ackland's bebionic3 myoelectric hand is the most high-tech prosthetic available anywhere in the world. It is controlled by the same signals from the user's brain that would have been used to operate his original, flesh and blood arm. When the muscles in the upper arm are flexed by the thoughts, these movements are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements. The different grip patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a pinching motion, according to how the user tenses their upper arm. Mr Ackland is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four-month trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made publicly available. The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual\u2019s requirements. To make it look as natural as possible the hand can be covered with a realistic silicone skin, available in 19 different shades, although Mr Ackland has not been given one for the trial. 'Being a hit on YouTube is great - . people need to learn about what is out there and if it helps someone I . don't mind being on the web,' he said. 'After the video was posted and the first press stories a man from Canada began emailing me and he is now trialling the arm out there. 'Some people don't understand is how alienating loosing a limb can be and how the negative associations we have with hooks. 'When you think of fictional characters with a hook you have Captain Hook - well he's basically a terrorist - with this device people see the future. 'People will stop and say its like I-robot and the terminator, how they associate is half the battle with people understanding prosthetic limbs. 'When you first lose a limb it can take a massive blow to your confidence. 'People in the street don't really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and as a result you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn. 'With the Terminator arm people will come up and ask you about it. 'I no longer feel like someone people avoid because they don't know what to say to me. 'It would be great if when a person did lose an arm, they got an arm like straight away.'

According to published reports, since January, several CIA operatives involved in the missions in Libya have been forced to submit to multiple polygraph tests - in some cases, operatives were given a test on a monthly basis. According to sources with direct knowledge of the situation, the agency is questioning operatives to find out whether they are talking about Benghazi with the media or with members of Congress, which just demanded that an investigation into the terrorist attack be a priority of the FBI's new director, James Comey. What Happened? Nobody seems to know exactly what happened during the Benghazi attack - and the CIA seems to want to keep it that way . According to CNN - which broke the story about the number of operatives on the ground the night of the attack, and the CIA's frequent use of polygraphs - a CNN operative who passes information on to Congress or the media faces career-ending consequences. One of CNN's sources described the CIA's attempts to keep elements of the Benghazi attack as 'unprecendented.' 'You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation,' one source said. Another source described the CIA's tactics as 'pure intimidation.' In internal communications obtained by the network, one insider writes, 'You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.' Tragedy: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terrorist attack on the embassy in Benghazi . Terror: The Obama Administration refused to call the Benghazi attack 'terror' for several weeks after the assault . According to former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer, agents are generally questioned once every three to four years, 'never more than that.' 'If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's . called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division . suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a . fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be . polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,' Baer continued. The CIA denies that it is trying to keep things from Congress. In a statement, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd insists that the agency has 'worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an . extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi.' 'CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,' the . statement continued. 'The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi . the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA . employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine . security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern . with Congress about the Benghazi incident.' According to one CNN source, there were as many as 35 CIA operatives on the ground in Benghazi on the night of the attack, with up to seven wounded, in some cases seriously. At least 21 were in the building known as the Annex. Foreign Serviceman Sean Smith also was killed during the attack . The actual number of operatives in Benghazi that night remains a mystery, though, as well as what - exactly - they were doing there. 'We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under . oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any . national security issue involved with regards to that,' Congressman Frank Wolf - who has been seeking answers about what happened in Benghazi for over a year. 'I think it is a form of a cover-up, and I think it's an attempt to push . it under the rug, and I think the American people are feeling the same . way,' he continued. Answers: Congressman Frank Wolf wants people on the ground the night of the attack to testify under oath before Congress . Wolf also says that in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were several people with close ties to CIA operatives and contractors who contacted him wanting to talk. Now, he said, there is silence. 'Initially they were not afraid to come forward. They wanted the . opportunity, and they wanted to be subpoenaed, because if you're . subpoenaed, it sort of protects you, you're forced to come before . Congress.

Leaked emails sent by the party\u2019s Whips\u2019 Office show that in the 54 days since MP Mark Reckless\u2019s defection to Ukip, there were around 100 separate visits to the constituency by Cabinet ministers, including five by the Prime Minister. Some 246 Conservative MPs \u2013 80 per cent of the total \u2013 hit the campaign trail, with so many there that they were asked to sit in offices stuffing envelopes rather than knocking doors, amid reports voters were sick and tired of constant canvassing. Scroll down for video . On October 16, David Cameron introduced the Conservative Party's candidates Anna Firth and Kelly Tolhurst at the Wainscott Memorial Hall in Rochester . On October 24, Mr Cameron attended a community forum in Chatham, Kent, as he campaigns for the Conservative party in the Rochester and Strood by-election with candidate Kelly Tolhurst (second right) In the early days of the campaign, David Cameron was quoted as saying privately he wanted to kick Mr Reckless\u2019s \u2018fat a*** out of the Commons\u2019 and insisting he would \u2018throw the kitchen sink\u2019 at winning the seat. Ukip\u2019s triumph \u2013 its second by-election win in weeks \u2013 shook all three main parties. Nigel Farage declared there were now no no-go areas for his party and neither the Conservatives nor Labour could hope to win next year\u2019s General Election outright. But Tory jitters were limited by the smaller-than-expected majority, with senior Eurosceptics, including John Redwood and John Baron, speaking supportively. Ukip had forecast a win by 15 percentage points or more just days ago, but Mr Reckless won by 2,900 votes, or just 7 points. \u2018It isn\u2019t big enough,\u2019 said one MP sceptical about the party leadership of Mr Reckless\u2019s majority. \u2018If you\u2019re an MP flirting with defection and you look at those numbers in a by-election when people want to kick the Government, you have to be thinking you wouldn\u2019t hold on to your seat at the General Election.\u2019 On November 4, Mr Cameron (centre) with Kelly Tolhurst (left), the new Conservative candidate for Rochester and Strood, were shown around the Crossrail site in Chatham, Kent . On November 11, Mr Cameron spoke to pupils of Strood Academy in Rochester, Kent . And on November 18, Mr Cameron and Ms Tolhurst, visited a company in  Rochester . Mr Cameron said: \u2018I\u2019m absolutely determined to win this seat back at the next General Election. Because anything other than a Conservative government will put our recovery at risk and mean Ed Miliband in Downing Street.\u2019 Bookmakers have installed the Conservatives as favourites to retake the seat in May\u2019s election. Emails prepared by the Whips\u2019 Office show that at least 100 visits were made to Rochester by Cabinet ministers, with each member asked to go five times, and MPs to make three visits at their own expense. The emails reveal that 246 MPs made at least one visit, and most had made several. Mr Cameron said he would \u2018lead from the front\u2019 by doing the same, but his final two visits to local businesses, as Ukip surged in the polls, were notably low-key. Ukip and Labour believe the Tories must also have come close to the spending limit for a by-election \u2013 of \u00a3100,000 \u2013 after holding an expensive open primary vote of residents to choose their candidate. The party also hired no fewer than four shops in the constituency to act as bases. Every Saturday, buses full of young activists \u2013 so-called Team 2015, who were used to great effect in the Newark by-election the Tories won earlier this year \u2013 arrived to pound the streets. One minister was quoted at the start of the campaign as saying it would be \u2018like Newark on crack cocaine\u2019. The Tories\u2019 operation to try to secure the seat for their candidate, marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, reached fever pitch on polling day as hundreds of activists, including MPs, went canvassing. Miss Tolhurst had used a public meeting to appeal to voters from the Labour, Lib Dems and Greens to vote tactically for the Tories in order to keep Ukip out. And on the final day, thousands of glossy personalised leaflets \u2013 bearing the name of each voter \u2013 were sent to likely Tory voters, encouraging them to go to the polls. One MP, who is on the Right of the party, said they and several colleagues were \u2018incandescent\u2019 about a letter Miss Tolhurst sent to voters, approved by Tory HQ. Despite not once mentioning she was a Conservative, it mentioned Ukip twice. It also mentioned \u2018uncontrolled immigration\u2019 and the fact some local people felt unsafe on their high street due to crime, in a way that critics said made it appear the issues were linked. Miss Tolhurst denied she had intended a link. The MP said: \u2018A lot of us thought it was deeply unpleasant.\u2019 Patrick Brione, director of research at pollster Survation, said: \u2018All MPs were instructed to visit the constituency at least three times and over a hundred MPs did so on multiple occasions; David Cameron himself made five visits. The party had shipped in activists from across the country to bombard the constituency with canvassing \u2013 their resources extended as far as being able to pull off a logistically impressive 6am mail drop to households across the seat on the morning of the vote. \u2018Despite all of this, the party failed to retain a seat with a 10,000-vote majority, against an opposition party which had not even fielded a candidate at the previous election. The implications for the Conservatives are potentially dire.\u2019 Michael Gove accused Mair of playing a game of 'political snakes and ladders' on Radio 4 . Michael Gove today accused the BBC of \u2018political game-playing\u2019 after he was repeatedly asked about the Prime Minister\u2019s failure at the ballot box. In a hostile exchange on Radio 4\u2019s PM, the Chief Whip told presenter Eddie Mair he was playing a game of \u2018political snakes and ladders\u2019 rather than asking about issues of substance. After Mr Mair accused Mr Gove of dodging a question about whether he should resign if there are more defections to Ukip, the former education secretary seemed to become frustrated. \u2018Your question was, if I may say so, the type of political game-playing that puts people off BBC interviewers because of instead of asking about policy you\u2019re asking about position,\u2019 he told Mr Mair. \u2018One of the things people dislike about politics is the way that commentators instead of talking about issues of substance, such as employment or inflation, play a game of snakes and ladders, and who is up and who is down.\u2019 Mr Gove said the Conservatives were on course for victory in May\u2019s general election despite suffering a second drubbing at the ballot box in just six weeks. When repeatedly pressed to explain why Mr Cameron \u2018can\u2019t win\u2019, Mr Gove insisted he \u2018secured a bigger swing than any leader since 1930s\u2019 at the last general election and is \u2018winning the economic argument\u2019. He added that \u2018there is no one to match David Cameron in terms of the strengths of leadership\u2019 among current politicians. Asked if he would resign as Chief Whip if another Tory defects to Ukip, he told the programme: \u2018I\u2019m convinced that nobody will so the matter doesn\u2019t arise.\u2019 Mr Gove has previously said that there are not too many immigrants in Britain \u2013 a key Ukip claim \u2013 but he refused to repeat the comments in an interview with Channel 4 News last night. Queue of others waiting to defect gloats Farage . Nigel Farage today predicted that more MPs would defect to Ukip next year. Arch Conservative eurosceptic Philip Hollobone flanked Tory defector Mark Reckless as he was sworn in as Ukip\u2019s second MP, raising speculation he may be next to jump ship. Ukip leader Mr Farage suggested Tory MPs facing a threat from Labour in northern constituencies would be the most likely to see their future in his party, and mentioned a list of five of the most likely. Some have \u2018no chance of winning on a blue rosette but might do on a purple rosette\u2019 at the general election, he said. Asked who he was thinking of, he gave no names but referred to a list drawn up by academic Matthew Goodwin of the five most likely Tories to defect to cling on to their seats. Winner and loser: Ukip leaderNigel Farage, right, and Prime Minister David Cameron, left, today . It includes Chris Kelly, MP for Dudley South, who is already quitting in May, David Nuttall in Bury North, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and Nigel Mills in the Amber Valley. All have denied they will defect. The fifth, Basildon and Billericay MP John Baron, said recently that \u2018you should never say never in politics\u2019. Another who has denied he will defect is Adam Holloway, Tory MP for Gravesham in Kent, who Mr Farage said he had spoken to but would not say when, or what they discussed. Mr Farage did not expect more MPs to join Ukip straightaway, but expected some to reach a decision over Christmas. He said: \u2018I would be very surprised if there weren\u2019t defections of MPs between now and the general election.\u2019 He had spoken to Labour figures, but they were more scared of a voter backlash."}]}

It recently completed its industrial design phase and construction is slated for October this year. \"All technical issues are resolved, all the modeling is done,\" says Ariel Fuchs, education and media director of the SeaOrbiter project. \"We gathered institutional and industrial support five or six years ago and it's been a real institutional and financial project for the last two years.\" It is expected to cost around $43 million and when built, will be 58-meters in height, taller than Nelson's Column, a monument in London. When launched, around 50% of the vessel will be below the water line, allowing for constant underwater study, Fuchs says. \"One of the first users will be the science community,\" he says. \"It's designed to explore the ocean in a new way, mainly spending time under the sea, giving people the opportunity to live under the sea for a very long time, to observe, to undertake research missions, like marine biology, oceanography and climate issues.\" Rougerie's inspiration for SeaOrbiter comes from ocean explorers like Jacques Cousteau and the experimental Tektite underwater capsule laboratory that was used by oceanographer Sylvia Earle in 1969. Earle is one of many vocal supporters of the SeaOrbiter project; others include former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien. The space connection doesn't stop there as SeaOrbiter has enlisted the support of the European Space Agency and other industrial organizations to help develop the technology needed for the ambitious project and its onboard systems. Designed to drift with ocean currents, the vessel will generate the majority of its power for life-support systems and propulsion to avoid other ships and storms from renewable energy, including solar, wind and wave power, Fuchs says. A side project is underway in conjunction with EADS, the European defense and space systems conglomerate, to develop a biofuel as the ship's main power source. \"It meets the requirements of today's philosophy of sustainability,\" Fuchs says. When built, the ship is expected to go to Monaco -- the same place where Jacques Cousteau began his missions. \"The larger education plan is explaining how important the oceans are in to the balance of the planet,\" says Fuchs."}]}

Newsreader Michael Buerk (left) told his I'm a Celebrity campmates how he wished he had pushed disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Saville (right) over the edge of the\u00a0Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship when he had the chance . The 68-year-old BBC veteran made the revelation while discussing his biggest regrets in life with campmates . The BBC journalist  said he wished he had pushed the former children\u2019s\u2019 TV presenter into the sea when he had an opportunity. He said he could have tipped Saville over the rail of the Queen Elizabeth 2 (file picture) During Wednesday night\u2019s episode of the ITV show, he told his fellow contestants: \u2018My other regret is standing at the rail of the QE2 with Jimmy Saville who I personally disliked intensely before everyone else did, and my regret is not tipping him over the rail while I had the chance.' It came after he revealed that his main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager. He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his father, who was dying of cancer, and \u2018feeling nothing\u2019. The father of two, who has been married to his wife Christine for more than 45 years, told the other contestants: \u2018I\u2019ve only one regret in my life and it was losing my mother before I was old enough to have a grown-up conversation with her. \u2018My father was a bigamist and I didn\u2019t really know very much about him, and if she had lived a few more years I would have learned a great deal more.\u2019 His mother Betty, who had raised him by herself from the time he was three, died when he was 16, her heart having been weakened by scarlet fever in her childhood. He added: \u2018It was a complicated situation really. He was a Canadian army officer during the Second World War and he met my mother towards the end of the war and they obviously had a big thing and he married her and I was born, but he neglected to point out he was already married and had a wife back in Vancouver. Buerk also revealed that his other main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager.\u00a0He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his dying father . The newsreader told contestants:\u00a0\u2018My father was a bigamist and I didn\u2019t really know very much about him' It came amid fears he could become the third person to quit the jungle after complaining of severe hunger . \u2018He did divorce his first wife and then we lived in Vancouver until I was three and then, unsurprisingly given that kind of start, something happened, and this is the part I regret, I don\u2019t know what happened and my first memory is coming back on a ship with my mother in 1949.\u2019 The journalist revealed in his 2004 memoirs how his mother had been deceived by his father Gordon when the pair met at a Christmas dance in 1944. The Canadian soldier had spent the war teaching map reading but convinced Betty that he was a war hero with both money and glory to his name. Buerk told his campmates about his father, Canadian solder Gordon Carl Buerk (pictured), and his relationship with him and his mother Betty . He also told her his wife Helen had died \u2013 when in reality, Helen was alive and well in Canada. The couple were married four months later. The truth came out only when Gordon returned to Vancouver to be demobbed from the army and Betty found a letter marked \u2018From Mrs Gordon Charles Buerk\u2019. Helen agreed not to press charges and instead to divorce him on grounds of infidelity. He then married Betty for a second time. However, the marriage broke down in 1949 and three-year-old Michael and his mother returned to England. Decades later, Buerk sought out his \u2018old and sick\u2019 father, finally confronting him in Canada in 1972. He told his campmates: \u2018I got married quite young and we went to Vancouver and I rang him up and he was terribly shocked and didn\u2019t want to see me at all so I turned up on the doorstep and had two hours with him. \u2018Bad decision I think. Because I felt nothing. It was all heavy stuff.\u2019 The BBC veteran\u2019s emotional admissions came amid growing concerns for his welfare. Looking increasingly gaunt, the broadcaster has confessed he is finding the hunger and stresses of the jungle difficult to cope with, fuelling speculation he may become the third contestant to pull out of the I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! Jungle this year. Looked tired and strained, he recently complained about the hunger and moaned: 'I would give my right arm, my left arm, maybe both legs [for food]. 'I'm not quite sure how much further I would go but at this moment that is what I have in my mind. 'I'd dearly love a dish of pasta and a glass of white wine.' Buerk's wife\u00a0Christine, who he has been married to for more than 45 years, has flown out to Australia . There are concerns for BBC veteran as he continues to display a rather gaunt frame in the I'm a Celeb jungle . It came after TOWIE star Gemma Collins quit the jungle after just three days after complaining about feeling starved and worrying about contracting malaria. Actor Craig Charles became the second person to leave the show and return to the UK, after being given the news that his brother Dean had suffered a fatal heart attack. After being made aware that his older brother had passed away at the age of 52, the Red Dwarf actor returned to Croc Creek to tell his fellow celebrities that he was heading home to be with his family."}]}

Two jumbo jets with 1,000 people aboard were just 100ft from crashing over Scotland because all four pilots turned the planes onto a collision course after failing to follow instructions. The transatlantic Boeing 747s were gradually converging on each other side-by-side for ten miles as the crews prepared for their ocean crossings. An air traffic controller who spotted the danger immediately ordered the plane on the left to make a left turn and the one on the right to make a right turn, to move them further apart. But they did the opposite - bringing the two massive aircraft closer together. The two transatlantic Boeing 747s gradually converging on each other side-by-side near Glasgow . Mid-air drama: This diagram shows how the two jets headed towards eachother and at crisis point were around 100ft apart . A tragedy was averted with just seconds to spare when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other and took evasive action, with one plane climbing and the other diving. At one point they were only 100ft apart vertically. When the alarm was first sounded the jets were about ten miles apart. Within a minute, they were less than three miles apart horizontally and closing. Despite a lengthy investigation, experts are at a loss to explain how the crews of both aircraft either misheard or misinterpreted their orders. The near-disaster occurred in broad daylight on June 23 at a position about 30 miles north of Glasgow. Tragedy was averted only when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other . Near miss: This air control data shows how close the planes came to colliding after pilots ignored warnings about the paths they were on . However, details have only just emerged in a report from the UK Airprox Board, which looks into near-misses in British airspace. It concludes: 'It was apparent that both crews had taken each others' instructions.' But it adds the experts 'found it hard to determine why this had occurred'. 'The board was surprised that all four pilots had misheard or misinterpreted the avoiding action instructions despite at least one of the crews reading them back correctly,' said the report. They could not have confused their callsigns as they were not similar, and the radio transmissions were clear. The report said the crews may have been distracted as they received clearances to cross the ocean and settled into their transatlantic routine, and were caught off guard by the alert. 'Expecting only routine information to be transmitted at that time, they may have been perplexed by the avoiding action information and instinctively responded without properly assimilating it,' it said. The board said that the danger to the aircraft was increased because they had earlier needlessly been ordered by air traffic control to fly at the same height - 34,000 ft."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- It sounds like a name-dropping marketer's dream: . Sean Parker -- the Napster co-creator who was played by Justin Timberlake in \"The Social Network\" -- creates a Facebook-connected app and gets celebrities like actress Olivia Munn, the rapper Snoop Dogg (they've got to be Facebook friends, right?) and Joel McHale, the guy from \"Community,\" to video chat on it. That was the scene in New York on Tuesday as Parker and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning announced their new venture, a live video-chatting platform called Airtime. The problem? In the middle of this rich-rapper-plus-rich-Internet-tycoon gabfest, Airtime crashed. A lot. \"Glitch after glitch marred Airtime's first public showing, leaving the event's collection of celebrities riffing and improvising onstage while engineers tried to fix the bugs and revive dropped connections,\" CNNMoney's Laurie Segall wrote from the event. \"Airtime demo = Snoop, Jim Carrey, Ed Helms, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Joel McHale, Alicia Keys, Olivia Munn + a million tech problems,\" tweeted Abby Gardner, from Marie Claire. \"The Airtime has been about 80% fail, but, hey, Jim Carrey is here. So it's all good,\" wrote Mashable's editor-in-chief, Lance Ulanoff. CNET was harsher: \"To launch his new start-up, Sean Parker should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it on fixing his technology,\" wrote Greg Sandoval. A botched demonstration, of course, doesn't mean that Airtime is doomed. But, based on reviews from tech writers, descriptions of the product and a quick test, there's something more troubling that could be bad news for Airtime's shelf life: . No one seems to know why people would use it. How Airtime works . Essentially, Airtime is a Facebook-connected, video-chatting platform on crack. When you log on at Airtime.com you see two video-chat windows, a list of your friends you might want to talk with and a list of topics you might want to talk about. If you select a topic -- like TV's \"Mad Men\" or other items you may have \"liked\" on Facebook -- you will get set up with a video chat with someone else who also likes that show. The same goes for location: You can have Airtime start a random conversation with someone who is on Facebook and who lives in your geographic area. It's like Skype, but you can watch YouTube clips with someone while you're engaged in a video chat together. Which makes it like Google+, except it's attached to a social network that has 900 million active users, giving it potentially more reach. If you're plugged into the tech world, you may recall a website called Chatroulette, which hooked people up with strangers online for quick, random video chats. That site got lots of buzz on this website and others, but it ultimately flopped because people stopped using it for cross-cultural \"We Are the World\" exchanges, and started getting naked. Because Airtime also lets people chat with strangers, it's been called the logical, safer successor to Chatroulette -- one with more clothes. Parker's chat program is tied to Facebook, so it knows your real identity and can ban you in a hurry if you show up for a video discussion sans pants. According to this Forbes report, the site will snap photos of users periodically to ensure that people have their clothes on. So that's how it works. But the question remains: Do Internet users really want to chat with strangers? And if not, is Airtime different enough from Skype -- a video-chat program that's already integrated into Facebook -- to stand out? Serendipity, or sleaze? Writing at the blog All Things D, Liz Gannes explains why the Napster alums think people will want to engage in video chats with people they don't know: . \"Parker and Fanning argue that they are helping bring serendipity into a world where people's online social graphs are set. Airtime is a 'social discovery' application for helping people make new friends online, not necessarily for the purpose of dating.\" But, she writes, it's not certain if that's how people will use the network. \"It's unclear if Airtime will work -- will people want to use it?\" she asks. \"Will it fill up with spammers and skeezy dudes? Is it technically sound? But what is clear is that there are high expectations for Parker and Fanning's next act.\" Sandoval, from CNET, was more direct: \"Cool technology or not, the demand for this kind of service has yet to emerge,\" he wrote. Others are more upbeat about the future of random video chats. \"The excitement of meeting new people with whom you have no 'friends' in common, only interests, geography or kinks, are probably enough (to propel the product),\" Anthony Wing Kosner wrote at Forbes.com. \"Parker told (Forbes writer Steven) Bertoni in an interview Sunday, 'Fun crazy things should happen online.' OK. Let the wild rumpus begin! (Once the technical glitches are worked out...)\" Wired, meanwhile, also sees potential in random video conferences between strangers, particularly because Airtime works to set you up with people who have common interests: . \"When a chat with a stranger is initiated, the service lists both users' shared interests. So, for example, if both users are huge 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' fans, they could both dive right into discussing the pros and cons of William Riker's beard. Interests can be added and removed from within the video chat window. This is perfect if your love of 'Twin Peaks' has connected you with people who are probably a little too obsessed with the death of Laura Palmer.\" The blog TechCrunch goes so far as to say the program will \"re-humanize the Internet.\" \"One minute into using Airtime I was laughing with someone I'd never met,\" writes Josh Constine. \"That's something special when despite all the asynchronous connection, the Internet threatens to make us feel lonely.\" My time with Airtime . In my quick test of the network, I had a different experience. Whereas Chatroulette in its early, non-pornographic days felt fun and random, Airtime felt more stilted. It was almost intimidating to enter into chats on Airtime with strangers who were assumed to have something in common with you. That said, I did have a couple of good interactions. I talked to one guy about the E3 video-gaming conference going on this week. He seemed impressed with Airtime and said it is way better than Chatroulette. But I also chatted with someone who was supposed to be in my geographic area and wasn't. We didn't have much to talk about, so I started playing that mash-up YouTube video of Barack Obama singing \"Call Me Maybe.\" The point, I'd hoped, was that this might give us something to talk about -- or at least we could sway together. Not so much. My 30-second friend hung up on me. If you go to Airtime.com and sign up, let us know what you think in the comments."}]}

Her dead body was found yesterday by an employee in the stairwell, which is used as a fire escape. Frantic: Staff at the hospital are trying to establish how the body of Lynne Spalding was overlooked for so long . Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said they did not know either how long the mother-of-two had been left lying there, nor how she had come to be on the fire escape in the first place, according to Associated Press. She added: 'It's very concerning. We're distressed and don't know what happened. It's our top . priority to find out.'

Actor Rodger Corser plays \"Guitar Hero\" at an April event in Australia. The game has revived interest in rock music. Ulrich may have played songs from those old rock bands around the house on his stereo, but he gives credit for his son's excitement to another source: video games. Myles Ulrich is a fan of games such as \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band,\" which have spawned a comeback for rock music. \"It's a cool generational thing to share that with your kids,\" said Ulrich, the drummer for the multi-platinum quartet. \"My [son's] favorite bands are ... the same bands that are my favorite bands -- the bands I grew up on.\" A few years ago, rock music was struggling on the charts. With hip-hop and teen pop ruling, rock was finding it hard to break through with new music -- or sell more of the old. But \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" have prompted kids born in the '90s to discover artists from the '70s and '80s such as Aerosmith, Twisted Sister and Pat Benatar. The games' amazing popularity -- last year, the two brought in more than $935 million in revenue, according to the NPD Group market research company -- has helped create success in other markets, according to observers.  Watch Ulrich and others praise the games on \"American Morning\" \u00bb . Geoff Mayfield, senior analyst and director of charts for Billboard magazine, said he sees a direct cause-and-effect for some of the artists who have licensed their songs to \"Guitar Hero.\" \"A few weeks ago, when the game featuring Aerosmith ['Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'] came out, there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales. I expect you'll see that again when Metallica gets the same kind of treatment in a few weeks,\" Mayfield said. iReport.com: Do you shred on \"Guitar Hero?\" Once wary of downloading, Metallica has changed its tune with its upcoming album. \"When 'Death Magnetic' comes out in September, you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out, and play it on your 'Guitar Hero III,' \" Ulrich said -- fully aware of the irony, given his band's past litigation with the Internet music file-sharing service Napster. Even in an uncertain economy, the video games also have increased interest in guitars, according to the nationwide Guitar Center chain. And bars holding \"Guitar Hero\" nights also have enjoyed a boost in business: Big Wangs sports tavern in Hollywood, California, reports a 25 percent to 35 percent increase in sales. The results have played out at such places as Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where most teens have grown up on a steady diet of hip-hop and R&B. Recently, heavy metal blared from the school's darkened auditorium as it sponsored a three-day \"Guitar Hero Face-Off.\" Spotlights illuminated the competitors, and an audience full of enthusiasts screamed wildly at the end of each song. It was enough to make 16-year-old finalist George Gomez nervous. \"You got fans cheering you on,\" he marveled shyly. For Mayfield, the marriage of music and video games makes perfect sense, especially for an ailing record industry that's been having trouble selling CDs. \"This is a chance for something that's been a competition to actually be an ally, if you will,\" he said. Mayfield has never played \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band,\" but he said he understands the irresistible appeal of kids and adults indulging in some harmless headbanging -- albeit with toy instruments. \"If you've ever played air guitar, more than likely, you weren't doing it to a Michael Jackson song. You were doing it to an Aerosmith song,\" he said. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this article."}]}

Lord Neuberger, , pictured, said the speed of new technology means we may need \u00a0to consider a privacy law . Britain has no single privacy law, unlike many other European countries.

In a speech in Hong Kong, Lord Neuberger said there had been \u2018astonishing developments in IT \u2013 the ease with which information can be transmitted and received across the world, the ease with which words and scenes can be clandestinely recorded, and the ease with which information can be misrepresented or doctored.\u2019 Media lawyer Mark Stephens said a privacy law enables 'scallywags and scoundrels' to hide their wrongdoing . He said: \u2018These developments may make it inevitable that the law on privacy, indeed, the law relating to communications generally, may have to be reconsidered.\u2019 He also gave a new interpretation on the \u2018law on privacy\u2019 in England and Wales, saying: \u2018If I want to do or say something which I am only prepared to do or say privately, then it is an interference with my freedom of expression, if I cannot do it or say it because it will be reported in a newspaper.\u2019 But Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer, said Lord Neuberger\u2019s intervention could be the first step towards a new privacy law in this country. He said: \u2019I think we can say without fear of contradiction that this is a first indication of new government policy on privacy. \u2018This is very controversial. There is always a debate about whether scallywags and scoundrels use privacy laws to conceal their wrongdoing.\u2019"}]}

The infant was given a tainted batch of a fluid called total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at Cambridge's Rosie Hospital, and died on Sunday after battling blood poisoning for several weeks. Investigators now believe up to 23 babies were fed using the tainted batch at 11 intensive care units across England. Three have died. Tragic: A third baby has died after being given a contaminated batch of drip feed which affected 23 newborns. The latest death was at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured) The baby was fed using the tainted drip on May 27, the same day authorities believe it was delivered by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma. Health chiefs previously believed there were 22 cases - 18 confirmed and four possible - but the infant who died this weekend has now been linked to the ongoing investigation. A . spokesman for Public Health England said: 'Since the last update on . June 12, 2014, a further case has been identified and the total number . of cases linked to this investigation is 23 - 19 confirmed and four . possible cases. 'This baby . has sadly died and our thoughts are with the family. This is the third . confirmed case to have died and all three cases have been reported to . the coroner. Scandal: The babies were fed on a drip because they were too premature to feed, but became ill after being given an infected batch (file picture) 'The baby most . recently identified received the implicated batch of TPN from May 27, . 2014, but did not immediately develop sepsis so did not fit the case . definition of the outbreak at that time. 'However, recent microbiological tests have shown the presence of the outbreak strain.' Produced by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, TPN is designed to feed babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own. The most recent victim of the tainted batch, who has not been named, fell ill several weeks ago at the Rosie, which is on the same site as Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital and run by the same health trust. A spokesman for the trust said: 'Our . thoughts are with the family and we are supporting them during this very . difficult and emotional time. 'A consultant neonatologist has spoken to all of the families on the unit. 'The . babies on the unit have been closely monitored for any signs of . infection since we withdraw the contaminated feed. We are confident that . no other newborns have contracted bacillus cereus. 'The two other babies who were ill are stable and doing well.' Outbreaks have occurred across England, including at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation . Trust, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, The Whittington . Hospital and the Harley Street Clinic. Outside London other outbreaks have been at Brighton & Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Peterborough City . Hospital, Southend University Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and . Basildon University Hospital. The first baby to die was nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush on June 1 at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips . The second was not named but died . midway through last month. Officials said at the time that the death did . not appear to be linked to the infection itself. Investigators have almost finished their inquiry and believe the contamination was an 'isolated incident'. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used to slowly drip-feed patients who are too weak to eat. It is not just used for babies - patients commonly receive it directly into their bloodstream for 10 or 12 hours at a time. It is believed the contaminated batch contained the bacteria Bacillus cereus. The bacteria are often found in cooked foods like rice and soups which have been left at room temperature for too long. They produce toxins which cause diahorrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting when eaten. But because the toxins were injected directly into the bloodstream and the patients were babies with a poor immune system, they would have had a more serious effect. How the bacteria could have ended up inside a medical drip is still being investigated. Professor . Mike Catchpole, incident director at Public Health England, said: 'The main findings . have all pointed towards there being a single incident that occurred on . one day. 'We . are reassured that this was a very rare occurrence as we have not seen . this particular strain of bacteria in any product made since that day . and there has been no further illness.' Gerald Heddell, a director at the Medicines and Healthcare products . Regulatory Agency (MHRA), added: 'At this . stage, our investigation has provided sufficient evidence to indicate . that the contamination was introduced into the specific Total Parenteral . Nutrition (TPN) supplies during manufacture in a particular sterile . manufacturing area at ITH Pharma on May 27, 2014. 'There . is no evidence to suggest that individual ingredients, components or . materials used for the manufacture of TPN on May 27, 2014, were the . cause of the contamination. 'However, . what we do know from our investigation is that the strain of Bacillus . cereus which infected the babies has also been identified at ITH . Pharma\u2019s manufacturing facility and within some of the unopened TPN . supplies manufactured on May 27, 2014. 'From . our investigation to date, we continue to believe this was an isolated . incident and that appropriate immediate action has been taken at ITH . Pharma\u2019s facility to avoid a recurrence.

That ban will be challenged for the first time in court Wednesday -- and activists, as well as artists, some of whose careers were launched on YouTube, are keeping their fingers crossed. Rapper, singer and songwriter Adil Omar is a musician that has relied on social networking sites to launch his career. Even without a record label, he successfully used YouTube to reach both a domestic and international audience -- collaborating with international artists like Cypress Hill, Everlast, Xzibit and guitarist Slash from Guns 'N Roses. Producer of anti-Islam film on supervised release . YouTube \"has put me out there internationally. I've worked with major artists, been in the mainstream press,\" Omar said. But soon after the YouTube ban, response to his album plummeted. \"I'm getting about a tenth of the promotion I was getting before and I have about a tenth of the sales I was initially getting,\" he said. Numbers on YouTube reflect his comment. Omar's last major single \"Paki Rambo,\" released before the YouTube ban, generated more than 320,000 hits. One of his first singles after the ban got just over 30,000 clicks. Protests erupted across the Arab world last year when trailers for \"Innocence of Muslims,\" an anti-Islam film that mocks the prophet Mohammed, appeared online. YouTube is not the only social media website that was taken away from Pakistani Web users. Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr all have been banned in the past. The recent ban on YouTube, however, is the longest-running act of online censorship in Pakistan's history. Bytes for All, an organization that fights for digital rights in Pakistan, has worked to lift this censorship -- running a poster campaign, filing petitions and writing to the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. \"We do not need dictatorial nannies to tell people what to watch and what not to watch and what decision to take and how to take it. Because after all, it's a democracy. It's not a dictatorship anymore,\" said Furhan Hussain from Bytes for All. The ban on YouTube \"is in direct violation of the constitution of Pakistan. It violates the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and freedom of access to information of the citizens of Pakistan,\" he said. CNN reached out for comment repeatedly to Pakistan's minister of information technology but got no response. Omar, like the activists from Bytes for All, hopes the ban will be lifted soon. \"What I'd like to see happen is for YouTube to open up again. For Pakistani artists and musicians to be able to earn money again and make a living ... to be able to reach an international audience again.\""}]}

Really. \"It's my real name,\" the singer-songwriter said. \"It's on my passport and everything. The first question [people usually ask] is, 'Is that your real name?' The second question is, 'Were your parents hippies?' \" Well? \"They were kind of hippies. They were just very creative types.\" Born in Adelaide, Australia, Butterfly Boucher (rhymes with \"voucher\") is the middle of seven sisters and spent much of her childhood moving cities with her family in a motor home. And yes, some of her siblings have equally free-spirited names. \"My eldest sister, Rebecca, came home crying after her first day of school because there were two other Rebeccas in the class,\" she said. \"So at that point, Mom and Dad were like, 'OK, next time we're going to come up with something really original.' So the next sister was Sunshine -- I think that's more hippie than Butterfly -- and then me and then Eden, Angel and Harmony.\" Although she's happy to hear you say her name is a little quirky, the 29-year-old may cringe if you label her music as such. Boucher released her debut album, \"Another White Dash,\" on A&M Records in 2003 but says she was given the runaround when it came to her sophomore release. \"They say [my music] is too quirky. They always say it's too pop for the indie scene and too indie for the pop scene.\"  Watch (and listen) to some of Boucher's sounds \u00bb . After parting ways with her record label and having been allowed to keep the masters of her newer work, Boucher is going the independent route and will release the album June 2 on her own imprint. Called \"Scary Fragile,\" Boucher says, it was completed more than three years ago. She's determined to get it out there in spite of the challenges that come with being a DIY artist. \"The funding is my bank account, and it's not a very big bank account,\" she said. \"But I love working, and I work hard. It's a lot easier to work hard when there's a vision and there's a good group of people behind you.\" Constant encouragement from fans -- via her MySpace and Facebook pages -- has fueled her determination. She's also gotten some breaks: \"Grey's Anatomy\" has used several of Boucher's songs. She performed as the opening act on Sarah McLachlan's \"Afterglow\" tour, and she shared the vocal work with David Bowie on a cover of his hit song \"Changes\" for the \"Shrek 2\" movie soundtrack. And in a show of support, fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman recently showed up at one of Boucher's gigs in Nashville, Tennessee, where Boucher now lives. Currently on a mini tour of the United States, Butterfly Boucher fluttered (sorry) into CNN this week to talk about heartache, grand pianos and nicknames. CNN: What has it been like growing up with a name like Butterfly? Do you feel like you've grown into that name? Butterfly Boucher: It does, yeah. I'm out of the cocoon, definitely, and I'm glad! I do I feel like I've had to grow into the name. Occasionally ... I catch it and I'm like, \"Butterfly! That's ridiculous! What kind of a name is that?\" Actually most of my friends call me Butter or Butters. CNN: How was music a part of your upbringing in Australia? Boucher: It was a huge part of my life growing up. My dad was a musician; he was a rock 'n' roller-songwriter kind of guy. So it's definitely in my blood. I ... remember lying under a grand piano and just listening to [my dad and his friends] record in the other room and just loving this big black shiny piano, just the whole concept of music. I was in dreamland. CNN: One of the standout lines from this past season of \"American Idol\" was when the judge Kara DioGuardi said the music business is paved with heartache. Do you agree with that sentiment? Boucher: Absolutely. ... Artists tend to be kind of emotional people. If it's good art, it should come from your soul, and it's coming from an emotional part of you. So it is very hard. Over the years, I've learned to balance the business side with the passionate artist side, because you just get too hurt. You take everything too personally, and sometimes you've got to make decisions that you're going to compromise things. I get depressed, but then you've gotta get through it. The things that get you through are my fans and the whole generation of MySpace and Facebook. Every day I'm getting just little comments like \"your music means so much to me.\" Every day I get that, so it's a constant encouragement from fans and new people that are discovering you. I have got it pretty good. CNN: Why did you call your album \"Scary Fragile?\" Boucher: It was just a song title of one of the songs. ... There was no real deep reason behind it. I just liked that song, and I thought none of the other song titles sounded like an album. For a while I was calling it \"Just Because,\" and that was kind of lame. I don't want to be too deep with my album titles. I just want it to be catchy and something that you'll remember and then let the music and the lyrics do the rest of it. CNN: How do you like living in Nashville? Boucher: Ah, Nashville! I've been there for about 10 years. In the last few years, it's changed a lot. There are a lot of new people coming in. It helps that people like Jack White are embracing it, and Sheryl Crow. There are so many artists that secretly have a place there. And it's just this great music city. There are more venues, more coffee shops. There are new collaborations, and everybody's idea of what a good song is is changing, which I think is healthy for Nashville. I love it. CNN: What do you miss most about Australia? Boucher: The meat pies! I always crave meat pies. Sometimes I miss the smell of Australia. Although if you go to L.A. you can get it because they have a lot of eucalyptus trees there. So when it rains, it smells a bit like Australia."}]}

The 65-year-old claimed Pawson wanted to \u2018even up\u2019 the teams by sending off Damien Delaney shortly after dismissing Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta.

Warnock felt Pawson (above) tried to 'even up' the sides in sending off Damian Delaney  after Cesar Azpilicueta .

They have one particular person looking at what we say and do, that\u2019s their job. \u2018As long as you don\u2019t question their integrity, and I don\u2019t think I did that, I questioned his experience really or the influence of certain things in the game.

I would imagine from what I have been told I will have a letter.\u2019 Despite Warnock\u2019s comments at the weekend, he claimed he has been impressed by the standard of refereeing this season, though admitted he was surprised Pawson, 35, was put in charge of his side\u2019s fixture against Chelsea. He said: \u2018I have been absolutely delighted (by the standard of refereeing this season). The referees we have had this season have done really well, it\u2019s surprised me. One or two of the younger ones who have been criticised in the past have done well. Even on Saturday, I think Craig Pawson will be a very good referee in the future. \u2018What surprised me a little bit is that a south London derby like that, when we get a young, quite inexperienced Premier League referee, even though he\u2019s a good one. People like Mark Clattenburg have not got a game. It bewilders me if I am honest.\u2019 Warnock says he has generally been impressed by referee standards this season in the Premier League . Warnock contests one of Pawson's decisions on Saturday with fourth official Neil Swarbrick (right) Warnock, meanwhile, has joined the clamour of onlookers criticising the practice of shirt swapping at half-time. Mario Balotelli has been ridiculed for swapping shirts with Real Madrid\u2019s Pepe during Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 defeat against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Warnock said: \u2018I am not a massive fan (of shirt swapping). I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fine anyone for it. There is a time and place for it - probably the tunnel at the end of the game. I don\u2019t see any reason for doing it.\u2019 Palace travel to West Brom on Saturday and Warnock does not expect Scott Dann (knee) or James McArthur (hip) to be fit in time.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- In Madrid, all the talk is about \"La Decima\". In London, all the talk was about the \"Special One\". Tonight, after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season's most romantic fairy tales, Atletico Madrid allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- La Primera -- the first. Atletico, for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival Real, has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the European stage. A convincing 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge secured a place in the Champions League final and allowed the dream of a league and European double to prosper. This Atletico team has guts, resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has, in abundance, is quality. Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. Four points clear at the top of La Liga with three games remaining and a clash with Real to decide the destiny of the Champions League trophy to come in Lisbon on May 24, this is turning out to be some season for Atletico. \"It's a dream,\" Atletico midfielder Tiago told Sky Sports. \"We have a great spirit, we are a great team, we all work together, now we are in the final in Lisbon, the dreams can be true. \"It is not easy to play here, we know that. But we knew Chelsea had to play more. \"We know we are very good away from home. After our goal Chelsea went down a bit, but we were confident and now we are there. \"We know Real Madrid is a fantastic team with great players. They can win the game in any action but we are there. Last year we won the Cup in their stadium so we are confident.\" Not since 1996 has Los Rojiblancos won the domestic title but managed by Diego Simeone, who was part of that team 18 years ago, it now stands on the brink of history. Simeone, who presides over a budget nearly five times smaller than Real, has worked wonders but perhaps even would not have expected his players to record such an impressive victory. To score three goals away from home in European competition is a marked achievement, but to do so against Chelsea, a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition, is staggering. Chelsea, derided for its defensive tactics and considered an \"enemy of football\" by some because of its negative approach, has already answered its critics on numerous occasions this season. A fine victory at Liverpool on Sunday proved once again that Mourinho's tactics, however unpalatable, gain results. But on this occasion, the solidity and cohesion which had caused such frustration in Madrid last week, was missing. The dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that Chelsea had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle Atletico. There is no doubt that Mourinho has been hurt by the criticism and hit back at his detractors by claiming that \"at this moment, football is full of philosophers.\" While everybody appears to have an opinion on Chelsea's defensive approach, Mourinho sticks to the belief which has made him a serial winner -- winning at all costs. The prospect of facing his former employer, Real Madrid, in the final added another subplot to an already intriguing tie. Eden Hazard, back from injury, was restored to the side, and Chelsea, often so adroit at scraping through tight contests, appeared confident. Yet it was the visitors who began the brighter of the two. Atletico, on the brink of the domestic title and chasing a place in the final for the first time in 40 years, played with a sense of purpose and came within inches of taking an early lead. Koke, influential throughout, aimed what looked like a cross towards goal only for the ball to sail over Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and smash against the crossbar. Chelsea responded with David Luiz's overhead kick sailing just wide of the far post as the home side stepped up the pressure. And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, the home side finally made the breakthrough. Willian escaped his marker on the right before finding Cesar Azpilicueta, who in turn found Torres to fire home from inside the penalty area. Torres, who began his career at Atletico and scored 84 goals in 214 games for the club before moving to Liverpool in 2007, refused to celebrate but that gesture did not detract from the significance of the strike. Buoyed by the goal, Chelsea began to take control and with its resilient defense holding Atletico comfortably, the visitors appeared rattled. But with just a minute of the opening period remaining, the game was turned on its head. Tiago, once of Chelsea, picked out Juanfran at the far post and when he crossed the ball into the penalty area, Lopez was on hand to steer the ball home. Mourinho's defense, such an integral part of his side's success, appeared brittle for the first time in the competition and it never really recovered. Within minutes of the restart, Schwarzer was forced to produce a fine save to deny Turan after the Atletico midfielder had found space inside the penalty area. While Schwarzer performed heroics at one end, Thibaut Courtois, on loan from Chelsea, did similar at the other. John Terry's powerful header looked certain to find the net but Courtois produced an astonishing stop to deny the Chelsea captain. That save appeared to change the momentum of the contest and slowly but surely, Atletico began to turn the screw . With an hour of the game gone, Atletico finally struck and grabbed the initiative. Diego Costa, a man constantly linked with a move to Chelsea, was fouled inside the penalty area by Samuel Eto'o. The Spain striker, who endured a nervous wait to take the spot kick after the ball failed to settle on the spot, fired home emphatically to put his side within touching distance of glory. An eerie silence engulfed Stamford Bridge and but for a few thousand Spaniards clad in red and white, a sense of hopelessness began to emanate. Chelsea, to its credit, refused to give up the fight and came perilously close to equalizing within five minutes. Willian's exquisite free kick caused panic in the Atletico defense and Luiz sent a header crashing against the post when the ball seemed destined for the net. Chelsea, by now beginning to look ragged and forlorn, strained every sinew in an attempt to gain some sort of foothold to launch a comeback. But as the home side pushed forward, Atletico countered and in doing so, swiftly put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach. Once again, a wonderful switch of play caught Chelsea sleeping and after sending a powerful header against the crossbar from Juanfran's cross, Arda tucked away the rebound from his own effort. That strike sent Simeone down the touchline dancing a jig of delight a la Mourinho all those years ago. It is a jig he will hope to dance again in Lisbon with the whole world watching."}]}

A notorious Parisian wife-swapping club said to be a favourite haunt of disgraced ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn faces closure for allegedly allowing prostitutes to operate on its premises. Les Chandelles has been shut down temporarily and police have placed three people under investigation on suspicion of 'highly organised pimping'. One of the accused is former professional footballer Alim Ben Mabrouk, 51, who played for Algeria at the 1986 World Cup. Swinging: Notorious Parisian wife-swapping club Les Chandelles (pictured) is facing closure for allegedly allowing prostitutes to operate on its premises . Les Chandelles - which translates as The Candles - is located adjacent to the Louvre on Paris' elegant L'Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra. It is regarded as the most exclusive of the French capital's 50 swingers' clubs and members are reputed to include Strauss-Kahn, celebrities and several politicians. Admittance is only granted to the wealthy, famous or extremely good-looking. But detectives believe the club is frequented by high-class prostitutes and have shut it down until further notice. Paris police chief now has 24 hours to decide if Les Chandelles can open for its annual New Year's Eve celebration. The venue's owner, Valerie Hervo, 44, has been questioned by police but has not been charged.

It's the focus of Junger's new feature-length documentary, also named \"Restrepo.\" The outpost, Junger told CNN's Campbell Brown in an interview Thursday night, was hellish. \"The first time I was up there we were attacked four times in one day. No running water, they didn't bathe for a month at a time. No internet, no phone, no electricity at first,\" he said. Junger said that after a few weeks at their base in Italy, the platoon's members just wanted to get back to Restrepo. \"What was going on up there was brotherhood, very different from friendship. Brotherhood, you don't even have to like the guy, but if he's your brother, you'll protect him, you'll die for him. They all felt that way.\" While \"Restrepo\" is not a political film, Junger does believe NATO troops are making progress in Afghanistan, with violence in the country at a 30-year-low. \"Sixteen thousand Afghan civilians have died because of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan since 2001 -- a horrifying number, but it pales comparison to the civilian deaths in the '90s. Four hundred thousand Afghan civilians died in the '90s... The question is, does the world have the staying power to see it through.\""}]}

Beryl Martin has been re-united with her childhood sweetheart after spotting his name on a CD - 70 years after they last saw each other. Mrs Martin, 90, and Les Hogan, 92, enjoyed bike rides and trips to the cinema as teenagers after meeting at a youth club. But their blossoming romance was cut short by the outbreak of WWII and they lost contact when Mrs Martin left Kent to join the Women's Royal Navy Service in 1943. Beryl Martin and Les Hogan were reunited on Monday at Holy Trinity Church Fellowship, Sheerness, where they reminisced about the old days . As a treat for her 90th birthday, Mrs Martin's daughter Ruth Reeves, 66, took her back to visit Sheerness, Kent, where she grew up, last week. The great-grandmother-of-five was stunned when she spotted a CD called 'Songs of Sheppey' by her first love - 'Les Hogan'. Mrs Martin recognised the name as she browsed gifts in the Blue Town Heritage Centre on April 23 but could not put her finger on why. But the penny only dropped two days later when the grandmother-of-four saw the familiar name again on a book of poetry in Minster Abbey, Kent, called 'Beyond the Skies.' Curious Mrs Martin then tracked her former sweetheart down through his book publisher. The couple were reunited on Monday at Holy Trinity Church Fellowship, Sheerness, where they reminisced about the old days. Mr Hogan, 92, from Minster, Kent, said: 'It was just incredible to see an old friend again after such a long time. 'I thought it was very interesting because not many people make 90. Most of my friends have already taken off. Beryl Martin (then Beryl Tubb) is pictured, left, in the Women's Royal Navy Service which she joined in 1943 . 'We would not have recognised each other if we had not been introduced. 'We just had a cheerful little talk about the old days in the Holy Trinity Church Fellowship.' The retired teacher, who grew up in Hong Kong, added: \"When I came over to England when I was about 16 I didn't know anyone. 'I was a member of Trinity Church and the vicar said I must join the youth club, so I did and that is where I met Beryl. 'I took her to the pictures a few times. We were good friends.' Mrs Martin said: 'I spent four days looking at faces to see if I recognised anyone so it was lovely, just as we were leaving, to meet up with an old friend. 'It seems that we followed the same paths of serving in Navy during the War and then teaching.' Their blossoming romance was cut short by . the outbreak of WWII and they lost contact when Mrs Martin left Kent to . join the Women's Royal Navy Service in 1943. She added: 'It was good and very interesting to see so much of the island because when I was there young people couldn't afford the bus fares or weren't allowed to walk too far from home so we hardly knew anywhere apart from the area we lived in. 'It brought back so many memories.' Mrs Martin's daughter Mrs Reeves, from Worcester, yesterday said: 'My mother procrastinated, but just as we were about to leave she said I should phone the number. 'When I spoke to Les and mentioned her maiden name, Beryl Tubb, he immediately said: \"She was my first girlfriend.\" 'We called in and were warmly welcomed by him and his wife Loy and they had a good chat 75, or so, years later.

In the latest violence, suspected militants killed at least 25 Egyptian soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades in the Sinai Peninsula. Russia's Federal Aviation Agency has ordered airlines to prepare plans to airlift Russian tourists from Egypt, the Moscow Times reported. Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, said it was ready to begin evacuating passengers from the country as soon as it was instructed to do so. Late last week France also announced that it had a plan to evacuate its citizens under review. Travel advice hardens . Russia was among other governments that had already hardened their travel advice on Egypt following the killing last week of more than 500 people in Cairo and other cities in protests against the military overthrow of the government of Mohamed Morsi. Having advised its citizens against traveling to Egypt, on Thursday Russia barred tour operators from selling vacations to the country. Germany extended its advice against travel to the country to include the Red Sea beach resorts around Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh -- areas that have been largely immune from the unrest of recent months and that foreign governments have tended to advise were safe. Last week the government of Hong Kong also raised its travel warning, to \"black,\" advising against all travel. On Wednesday night, following the day of violence in Egypt in which hundreds of people died as security forces cleared pro-Morsi sit-ins, vacationers in Hurghada had letters posted through their hotel bedroom doors telling them to stay within the hotel grounds and that all excursions had been canceled, the TravelMole website reported. U.S. and British travel advisories on Egypt remain basically unchanged. The U.S. State Department continues to urge its citizens to leave Egypt, if they can. Any remaining in the country should monitor local media for updates on the unrest, it says. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against travel to Egypt, except the Red Sea resorts. The FCO has for some time advised against travel to the lawless Sinai Peninsula, where the recent grenade attack on Egyptian soldiers took place, except for the resort areas. Compensation . Government travel advisories are important not only for travelers' safety but because they affect what compensation they can claim. Following the German government's announcement, the tour operator TUI Germany said it was cancelling all trips to Egypt until September 15 and that travelers already in its resorts could stay for the remainder of their holiday or leave early. In Britain, a travel journalist specializing in the Middle East, Matthew Teller, told the Guardian: \"What the FCO does or doesn't say rules the roost in terms of what tour operators can and can't offer clients.\" Travelers were unlikely to be able to change their plans if they were booked to travel in an area, such as Sharm el-Sheikh and other Red Sea resorts, that the government deemed safe, he said. Cancellations . Other large travel firms were altering or canceling their Egypt travel programs, in addition to TUI. Thomas Cook said it had canceled all excursions from Red Sea resorts to Cairo, Luxor and sights including Moses Mountain and St Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. Kuoni, the UK-based operator, has also canceled all Egyptian excursions for 30 days. British Airways has changed its flight schedules to Cairo to avoid the dusk-to-dawn curfew the government has imposed as part of its state of emergency, although tour operators are still being allowed to operate overnight transfers to Sharm el-Sheikh. \"We are also offering customers the option of rebooking to a later date, or to another destination,\" a BA spokesman said. Most tourists fly to the Red Sea resorts directly. Easyjet, which runs flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, said it was allowing some passengers with flights booked to Egypt within the next few days to change their destination. The cruise operators MSC, Costa and Holland America Line have also reportedly canceled their Egypt-bound ships. Tourism vital . The latest violence in months of unrest in Egypt can only do further damage to the country's vital tourism industry, which normally employs around 10% of the workforce and brought in $10 billion in 2012. As chaos has increasingly gripped the country, beginning with anti-government protests in 2011 that led to the overthrow of the Hosni Mubarak regime, tourist numbers have fallen by almost one-third -- from 14 million in 2010 to 10.5 million last year. In further news, the Egyptian ministry for antiquities has closed archaeological sites and museums across the country to protect them from looting, the Egyptian newspaper al Alhram reported."}]}

But up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova's dust\u2010making capabilities. The little evidence astronomers did have could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. Now new images of the famed Supernova 1987A have, for the first time, captured the remains of the exploding star brimming with freshly formed dust. This artist's illustration shows Supernova 1987A, based on real data with the cold, inner regions of the exploded star's remnants (in red) where tremendous  amounts of dust were detected and imaged. This inner region is contrasted with the outer shell (lacy white and blue circles), where the blast wave from the supernova is colliding with the envelope of gas ejected  from the star prior to its powerful detonation . If enough of this dust makes the perilous transition into interstellar space, it could explain how many galaxies acquired their dusty, dusky appearance. \u2018We have found a remarkably large dust mass concentrated in the central part of the ejecta from a relatively young and nearby supernova,\u2019 said Remy Indebetouw, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville. \u2018This is the first time we've been able to really image where the dust has formed, which is important in understanding the evolution of galaxies.\u2019 An international team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope to observe the glowing remains of Supernova 1987A. This image shows the remnant of Supernova 1987A  in light of very different wavelengths. The ALMA Telescope data (in red) shows newly formed dust in the centre of the remnant as Hubble (in green) and Chandra (in blue) data show the expanding shock wave . In February of 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star. In fact they weren\u2019t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from Earth in the four centuries since the telescope was invented. By the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion, known as a supernova. In the two and a half decades since then, the remnant of Supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world, providing a wealth of information about one of the Universe\u2019s most extreme events. Located more than 160,000 light years away, the light of the catastrophic explosion only reached Earth in February 1987. Before it exploded, the star generated huge amounts of gas, including a thick, dense, clumpy ring more than a light year across. Astronomers predicted that as the gas cooled after the explosion, large amounts of dust would form as atoms of oxygen, carbon, and silicon bonded together in the cold central regions of the remnant. However, earlier observations of SN 1987A with infrared telescopes, made during the first 500 days after the explosion, detected only a small amount of hot dust. Using, the research team was able to image the far more abundant cold dust, which glows brightly in millimetre and submillimetre light. The astronomers estimate that the remnant now contains about 25 per cent the mass of the sun in newly formed dust. They also found that significant amounts of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide have formed. \u2018SN 1987A is a special place since it hasn't mixed with the surrounding environment, so what we see there was made there,\u2019 said Dr Indebetouw. \u2018The new ALMA results, which are the first of their kind, reveal a supernova remnant chock full of material that simply did not exist a few decades ago.\u2019 Supernovae, however, can both create and destroy dust grains. As the shockwave from the initial explosion radiated out into space, it produced bright glowing rings of material, as seen in earlier observations with the Hubble Telescope. After hitting this envelope of gas, which . was sloughed off by the progenitor red giant star as it neared the end . of its life, a portion of this powerful explosion rebounded back towards . the centre of the remnant. Last year, a team of astronomers led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) produced incredible high resolution radio images of the expanding SN 1987A remnant at millimetre wavelengths. In this image contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a Hubble space telescope image of Supernova 1987A combined to provide a unique view of its death throes . Cosmic dust consists of tiny particles of solid material floating around in the space between the stars. Unlike the dust you find in your house, it is more like smoke with small particles varying from collections of just a few molecules to grains of 0.1 mm in size. D . It helps stars form, and it is also the raw material from which planets like the Earth are created. Supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But . up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a . supernova's dust\u2010making capabilities, and could not account for the . massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. \u2018At some point, this rebound shockwave will slam into these billowing clumps of freshly minted dust,\u2019 said Dr Indebetouw. \u2018It's likely that some fraction of the dust will be blasted apart at that point. It's hard to predict exactly how much \u2014 maybe only a little, possibly a half or two thirds.\u2019 If a good fraction survives and makes it into interstellar space, it could account for the copious dust astronomers detect in the early universe. \u2018Really early galaxies are incredibly dusty and this dust plays a major role in the evolution of galaxies,\u2019 added Mikako Matsuura of University College London, UK. \u2018Today we know dust can be created in several ways, but in the early universe most of it must have come from supernovae. We finally have direct evidence to support that theory.\u2019 In 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star.

But it's the place to be if you want to enjoy a natural paradise without everybody else. Though it hasn't become a booming destination like Tanzania, Kenya or South Africa, Malawi has numerous attractions. Named one of the top 10 places to go in 2014 by Lonely Planet, Malawi is one of the lesser known destinations on the travel guide's annual list, which includes Brazil, Sweden and the Seychelles. The country is touted for its wildlife and beaches. But there's more to Malawi than animal parks, warm sands and Madonna's adoptions. 1. The locals are friendly . Called the \"Warm Heart of Africa,\" in the native language, Malawi locals exude friendliness. It's common for strangers to wave and greet visitors as if they know them. And it's easy to make them smile with a \"moni\" (pronounced mo-nee, not money), which means hello in Chichewa, the local language, and \"Zikomo\" (thank you). Curious kids often come by to say hi and see what you're up to. The refrain I heard repeatedly was, \"Welcome. You are welcome.\" Although overt friendliness often arouses suspicion in the world traveler, especially when someone's trying to sell you tchotckes, there's hardly any hawking or selling of tacky souvenirs in Malawi -- the people are genuinely friendly. Founded in 1964, Malawi has never experienced a civil war. 2. It's not crowded . You can enjoy the pristine views of massive Lake Malawi -- known locally as Lake Nyasa, it's the ninth largest lake in the world -- without having your perfect day wrecked by a bunch of vacationers blasting horrible music. Instead, you'll hear restaurants jamming 1990s pop music such as the Backstreet Boys -- can't win them all. Another perk: you won't have to jostle for reservations at hotels, restaurants or game parks. Most of the travelers you'll likely encounter in Malawi are tobacco businessmen or NGO workers -- nary a tourist in sight. Even the capital of Lilongwe has the relaxed vibe of a garden. There are few cars and you can walk to places without feeling overwhelmed or fearful of getting run over. (The country's commercial capital of Blantyre is much busier.) You can go from the high life of the Kumbali Country Lodge, where Madonna stays, or sleep in more budget accommodations. 3. Lake Malawi is spectacular . Although Malawi is landlocked, its giant, freshwater lake is its life blood. The sunny beaches of Lake Malawi are golden and the waters are nearly empty except for a few boats. Lake Malawi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's home to the largest number of fish species of any lake in the world, thought to be between 500 and 1,000, according to UNESCO. It's perfect for freshwater snorkeling and diving in clear water. The lake draws in a variety of bird species, as well as hippos, warthogs, baboons and occasional elephants. Not bad company to enjoy the water with (maybe not the hippos). 4. Rehabilitated game parks and natural reserves . Tour companies offer safaris in parks and reserves that include eco-friendly trips, mountain biking, horseback riding and traditional housing stays. One of the best known parks is Majete Wildlife Reserve, which became a target for poaching that continued into the 1990s. By the 2000s, thanks to a partnership between the government and a non-profit organization, the park was repopulated and rehabilitated. The Big Five (elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo) can be viewed here. \"Malawi is not a wildlife destination, it's not Masai Mara, but that's changing,\" says Rob McConaghy of Ulendo, a travel group operating in Malawi. \"Majete National Park is run as a private park and has reintroduced so much game, you can see the Big Five now.\" 5. Easygoing vibe . Malawi is, in large part, a place of peace and quiet, without the traffic jams and hassles of city life. The country is largely rural; only 15.7% of the population live in urban areas. Clear skies and bright stars make it thrilling for star gazers. The trend is toward self-drive holidays -- visitors rent cars and drive themselves through the country. \"As a country, people perceive Malawi being safe, stable and peaceful,\" says McConaghy. \"It gives an impression of a nice, warm friendly country to travel in.\""}]}

The ride stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. And Tom's trepidation is probably understandable \u2013 it is ten-times higher than his usual diving board height. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee. Sophie starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global. Riders are seated upright and whisked to the top of the 335-foot tower before the seat pivots 90 degrees so the guest is looking straight down. The ride then plunges in a six-second free fall. Falcon's Fury stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60 mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. Riders plunge down in a six-second free fall . Tom described the ride as 'awesome'. Jeff Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said: 'It's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster. 'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.' Park officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee, who starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global . Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and even St. Petersburg, some 30 miles away from the top of the ride. Once riders get to the top of the tower, a computer program determines how long it stays at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge. Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds. During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia . Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure. A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas. The park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows. 'Drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld Magazine. Busch Gardens wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows . 'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. 'Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.' There are taller drop towers in the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California has a 400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it's constructed later this year. Both of those are attached to other rides. A famous drop tower is the Big Shot, the ride atop the Stratosphere hotel and casino in Las Vegas that catapults riders 160 feet in the air."}]}

Duran Duran are suing their own fan club for $40,000 (\u00a323,500) over claims the club failed to pay them fees. The band, best known for their 80s hits Hungry Like The Wolf and Girls On Film, have filed a lawsuit against a club based in Glenview, Illinois. The suit, filed at Cook County Circuit Court, says that\u00a0Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc entered into a contract with the band in 2010 agreeing to set up and run a fan club. Duran Duran are suing their own fan club based in Glenview, Illinois, over lack of payments and poor accounting according to court documents . According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the contract stated that the club would sell merchandise and collect membership fees, handing 75 per cent of profits over to the band. Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc were also supposed to keep accurate accounting records and maintain fan club records. The band's lawyers are claiming that the club failed to keep accounts properly and failed to hand over the agreed fees, and are now suing. Duran Duran released their first single, Planet Earth, in 1981 and it went on to reach number 12 in the UK charts. The same year they also released Girls On Film, one of their best-known records, which ended up reaching number five in the top 40 chart. They reached Number One in the UK in 1983 with 'Is There Something I should know' - the song also reach number Four in the U.S. The 80s pop-rock group are best known for songs such as Girls On Film and Hungry Like The Wolf. They are thought to be working on a new album with John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame . The group, which originally consisted of Roger Taylor, Simon le Bon, John Taylor, Andy Taylor and Nick Rhodes, have topped the chart on two occasions, once in 1983 with Is There Something I Should Know, and again in 1984 with The Reflex. Their last album, All You Need Is Now, released on 21 March 2011 was well received critically but failed to live up to the chart-topping sales power of their previous efforts. In a blog post on their official site, the band have confirmed that they are working on a new album which will include guitar work by John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame."}]}

In its latest bout of saber-rattling, North Korea on Friday warned of the possibility of \"strong physical counter-measures\" against South Korea after the United Nations imposed tougher sanctions against the North earlier this week. The threat against South Korea came a day after the North said it would carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The statement Friday from North Korea's Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said it would take action against South Korea if it \"takes a direct part\" in the U.N. sanctions. U.N. Security Council slams North Korea . The South Korean Unification Ministry declined to comment specifically on the new threats from Pyongyang. It reiterated its stance that North Korea should refrain from further provocations. \"Now is a moment when I think all parties in the six-party process, in particular here, North Korea, should turn their attention to how to peacefully and diplomatically address challenges that concern them,\" U.S. envoy Glyn Davies said from Beijing. The two Koreas have technically still been at war since the all-out conflict between them in the 1950s. Smaller scale clashes have occurred since then, most recently in November 2010 when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing several people. South Korea and the United States are often the focus of menacing language from Pyongyang, but the latest U.N. sanctions, a response to a long-range rocket launched last month by the North, appear to have prompted a ratcheting up of the threats. Opinion: For the U.N. and North Korea -- Game on . A displeased Chinese editorial . At the same time, North Korea's strong words and vow to conduct a third nuclear test -- previous ones took place in 2006 and 2009 -- appear to be testing the patience of its main ally, China, which voted in favor of the U.N. sanctions this week. An editorial published Friday in the English-language edition of the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times struck a displeased tone over Pyongyang's comments a day earlier. \"China's role and position are clear when discussing the North Korea issue in the U.N. Security Council,\" the editorial said. \"If North Korea engages in further nuclear tests, China will not hesitate to reduce its assistance to North Korea.\" That prospect carries weight, since North Korea's impoverished economy relies heavily on China to stay afloat. Global Times, whose editorial line often but not always reflects official Chinese policy, made it clear, though, that Beijing isn't about to cut Pyongyang loose. Timeline: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession . \"If the U.S., Japan and South Korea promote extreme U.N. sanctions on North Korea, China will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions,\" the editorial said. Global Times noted that Beijing had put \"a lot of effort into amendments\" to the resolution approved by the Security Council this week. \"It seems that North Korea does not appreciate China's efforts,\" it said. \"It criticized China without explicitly naming it in its statement yesterday.\" The newspaper was referring to a passage in the controversial North Korean statement Thursday that said that \"big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices.\" The Global Times editorial also suggested that North Korea shouldn't rank too highly among China's priorities. \"China hopes for a stable peninsula, but it's not the end of the world if there's trouble there,\" it said, referring to the Korean peninsula that comprises North and South Korea. \"This should be the baseline of China's position.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday had urged North Korea and the West to \"keep calm, remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region.\" How dangerous is North Korea's nuke capability? U.S. concerned but prepared . U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Thursday there are no \"outward indications\" that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test, but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance. \"They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it,\" he said in a Pentagon press conference. \"We are very concerned with North Korea's continuing provocative behavior,\" Panetta said, but he added that the United States is \"fully prepared\" to deal with any provocations.

Authorities didn't divulge details Friday about what led to the charge. But Peterson's lawyer said the \"charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son\" -- explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline \"much like \"he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas.\" Rusty Hardin said \"Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury.\" Rather, Hardin characterized the former NFL MVP as \"a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son.\" Peterson will travel to Houston and will then \"post bond as soon as it can be arranged,\" according to Hardin. \"(Peterson) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing,\" the lawyer said. Hardin claims that his client has \"cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.\" \"Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning,\" the lawyer said. Right after news broke of the indictment, the Vikings released a statement saying they were \"in the process of gathering information regarding the legal situation.\" The team came back a short time later to announce that its offensive catalyst has been deactivated for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. According to Texas law, a person can be convicted of an injury to a child offense if they are proven to have caused bodily or mental injury \"intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence\" or causing such harm by omission. A child, by this definition, must be 14 years old or younger. Peterson's indictment prompted a flurry of reaction on Twitter. Some defended him and criticized authorities for pressing charges, saying that such forms of discipline are common and acceptable. \"Adrian Peterson was indicted in TX for swatting his son with a switch! Who knew that was illegal, cuz my mama would b in jail!\" tweeted comedian D.L. Hughley. Others came down hard on the Vikings star, including one man who was \"sickened.\" \"Anyone who defends this is a coward,\" one person tweeted. 2-year-old son allegedly killed by another man . The alleged criminal offense took place in Montgomery County, which is north of Houston. The 29-year-old Peterson grew up in Palestine, Texas, which is 150 miles north of Houston and 100 miles southeast of Dallas. A running back for the Vikings since 2007, he rushed for 75 yards in his team's season-opening 34-6 rout of the St. Louis Rams. In 2012, he was named the league's most valuable player when he ran for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of the single-season mark, the NFL said. For all his exploits on the field, Peterson has dealt with heartache and headaches. That includes the death of his brother in 2007, a day before he participated in the NFL's skill testing event for potential draft picks. And last year, Peterson's 2-year-old son died after allegedly being abused by another man. Authorities in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, found that child unresponsive, and later determined he'd suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse. Joseph Robert Patterson, the boyfriend of the boy's mother, was arrested and eventually charged with murder. Patterson has denied the charge and said the boy choked on strawberry fruit snacks, the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, reported. News of Peterson's indictment casts another shadow over the NFL, which is reeling from the fallout over then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Ric allegedly punching his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a casino elevator. A New Jersey grand jury indicted Rice for third-degree aggravated assault; he pleaded not guilty and entered a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that could clear him if he successfully completes the requirements.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Imagine this:  You've toiled at a company for years and followed all the rules.  You're productive, diligent, and respected by your peers.  In short, you're a model employee.  But the latest round of raises that have consumed the office leave you thinking that your male colleagues -- despite having the same job title -- make more than you. You begin to suspect you're the victim of gender discrimination.  So, you decide it's time to \"lean in\" and secure the equal pay you deserve -- 77 cents on the dollar, the nation's going rate, just won't cut it. But when you take this information to your boss you're told that the company's pay practices are secret and you can be fired for discussing them. Throughout America, countless women find themselves between a rock and a hard place.   They suspect they're being denied equal pay, but have no way of confirming it.  Or worse, they don't know they're being shortchanged because company policies prevent them from discussing their wages. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to prohibit wage discrimination on the basis of sex and sought to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.  Its purpose was clear: Eliminate the gender wage gap, which hurts women and families.  But 50 years later, pay discrimination is alive and well.   Gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity. It's time for our wages to get out from behind the secrecy paywall. A majority of private sector workplaces in America  prohibit or discourage employees from discussing their wages with co-workers.  As a result, employees who mention what they earn are threatened with retaliation, including harassment, demotion, or termination. Women who believe they're the victims of unequal pay face an impossible choice: Jeopardize their economic livelihood or suffer the indignity and economic consequences of discrimination.  Low-wage women workers -- many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and are seen as replaceable by their employers -- are especially likely to choose silence and live with pay discrimination rather than risk their jobs. Still others will have no clue that they are being paid less. Pay secrecy policies can keep women in the dark for years.  Take Lilly Ledbetter, who worked as a supervisor at a Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, for  nearly two decades without knowing that she had been denied equal pay.  Had it not been for an anonymous note, she would never have learned that she was earning substantially less than her male colleagues.  Pay secrecy facilitated Goodyear's discrimination. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has exacerbated the problem.  For decades, plaintiffs were typically afforded discovery, the opportunity to secure testimony and documents from their employer, before resolution of their claims.  But in two deeply divided decisions, the Supreme Court recently abandoned that practice and now requires plaintiffs to provide more detailed information about the alleged discrimination before discovery. This higher burden is nearly insurmountable for women alleging unequal pay.  Because of pay secrecy, their complaints often begin with a strong hunch that can only be verified through corporate records and sworn statements.  Denying them access to this basic information is tantamount to locking them out of the courthouse. Unsurprisingly, workplaces that have abandoned punitive pay secrecy, like the federal government and many unionized workplaces, have been particularly effective in reducing the gender wage gap.  Female federal workers are paid 89 cents, and unionized female workers 88 cents, for every dollar paid to men. Economists have posited that more transparent workplaces will lead to greater worker satisfaction and productivity, while closed pay practices will lead to lower motivation and mistrust of management.  Permitting workers to discuss their wages would also make managers more accountable. The Paycheck Fairness Act,  reintroduced in Congress, would prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss their wages.  The legislation has been blocked, but if passed, would finally close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act. It would permit workers to compare notes and determine whether they're being paid fairly, without fear of retribution. If the legislation continues to stall, President Obama can and should act.  He can sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to abandon punitive pay secrecy and protect nearly 22% of the American workforce.  Those refusing to comply would lose the government as a client. And let's not let states off the hook.  State laws can provide important protections against employer retaliation.  In August, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law banning retaliation against workers who inquire about salary. New Jersey  joins states like Vermont, Colorado, Michigan and California in outlining explicit protections for workers seeking equal pay. Justice Louis Brandeis famously said the best remedy for social and industrial disease was publicity and sunlight its most effective disinfectant. Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act, pay secrecy still masks discrimination.  There is only one way to fight this darkness: light. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion."}]}

British brand Boots have been accused of ripping off their UK customers as their No7 products can be bought for a fraction of the price in the U.S. Many of the products in the company's popular beauty range costs \u00a310 less from the U.S. store Walgreens than is charged by Boots in their UK stores and online. For example, the No7 Lift & Luminate Day Cream costs \u00a323 from Boots while from Walgreens, it is available for $20.99 (\u00a312.47). Scroll down for video . Ugly truth: Boots anti-ageing products are cheaper in the U.S . Meanwhile, the Boots No7 Protect & Perfect Intense Serum is \u00a324.95 from Boots but $24.99 from Walgreens (\u00a314.85). Boots was founded in the UK when John Boot opened his first store in 1849 in Nottingham selling herbal remedies. It opened its 1,000th  store in 1933 followed by . the No7 cosmetics range two years later. Over . the decades, Boots have remained a trusted and popular store on the British . High Street - there are now 1,112 health and beauty stores nationwide . and 65 flagship stores and its headquarters remain in Nottingham. Its . modern range of No7 anti-ageing skincare has won awards and is in . demand following proven results in consumer testing and clinical trials. But one British beauty blogger said . 'it's a kick in the teeth' that products from such a historic British . brand are more expensive for UK consumers. Charlie Lankston, who writes the blog Small Fish Big Pond, . said: 'This drives me mad! It's the case with so many beauty products . and brands unfortunately; I went to New York recently and went on . something of a large beauty spree. Part of this was because I was so . eager to pick up products that aren't yet available here but a lot of it . was to do with the fact that everything was so much cheaper over there. Price difference: The No7 serum is \u00a324.95 online and in UK stores, left, while at Walgreens it's $24.99 (\u00a314.85) Saving: The No7 Day Cream is \u00a323 in the UK, left, and \u00a310 cheaper at Walgreens at $20.99 . 'U.S. drugstores have brilliant deals that mean you can pick up products for a fraction of the price that you can here. 'Needless to say it can make you feel a bit frustrated at times and when a British brand seems to favour its American consumers over beauty lovers from its home nation, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth.' Hayley Carr, who writes the beauty blog London Beauty Queen, agreed. She told the MailOnline: 'I'm incredibly disappointed to learn that a British brand with so much history is offering their products at much cheaper prices outside the UK. I've come to believe that because Boots develop and retail all their own products that they're offered at the most affordable price point, cutting out the usual margins that retailers take. 'However, this has fundamentally lead me to question the brand's ethos and pricing structure - there's such a massive difference in price from the UK to the U.S. that it makes you wonder how this is even possible? Or why they're willing to offer their products at a much cheaper price point, which will no doubt have a negative impact on their brands perception and position in the long-term. 'It appears that British consumers are getting a hard deal, when we've been the ones supporting No7 from its inception. Bad form Boots.' Home grown: Founded in Nottingham, Boots have been a presence on the British High Street for more than a century . Meanwhile, Lauren John, who writes the lifestyle blog These City Days, said: 'I always expect price variations with currency changes and so on, but for a brand that in my eyes doesn't do a whole lot throughout the year through offers and promotions on their products, it's a bit disappointing that UK customers don't benefit from savings, even occasional ones, especially from leading products like their serums.' A Boots UK spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'At Boots UK we know our customers want the best quality products at affordable prices. Which is why we offer our UK customers great value in lots of ways that we know you really appreciate. 'We offer benefits through our Boots Advantage Card, which gives you 4 points for every \u00a31 you spend, as well as\u00a0 regular promotions, including 3 for 2 across lots of your favourite products and customised coupons, throughout the year. You can visit boots.com to find out our latest prices and offers.' Walgreens . bought a 45 per cent stake in Boots the Chemist owner Alliance Boots for . 6.7 billion dollars (\u00a34 billion) in 2012 and it was announced . today that they will form a partnership with the U.S. retailer under the company . name Walgreens Boots Alliance. Despite the partnership, the Boots headquarters will remain in Nottingham. Bargains: Dozens of beauty products are cheaper in Walgreens stores than in the UK . Boots aren't the only company who are charging more for their beauty products in the UK. Brands such as Maybelline and L'Oreal can be bought for less on the otherside of the Atlantic. And it's not just on beauty products that Brits are getting a bad deal. Yesterday, the Daily Mail reported how Swedish company Ikea are charging British buyers more than consumers in the U.S. and Europe for its products. And last month it emerged that British shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for TVs, computers and tablets compared to U.S. consumers.

He's already modelled a so-called Crown Collection, launched in time for Prince George's first birthday on July 22, and will be seen in new ranges in the coming months. Can you tell the difference between little Freddie (left) and Prince George? The toddler was put forward by his mother Carly after family friends remarked on his uncanny resemblance to the royal Prince during the Cambridge's recent trip to Australia. As well as looking like George, Freddie seems to share some of his characteristics. He's a happy and laid back, loves being outside, adores animals - especially his pet dog Minnie - and is now starting to move around without too much help from mum and dad. But the similarities between the Royal family and the Minnis family don't end there. Carly and her husband Ross got engaged the same year as William and Kate, tied the knot five months after the couple and Freddie was born just four days before Prince George. Mother Carly pictured with little Freddie at a party - the little tot has since won a lookalike contest . Carly said: 'I've always been a fan of the Royals and the similarities between my family and the Cambridge's is strange. 'I never noticed Freddie's resemblance to Prince George until I saw all the TV coverage during their recent visit to Australia and New Zealand. George was dressed in clothes similar to those Freddie wears and they seem to have the same temperament. 'Like George, Freddie moves around by himself although he's skipped the crawling and has gone straight to trying to walk, and just like the Prince, if he isn't doing what he wants, has a very cute pouty, sulky face. 'He's also obsessed by our family dog Minnie, just like George appears to be with Lupo. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George in New Zealand .

Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama is naive when it comes to Russia and has shown 'faulty judgment' \u2018Had we communicated those things, there's always the potential that we could have kept them from invading a country and annexing it into their own,\u2019 Romney said on CBS' Face the Nation.

He said the U.S. should now welcome nations that seek entry into NATO, should forgo cuts to the U.S. military budget and reconsider putting a missile defense system into the Czech Republic and Poland, as once planned. During the 2012 campaign, Romney had tried to portray the Democratic incumbent as soft on Russia.

Lord Tebbit suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular . People use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, Lord Tebbit claimed yesterday. The former Cabinet minister said there was a \u2018near infinite demand\u2019 for anything free. The Tory peer was speaking in a House of Lords debate about food banks \u2013 which Labour claim are booming because Coalition austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet. But Lord Tebbit suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food. It follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years \u2013 as the number of food banks has risen. The peer said: \u2018There is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free. \u2018One can even notice it in the catering departments of this building. If food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used.\u2019 He invited environment minister Lord de Mauley to \u2018initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where\u00a0 people are living for their basic food on the food banks\u2019. The minister declined. Earlier this month Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand. \u2018Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,\u2019 he added. \u2018However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.\u2019 The intervention came after a series of peers in the House of Lords had called on the Government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the UK. Lord Palmer, an independent crossbench peer, said it was a \u2018scandal in today\u2019s society that food banks have to exist at all\u2019. Labour peers\u2019 leader Baroness Royall . of Blaisdon said food banks in the South West gave aid to more than . 40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year. She . described it as down to \u2018desperate pressing demand due to a cost of . living crisis\u2019 and called for Lord de Mauley to visit one. Lord de Mauley said he had visited a food bank and they were run by \u2018wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk\u2019. The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need . \u2018They perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level,\u2019 he said. \u2018Britain has a great tradition of charitable giving and I think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that.\u2019 Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 . Last . year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he . claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks . because of their own \u2018decisions\u2019. He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.He added: \u2018I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. \u2018Those . pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which . mean they are not best able to manage their finances. \u2018We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.\u2019 A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found. Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 \u2013 before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power. The study, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry. The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them. It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of \u00a33million to the taxpayer. While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food."}]}

A type of mineral 1.2 miles (2km) up the side of the canyon wall suggests that a huge glacier once passed through. While the idea of a glacier is controversial, the scientists say such a theory is the best explanation for their latest findings. Research led by Dr Selby Cull from Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia suggests that part of Valles Marineris may have played host to an ancient glacier. Evidence comes from a mineral called jarosite found half way up the cliff wall (shown), which may have been the top of an ancient glacier that has long since disappeared . The research was led by Dr Selby Cull from the Department of Geology at Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. Evidence for the glacier comes in the form of the mineral jarosite being spotted in the wall, a sulphate that forms in highly acidic water with low temperatures - such as the top of a glacier on Mars. While evidence for glaciers on Mars has been spotted before, this is one of the first times evidence for one has been found in Valles Marineris. Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system. At more than 2,500 miles (4,000 km) long, 120 miles (200 km) wide and up to x miles (7 km) deep it is among the largest canyon in the solar system. It is located on the Martian equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet\u2019s circumference. If it was located on Earth it would stretch across the entire US. One of its largest sections is the Ius Chasma, which is about 938km long, in which this latest discovery was made. Several theories for its formation have been proposed, including water erosion and a tectonic \u2018crack\u2019 in the Martian crust. The canyon itself is thought to have been formed by tectonic stresses, but Dr Cull tells MailOnline the best explanation for the discovery of jarosite here is that a glacier once filled half the canyon. The jarosite was found in a thin layer 330ft (100 metres) along part of the cliff wall, suggesting it was once the boundary of the top of an ancient glacier. \u2018The canyon wall starts at about zero metres elevation and descends to about -4,000 metres [2.5 miles],\u2019 she explains. \u2018We see the jarosite at -1,900 to -2,000 metres [1.18 to 1.24 miles], so about half-way down the canyon wall.\u2019 She continued: \u2018We found [jarosite] in a few places on Mars before, but the exciting thing here is we found it half way up a 3-mile [4.8km] high cliff face in the North Marineris. \u2018All previous jarosite deposits have been found in low-lying deposit areas, places where water would cool.\u2019 Jarosite usually forms in wet and acidic locations like rivers and groundwater, but Dr Cull explains that couldn\u2019t have happened here. 'It would have required half the valley to be filled with water, which would have left huge indicators and evidence that there had been water there, and there\u2019s no evidence,' she says. \u2018So we think the only viable way you see jarosite is if there was a glacier.\u2019 If true, this would be among the first mineralogical evidence for glaciers in the Ius Chasma - one of the largest portions of Valles Marineris. The mineral known as jarosite must have been desposited by highly acidic water at low temperature - and a glacier is the best explanation. Dr Cull says it could not have been a regular water flow such as a river as it would have had to fill half the deep canyon (Ius Chasma shown in image) The discovery was made using instruments on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (left) and Esa's Mars Express (right) spacecraft. Further observations in future will be used to verify the findings . On average, Mars lies 141.6 million miles (227.9 million km) from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles (6,795km), it\u2019s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -65\u00b0C (-85\u00b0F). The gravity there is much weaker than on Earth - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is also desperately thin - one per cent of Earth\u2019s pressure - and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system\u2019s biggest mountain \u2013 Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. This measures 335 miles (540 km) across and rises to a height of 88,000ft (26,800 metres), which is almost three times higher than Everest. Mars has two natural satellites - the moons Deimos and Phobos. The planet's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, the resulting liquid would cover the whole planet in water 36ft (11 metres) deep, according to Nasa. The team used data from two spacecraft, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Esa's Mars Express, to make the findings. Dr Cull admits the theory that this canyon played host to a glacier remains controversial in the scientific community. But she says other explanations for this feature just don\u2019t make sense. One possibility was that this jarosite came from a water table but, as it is not near the surface, Dr Cull says this would require the water table to be slanted, \u2018which is a very strange thing for a water table to do.\u2019 She continues: \u2018If it was a glacier, it would be the top point of the glacier.' The mineral jarosite would form at the top of the glacier, where the ice melts, and be deposited on the cliff wall. One other theory is that this jarosite was deposited by an acid fog. Acid fog is essentially water vapour that is highly enriched in sulphur, which can be released during volcanic emissions. However, with no volcanic vents nearby, this theory looks unlikely. \u2018We are continuing to map Ius Chasma, and will map the surrounding wall surfaces to see if we can find this same mineral elsewhere,\u2019 Dr Cull adds. \u2018It\u2019s very exciting.\u2019 Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system. It is located on the Martian equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet\u2019s circumference. This image of Valles Marineris was taken by Nasa's Viking orbiter in June 1992 ."}]}

Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was found guilty in June of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in southern Cairo to serve his life sentence. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. He attended his trial later that year on a gurney. In December, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported."}]}

But that doesn't make it one of the friendliest. We have committed the cardinal subway sin: not 'validating' our tickets (by inserting them into a stamping machine on the platform). The punishment? An 8,000 Forints (\u00a320) fine. Budapest can only get better. Thankfully it does. A Danube delight: Budapest sits prettily on the banks of western Europe's longest river . The Hungarian capital - which divides into the hilly Buda on the Danube's western bank and the flatter, more commercial Pest on the eastern bank - has plenty of architectural splendours and cultural treasures, plus indulgent food and a lively nightlife. The city's cheap prices - around \u00a32 for a pint - attract stag do parties, but fortunately the local bars don't seem to specifically target these groups. We decide to see the main sights by bike and join a cycling tour run by Budapest Bike Breeze called Wheels And Meals. Moments after meeting - and with barely a glance each way - our energetic guide, Adam, leads us full pelt into Budapest's busiest square - Erzsebet Ter. We race around central Pest, stopping every five minutes for Adam to divulge titbits. For example, the Opera House is reminiscent of the Vienna State Opera (though smaller, so as not to outshine the seat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the magnificent Neo-Gothic Parliament was inspired by Westminster. Now confident whizzing two-wheeled through the city, we speed along the riverfront. Scenes of Hungarian life: Local men focus on the serious pursuit of chess (and try desperately not to drop any pieces) at Budapest's Szechenyi Baths (left); St Stephen's Basilica, on the Pest side of the river (right) The sun is glistening on the Danube, cruise boats are pootling past... when I suddenly fly off my bike and crash to the ground. My boyfriend had somehow managed to wedge his handlebars under mine, thus careering me into the kerb. More embarrassed than injured, we cross the river to the medieval town of Buda, a Unesco World heritage site. Behind the fairytale-like Matthias Church - used as a cattle shed by the invading Turks - is Fisherman's Bastion, whose turrets provide the best views of Pest (and one of the settings for Lord Of The Rings). After a big bowl of goulash soup at the charmingly low-key Drum Cafe, we are back in our saddles. The final hours of our tour take in the wide boulevards of Varosliget district, Heroes' Square and the bizarre Vajdahunyad castle - with its mix of Baroque, Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque styles. A scene from a different era: The city's famous Hotel Astoria Cafe looks like a refugee from another century . Afterwards, we collapse into leather armchairs for coffee and cakes at the city's legendary Gerbeaud Cukraszda caf\u00e9. Hungarians have a reputation for being stand-offish, but with a little persistence, seemingly frosty locals quickly warm up and keenly offer recommendations about their city. Understandably, however, they don't readily discuss life under communist rule. And you will need plenty of energy to tackle the House Of Terror - a museum which commemorates victims of that communist dictatorship, and those of the preceding Nazi years. With all of the explanatory text on the walls in Hungarian, an English audio guide is crucial. Twenty-five minutes' drive away lies another reminder of Hungary's soviet history: Memento Park, the unusual home for a collection of redundant communist statues, which were torn down after the regime collapsed in 1989. Looking from the past to the future: The historic Buda district of the city gazes across at more modern Pest . Here, avoid a guide and do your own background reading instead. The only guide on offer was softly spoken with a thick Hungarian accent and had an infuriating habit of talking as she walked away from the group towards the next statue. Combined with the noisy gravel crunching under 20 tourists' feet and endless overhead planes, the tour was virtually inaudible. More subtle reminders of the nation's difficult history are the abandoned Stock Exchange and National Ballet buildings, plus other crumbling structures now reincarnated as sprawling bars known as 'ruin pubs'. At the end of a frantic weekend, we forgo these watering holes, instead treating ourselves to a soak in the 21 different pools at the Szechenyi Turkish baths.

A mother-of-three has claimed that fathers are as 'useful as t*ts on a bull' following the arrival of a baby because newborns 'don't want dad'. Milli Hill, 40, from Somerset, has stirred up controversy with her comments - written in a column for Best Daily - in response to the news Labour plan to extend paternity leave to four weeks. She writes: 'This time of nurturing a tiny life is mainly (not 'just', but 'mainly'), for mums, and dads who have visions of bonding in this time are likely to end up feeling disappointed, left out and about as useful as t*ts on a bull.' She added: 'Whilst a woman can perform brain surgery or lead a multi-national, I'm afraid to break it to you that there is something a man can't do \u2013 and that's be a mother. 'As I discovered when I realised that my breast-pump was the worst twenty quid I ever spent: no matter what technology you employ or how good your intent, to a baby this is meaningless. 'A small breastfed baby doesn't want a plastic teat and quite often, they don't want dad either. They just want you. 'More time for dads in the early weeks will be largely wasted, because, no matter what breast-pump manufacturers or Westminster policy makers might try to tell you, the so-called \"Paternity Month\" is actually a \"Babymoon\", an epic and life-changing love-in, and it belongs uniquely to mother and child.' Milli's comments sparked a furious reaction on Twitter as parents responded to her views. BeautifulBairns tweeted that Milli was 'utterly wrong' and Phyllida Warmington pointed out: 'I do think a dads presence in the early days in invaluable for practical/emotional support for the mother.' Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, pictured, thinks fathers can play an important role in their child's first days . Katherine Woodbury tweeted: 'My husband and I would have done ANYTHING for more time together. Not all births/PN are straightforward.' Jonathan, 39, a father-of-two, from Hertfordshire, said he was outraged by Milli's comments. He told MailOnline: 'She's made me angry as she generalises and assumes the early days of having a baby are the same for all parents. In fact, childbirth and the days that follow are a unique experience and different for everyone.' Jonathan said that Milli fails to consider how mothers may need the support of their partner if they are recovering from a caesarean section, have other children to attend to, or are simply overwhelmed by becoming a new mother. His own wife had C-sections to deliver both their children and he said she needed him more than ever afterwards. He said she would have struggled if he had not been able to take an extra week holiday following his two-week paternity leave. Fathers argued that they can still bond with their babies with skin-on-skin contact (photo posed by models) Milli's article prompted reaction on social media including this tweet from Katherine Woodbury, left, who said mothers need their partner if a birth was not straightforward, and 'King Of Dads said they were irked, right . He said: 'Particularly after our second child was born, I was needed at home to help look after our two-year-old. 'I wanted to be there to get to know my children and to support my wife, even if that just meant making her a cup of tea.' He added he could bond with his newborns by skin-on-skin contact even if he couldn't feed them. Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, who runs the website\u00a0diaryofthedad.co.uk, agrees. He said: 'I'd say that it's essential that dads are around from birth - although there are things that we obviously can't do, such as breastfeeding, there's lots that we can do to support our partners and, just as importantly, bond with our children. 'If you take into consideration the fact that we're already at a disadvantage due to biological reasons, it's even more important that we're about in the first few weeks to bond with them and I don't think she has considered dads' feelings. 'The first few weeks of being a parent is certainly not something that's exclusive to mother and child. Parenting is a shared privilege and responsibility from the word go.' Speaking to MailOnline today, Milli said she was sorry if her article had offended parents. She said: 'I'm aware that the article has sparked controversy and I am extremely sorry if I have offended fathers - this was not my intention. 'I do wish I had written more about the importance of fathers but the focus of my article was motherhood and the point I wished to make was that, in particular in the early weeks, there is a mother-baby relationship underway which is very intense and special. Milli believes the most important person to a newborn is their mother and the 'babymoon' belongs uniquely to them, meaning fathers can feel left out (file photo) 'Fathers can of course - and do - support mums by taking care of the house, shopping etc and this is fantastic. But the fundamental bonding time that is taking place is largely between mum and baby and I don't think we should be afraid of saying this. 'I think that it would be great if dads could have more flexible time off after birth - I understand in Australia for example they can take the paternity leave at any time in the first year which makes a lot more sense. 'I'm just not convinced that, if we are saying that dads can only have four weeks off, that weeks two to four are the best time for them to take this leave.' Acknowledging Jonathan's point that mothers may need extra support after a caesarean birth or if they are struggling with post natal depression, or feeling overwhelmed, she said: 'Mothers are still going to struggle if dad has four weeks off and then returns to work. 'What is needed for these women - and ALL women - is better support: better preparation for motherhood, better birth experiences, better follow-up from midwives (and this means more midwives) and better support networks around them.' Fathers are especially needed when a couple has more than one child following a new arrival (file photo) Milli wrote her thought-provoking piece in response to\u00a0Labour leader Ed Miliband's announcement that his party would increase paternity pay to \u00a3260-a-week, the equivalent of the minimum wage, so more working fathers can afford to take time off. The father-of-two believes more dads want to play a hands-on role in childcare but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'. Jonathan admits he would have been unlikely to take four weeks paternity leave had it been available when his children were born because it would have meant they had less money coming in. But he thinks it's important fathers have the option. 'The choice should be there. Fathers spending more time with their children can only be a good thing,' he said. 'Many fathers won't take a month off because of finances and the pressure from colleagues to return to work. We need a cultural change so a father taking a month off after his child is born isn't unusual.'"}]}

Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov now plays for AS Monaco and scored the second goal in the French Ligue 1 side's shock 3-1 win in the last 16, first leg tie Wednesday. On a night of upsets, Hakan Calhanoglu's sublime second half strike gave Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 home leg win over last season's finalists Atletico Madrid. Spanish title holder Atletico also had Tiago sent off for a second yellow card late in the game and saw an equalizing effort from substitute Fernando Torres chalked off because it was ruled the ball had gone out of play before he scored. Tiago had been denied by home keeper Bernd Leno in the best chance of the match for the visitors. Its coach Diego Simeone summed up the match but still believes his team has a fighting chance of progressing. \"We each had a clear chance, they took theirs and we didn't. It could have been a worse result,\" he said. English Premier League Arsenal was a strong favorite to progress when the draw for the knockout stage was made, but Monaco absorbed early pressure before going ahead just before halftime from a counterattack. Joao Moutinho found Geoffrey Kondogbia, whose fierce shot took a slight deflection off Per Mertesacker and flew past David Ospina in the Gunners goal. German international Mertesacker was at fault for the second just after the break as he was caught out of position and allowed  Anthony Martial to find Berbatov. The striker, who played for Manchester United and Fulham after leaving Tottenham, controlled the pass instantly before firing an unstoppable shot high into the net. Trailing 2-0 Arsenal desperately sought a reply and both Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck were guilty of glaring misses in front of goal. Monaco also remained a threat on the break and Berbatov and the excellent Moutinho combined to set up Martial for a chance which Ospina blocked. Arsenal was given late hope when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in injury time with a curling strike from just outside the penalty area. But its chances of going through took a nosedive when Oxlade-Chamberlain turned from hero to culprit when he lost the ball on the halfway line. Winger Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, who had come on as a late substitute for Berbatov, raced clear and scored with an emphatic strike. It left it a desperately disappointing night for Arsenal and its manager Arsene Wenger, who forged his reputation as manager of Monaco before coming to the English Premier League. And prospects for the second leg scarcely look any better, with Monaco having an excellent defensive record in the Champions League and holding three away goals. \"We are confident in our ability and we deserved to win,\" Berbatov told Sky Sports. \"We wanted to win more than them and were fighting all over the pitch,\" added the 34-year-old veteran. Wenger admitted that his team face an uphill battle to reach the quarterfinals with the handicap of a two-goal deficit. \"The task is massive now, the third goal makes it even more difficult but we will have a go.\""}]}

Sentencing is scheduled for July 8. \"We're going to appeal,\" Littlejohn's lawyer, Joyce David, told CNN after the conviction. \"We're disappointed.

Before the verdict, David stressed to CNN that she believed in the innocence of her client, saying that Littlejohn was framed and that another person was a likely suspect. \"He was a convenient scapegoat who has a long criminal record,\" David said.

He might have a farmer for a father but Prince Harry looked slightly ill at ease when confronted with an enormous bull during a visit to the Suffolk County Show in Ipswich this afternoon. Nothing daunted, the royal carried on chatting to its owner - even when the Red Poll began to beadily roll its eyes. Luckily for Harry, the rest of the animals at the showground proved less intimidating, with the prince even crouching down for a cuddle with one calf. Afterwards, the prince was taken to meet a flock of prize-winning sheep and this time, eagerly squatted down for a closer look. Then, after a chat with the animal's excited young owner, Harry beamed as he posed for a photo with the junior shepherd. Scroll down for video . Fright night: Prince Harry maintains a safe distance from the beady-looking Red Poll bull while he chats to its owner during a visit to the Suffolk Show . Hello there: The two bulls were kept on a tight leash by their owners who had gathered in the parade ring ahead of their visit from the prince . No touching! This smaller bull seemed less than impressed to meet Prince Harry and even frothed at the mouth as the royal visitor approached . Much better! An adorable calf found more favour with the prince, who crouched down to say hello - much to the delight of its handlers . During his tour of the show, which also received a royal visit from his mother Princess Diana in 1986, the prince was also introduced to a Suffolk Punch horse, a traditional breed of heavy horse that is now considered endangered. After giving the animal a friendly pat, the prince met troops from his former base at Wattisham Flying Station . before completing his whistle-stop tour of Suffolk by enjoying a parade of Royal British Legion standards through the showground.

Grinning from between the goal posts, the prince took his goal-keeping duties seriously, ensuring that not one of the children lined up against him managed to score their penalty. Despite his antics, nothing could dampen the children's enthusiasm, with his pint-sized opponents describing the royal visitor as a 'funny' chap who 'kept making lots of jokes'. Harry, who . is fresh from a successful three-day tour of Estonia and Italy, . impressed local children with his talent for touch rugby and even took . part in a game of football, although soon found himself on the receiving . end of a powerful tackle. 'He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back,' revealed nine-year-old Aryon Tandel, from Ipswich. 'He was taking it quite seriously.' So that's how it's done!

Prince Harry uses his body to block the pint-sized goal during a penalty shootout in which not one got past him . Limbering up: The prince prepares for the first penalty while taking part in a shoot out during a visit to a coaching session for children near Ipswich in Suffolk . Not getting past me! The prince concentrates intently as a ball booted by one of the young players comes whizzing towards his nose . Got it! Prince Harry stretches out a long leg and hooks the incoming ball away from his goal, knocking it safely into a far flung corner of the field . Ducking and diving: Prince Harry seemed to be enjoying himself during his stint in goal - during which not one ball slipped past him . Another young fan, Brandon Norman, eight, from Ipswich, managed to score a goal against Harry's team - much to his delight. 'He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,' said the delighted boy. The prince - who met the children during a . visit to Inspire Suffolk, a community project in Ipswich - is the vice patron . of the Rugby Football Union, and also took part in a game of rugby - which he took just as seriously as he did the football. 'He was funny and making lots of jokes,' revealed one nine-year-old opponent, George Hill from Ipswich. 'He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in . front again he would slap me!' Equally . impressed was 11-year-old Jake Katz Roberts from Islington in north . London, who was one of the few who managed to evade one of the prince's . lunging tackles. 'He told me: \"That's the last time you're going to skin me,\" revealed the young rugby player, adding: 'Harry was really fun and got stuck in.' Near miss: The royal flinches as a flying ball comes flying straight towards his head but (right) ends up sighing with relief after catching the ball . Nervous? Harry looked anxious as he took the position of Goalkeeper . Well played! Prince Harry gives one of the little boys taking part a high five but ends up on the receiving end of a strong challenge from another . Right, we'll do it like this!

And while the disease typically dies on surfaces within hours, research has discovered it can survive for more than seven weeks under certain conditions. During tests, the UK\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) found that the Zaire strain will live on samples stored on glass at low temperatures for as long as 50 days. The left-hand charts plot survival rates of Zaire strain of Ebola (Zebov) and Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv) on glass (a) and plastic (b) at 4\u00b0 (39\u00b0F) over 14 days. The right-hand charts reveal the survival rate under the same conditions over 50 days. Both viruses survived for 26 days, and Ebola was extracted after 50 days . The tests were initially carried out by researchers from DSTL\u00a0before the current outbreak, in 2010, but the strain investigated is one of five that is still infecting people globally. The findings are also quoted in advice from the Public Agency of Health in Canada. Ebola was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) - the most recent species, discovered in 2008. For their 2010 paper, \u2018The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol\u2019, the UK\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)  tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov). Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4\u00b0 (39\u00b0F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. For their 2010 paper, \u2018The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol\u2019, Sophie Smither and her colleagues tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zebov. Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids, and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4\u00b0 (39\u00b0F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. \u2018This study has demonstrated that \ufb01loviruses are able to survive and remain infectious, for extended periods when suspended within liquid and dried onto surfaces,\u2019 explained the researchers. \u2018Data from this study extend the knowledge on the survival of filoviruses under different conditions and provide a basis with which to inform risk assessments and manage exposure.\u2019 The researchers do stress that these tests were carried out in a controlled lab environment, and not in the real world, but published their findings to highlight the survival rates. Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its Ebola guidelines following the rise in infections. Ebola (pictured) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) The centre explained that Ebola is not spread through the air, water, or food and a person infected with Ebola can\u2019t spread the disease until symptoms appear. The time from exposure to when signs or symptoms of the disease appear, known as the incubation period, is two to 21 days, but the average time is eight to 10 days. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises: . \u2022 DO wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \u2022 Do NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of people who are sick. \u2022 Do NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person\u2019s blood or body fluids, like clothes, bedding, needles,or medical equipment. \u2022 Do NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola. Ebola is spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through\u00a0eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. Signs of Ebola include fever and symptoms like severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising. Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: \u2018The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. 'They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.\u2019 Officials have emphasised there is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not yet showing symptoms. But, specialists at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta found that the virus is present on a patient\u2019s skin after symptoms develop, underlining how contagious the disease is once symptoms set in. According to the CDC, the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops and can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid. However, bleach solutions, including household bleach, can kill it. Ebola is only spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. It can be killed using bleach . There is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola, but experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development. The CDC advises people wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, to protect themselves. It warns to not touch the blood or body fluids, including urine, faeces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen of people who are sick. Ebola was once thought to originated in gorillas, because human outbreaks began after people ate gorilla meat. But scientists now believe that bats are the natural reservoir for the virus, and that apes and humans catch it from eating food that bats have drooled or defecated on, or by coming in contact with surfaces covered in infected bat droppings and then touching their eyes or mouths. The current outbreak seems to have started in a village near Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, where bat hunting is common, according to Doctors Without Borders.

(AP Photo/Ron Edmonds, File) First trip: President Barack Obama is seen here with Prince Charles, center, and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, right, at the 65 anniversary D-Day celebration in 2009 . France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (second from left) speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama, as they walk in front of Britain's Prince Charles (left), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (third from left) and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (second from right) at Colleville-sur-Mer cemetery  before a ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2009 . Before him, presidents acknowledged the D-Day invasion with words or statements, but none made a pilgrimage to the site, not even Dwight Eisenhower, who had been the Supreme Allied Commander who ordered the invasion. Here is a sampling of how presidents observed the key D-Day anniversaries. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, 10th anniversary, 1954 . Issued a statement that reflected the Cold War chasm of the day: 'We see peoples, once bitter enemies, burying their antagonisms and joining together to meet the problems of the postwar world. If all those nations which were members of the Grand Alliance have not maintained in time of peace the spirit of that wartime union, if some of the peoples who were our comrades-in-arms have been kept apart from us, that is cause for profound regret, but not for despair.' Eisenhower did go to Normandy after his presidency, for the 20th anniversary observance. Former President Bill Clinton was in Normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of France . Former President George W. Bush, whose father is a World War II hero, went to Normandy for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 . LYNDON JOHNSON, 20th anniversary, 1964 . Johnson, in Washington pushing for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, delivered remarks to members of a D-Day delegation, headed by Gen. Omar Bradley: 'Your country remembers and will never forget, the resolve born on that D-Day, that, so long as we are able, and other men are willing to stand together, we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again. ... So let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried, nor the cause for which our sons died. Where we have commitments to the cause of freedom, we shall honor them \u2014 today, tomorrow and always.' RICHARD NIXON, 30th anniversary, 1974 . Nixon, in the throes of the Watergate investigation and with impeachment hearings underway, sent General Bradley once again to the ceremonies. Five years earlier, Nixon had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the Normandy assault 'a historical landmark in the history of freedom.' He also met at the White House with former war correspondents who were on their way to France for the 25th anniversary observance. Preparations and atmosphere for the Normandy D-Day landings 70th anniversary are seen in Arromanches Le Bain, France . 91-year-old U.S. veteran Edward Tierney from Brock Berry, Connecticut, who landed on June 14, 1944 is seen here signing an autograph for two young reenactors . RONALD REAGAN, 40TH anniversary, 1984 . Reagan spoke at the top of the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, the Atlantic Ocean spread behind him and with 62 gray-haired surviving Rangers seated before him. 'They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms. 'Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.' BILL CLINTON, 50th anniversary, 1994 . Clinton attended the 50th anniversary, delivering his remarks at the U.S. Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. His comments offer an ironic reference point to the Europe that Obama faces as he arrives in Normandy on Friday. 'Fifty years later, what a different world we live in. Germany, Japan and Italy, liberated by our victory, now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom. Russia, decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war, has been reborn in democracy. 'And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev, the liberation of this continent is nearly complete. Now the question falls to our generation: How will we build upon the sacrifice of D-Day's heroes? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We cannot stay safe by doing so. Avoiding today's problems would be our own generation's appeasements. For just as freedom has a price, it also has a purpose, and its name is progress.' American veteran Frederick Carrier reads the names of soldiers who died landing on Utah Beach at Saint Marie du Mont . GEORGE W. BUSH, 60th anniversary, 2004 . Bush went to Normandy in 2002 to observe Memorial Day. He returned for the 60th anniversary, speaking at the U.S. cemetery and accompanied by French President Jacques Chirac. 'All who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of America. We pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of God's mercy. And we still look with pride on the men of D-Day, on those who served and went on. It is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of America to cross an ocean and throw back the marching, mechanized evils of fascism.' BARACK OBAMA, 65th anniversary, 2009 . Obama recalled that his grandfather, a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the English Channel, crossed the channel six weeks after D-Day and followed allied forces across France. 'At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. ... That is the story of Normandy \u2014 but also the story of America; of the Minutemen who gathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge at Gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.'"}]}

And in theory, any carbon-based liquid fuel could be engineered from the process. The team said its immediate challenge is to increase the bionic leaf's ability to turn solar energy to biomass by optimising the catalyst and the bacteria. Their goal is 5 per cent efficiency, compared to nature's rate of 1 per cent efficiency for photosynthesis to turn sunlight into biomass. \u2018We're almost at a 1 per cent efficiency rate of converting sunlight into isopropanol,\u2019 Professor Nocera said. \u2018There have been 2.6 billion years of evolution, and [Professor Silver] and I working together a year and a half have already achieved the efficiency of photosynthesis.\u2019 The findings are published in the journal PNAS and co-authors include Joseph Torella, and Christopher Gagliardi."}]}

I'm simply not hipster enough to fully appreciate a device that somehow makes it more difficult to write 700 words about not wearing pants. That kind of art requires only the very best modern technology. And a weird childhood. But long-form writing really isn't the point of the Hanx Writer, for it serves a completely different purpose. Digital nostalgia. And it's a hit. As I'm writing this on Thursday night, the Hanx Writer sits proudly as the No. 1 free iPad app in the iTunes store. Behold! The awesome power of Tom Hanks! He managed to take something from your parents' garage, and put it right on your iPad. But what I really find funny is the iTunes category: Productivity. Sorry, Mr. Hanks. I do appreciate the inventiveness of your app and your passion for the medium, however let's not kid ourselves. It's anything but productive. Unless, of course, your goal for the day is to make multiple spelling and punctuation mistakes. In which case, it\" s f&9#ing greatgdzfg!.; . To be fair, it does have a few necessary conveniences, like a setting which allows you to use \"modern delete.\" It also provides for copy-paste. So, it's sort of a combination of old and new. Users can enjoy the feeling of a typewriter while still processing words digitally. The idea is that what you make will feel to you, and look to your reader, like something more personal than an e-mail or a text message. And Hanks argues that kind of personalization shines best through a typewriter. Even a digital one. The Oscar-winning actor is actually a huge aficionado of typewriters. A year ago, he even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about why he loves them so much. Amazingly, Hanks says he uses a manual typewriter almost every day. He wrote: \"Everything you type on a typewriter sounds grand, the words forming in mini-explosions of SHOOK SHOOK SHOOK. A thank-you note resonates with the same heft as a literary masterpiece.\" Maybe so. \"Sarah, thanks for being my beautiful maid of honor on such a special day for me and Brad. I'm sorry you threw up in the hotel lobby.\" And maybe not. Now, for what it's worth, this column was crafted (ha!) over the span of two days using two different computers. During that time, I paused to read more of Hanks' op-ed. And, despite my earlier cynicism, I admit that I now better understand the appeal. Dammit, Tom Hanks. Why do you have to be so charming? So, yeah, I'm sort of sold on the idea that an old typewriter might tap into your creativity in a different way. Which is why they put a lot of thought into making this app. Pulling from Hanks' vast personal collection, the app's developer, Hitcents, created several totally original vintage-style typewriter choices. One of these comes standard with the app. The others are available for purchase. And each types with a completely different style. With the help of Hanks, they literally studied the ink patterns of these old typewriters, and digitally recreated the typefaces within the app. Thus, if you're not working on anything too serious as a final draft, and if you want to explore your creativity and communication in a different, perhaps even more personal, way, the Hanx Writer might just be the app for you. Maybe so. \"Sarah, we just got a bill from the hotel.\" And maybe not. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter. See more content with questionable news value at CNN Comedy."}]}

Youk Chhang runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has documented 20,000 mass graves. He was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power. Separated from his family, forced into slave labor, beaten nearly to death for stealing rice for his pregnant sister, he saw the horrors firsthand. His mother lost a daughter and four siblings; 30 years later she still searches for them, hoping they survived. Chhang survived by eating whatever he could find. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it took him months to walk home to his family. Eventually, he fled to safety in the United States. \"Food was ... more important than God,\" Chhang said. \"I always wish to have a bowl of rice. And one good night's sleep. That's all I wanted. I would do anything for it.\"  Watch Youk Chhang talk about what he ate, how he survived \u00bb . But the ghosts of the genocide brought Chhang back to Cambodia. And for more than a decade, he has run the Documentation Center of Cambodia. \"DC-Cam,\" as it is known, is the world's largest repository of information about the Cambodian genocide. It holds hundreds of thousands of documents, photos and films as well as interviews with both survivors and former Khmer Rouge members. Chhang said he believes the Khmer Rouge kept such careful records as a measure of their success -- a trophy of sorts. \"At each time when they kill a person, they document it so that they can measure their success one step forward,\" Chhang said. \"If they kill two, then two step forward. If they kill five, then five step forward. So to them, it's a golden file. But I mean, to us it's crime against humanity.\" DC-Cam has located and mapped nearly 200 prisons and 20,000 mass graves across the country. For Chhang and DC-Cam, the work is critical to preserving memory and promoting justice.  Watch as Chhang takes CNN's Christiane Amanpour into DC-Cam's secured vault \u00bb . Today in Cambodia, a tribunal is under way to try five of the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- 30 years after their alleged crimes. DC-Cam is providing much of the evidence for use in the trial, evidence that makes plain the facts of the genocide, the scope of the losses and the personal and national grief. Chhang said he hopes the tribunal will help Cambodians move forward -- and help heal the nation he loves. But even now, the way forward is difficult. Chhang has dedicated a lifetime of work, research, preservation and advocacy to his mother, whose bravery and sacrifice inspired him. Even though his mother survived and they shared much of the same pain and many of the same losses, the two do not talk about what happened. Some in Cambodia are anxious to forget and forgive. Others are angry and searching for justice. Many, like Chhang, said that only by knowing, exploring and exposing the truth will Cambodia be able to rectify its past -- and secure a healthy future."}]}

Arriving to the US a young, idealistic student, Lawal has carved a name for himself in one of the most competitive industries in the world: Oil. Now head of a multi-billion dollar empire, his Houston-based company, CAMAC, is one of the largest black-owned businesses in the U.S., generating over $2 billion dollars a year. Founded nearly 25 years ago, Lawal built CAMAC (which stands for Cameroon-American) from a small agriculture business into a global oil company. But it's taken a lot of hard work, determination and guts to get him to the top. Born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1954, Lawal became interested in America and its civil rights movement during his teens. After finally persuading his father, a local politician, to send him to university in America, Lawal headed to Georgia and then Houston, where he attended the Texas Southern University. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering in 1976, Lawal, like many of his classmates, started out as a graduate in the energy industry. First as a chemist for Dresser Industries (now Halliburton) and then as a chemical engineer with Shell Oil Refining Co. During this time he met his wife, Eileen through a mutual friend and had his three children. Now married and settled, it wasn't long before the innovative young Nigerian started to implement his business ideas. In 1986 he established CAMAC, a company trading agricultural commodities such as sugar, tobacco and rice. In the early 90s he made the leap into the energy sector after the Nigerian government started to develop its energy market. With his knowledge of Nigeria and his Houston address, Lawal was ideally positioned to attract major oil companies. In 1991 CAMAC made a deal with the oil giant Conoco, agreeing to jointly operate and share production from any Nigerian discoveries. This turned out to be Lawal's big break. With his political contacts, local market knowledge and now with the backing of a major oil firm, Lawal's Houston-based company became an instant player in the energy industry. As Lawal told CNN: \"That partnership I believe was the cornerstone of the CAMAC that you know today. Subsequently with that credibility and the advantage of partnering with Conoco, we were also able to partner with BP and also with Statoil of Norway and currently we have made a partnership with Eni, the largest Italian company, which is one of the top five oil companies in the world.\" Now CAMAC has offices in London, Johannesburg, Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria and is involved in oil exploration, refining and trading. He was awarded the USAfrica Business Person of the Year in 1997 and in 2002 CAMAC was named the largest African-American owned company on the Black Enterprise 100s list."}]}

The female mind has always been a complete mystery to most men and their enigmatic thoughts and actions almost impossible to decode - until now. Finally the closely-held secret of whether a woman fancies someone has been exposed and experts have found it is all in the eyes. A new study looked at how and where women glance after a man makes initial eye contact and found this shows him all he needs to know about his chances of romance. Great news! Life coach Ali Campbell says that if a woman looks down and sweeps the floor with her eyes, left, or looks to the side and then back it is a sure sign she fancies a man . What happens in the 45 seconds after . meeting makes it crystal clear if love is in the air or whether the . hapless male suitor will get the cold shoulder, experts have said. About turn: A woman looking sideways was often thought to be a rejection but research has found that in fact she is attracted to you . Life coach Ali Campbell says in his book 'More than Just Sex' that the look men want to see is her looking down and then moving her eyes in a sweeping motion across the floor because it almost certainly means that she is attracted to you. This glance means that she is checking her internal emotions, in short, she likes you but is working out how much. 'It's the . holy grail of looks,' he said. 'If a guy can pick up on that he has a sure-fire way to work out if she is interested.' And in a complete reversal the . disinterested, shy or bashful look sideways a woman often gives is not . the brush-off most men thought it was. It is in fact the opposite. If a woman looks away for up to 45 . seconds and then stares you . straight in the eye it is another sure sign that she is interested . because she is thinking hard about whether you are a suitable partner. 'Most guys have the idea that if they make eye contact and she looks away she is not interested. But she will look away, that's inevitable. That's what happens when we think to ourselves and also consider our feelings,' Mr Campbell told MailOnline. 'I have interviewed literally hundreds of women and too many men concentrate on having the right car, the right watch, the right whatever. But it is rubbish, all the women I spoke to told me they are just interested in what men are like inside. 'What I am doing for guys is to make sure they know there is someone out there who is interested in you. The important thing is to show who you really are.' But of course with good news there is . bad and this book has also given men the clearest indications yet about . whether they have no chance of love with someone they like. If . after the man makes eye contact she instantly looks over his head or . stares straight back at him it is almost certainly curtains. Forget it: An aggressive stare, left, or looking up or over a man's head is not good news and experts say a man is best to turn his attention elsewhere . These two 'aggressive' reactions mean the man should back off quickly and turn his attentions elsewhere to avoid further embarrassment. 'You do not want her to stare you out or look over your head. That's a bad sign,' he said. Mr Campbell's study has also found women . give off other signals that men should look out for on a date or when . they meet someone for the first time. Secret: The book has revealed a whole new world to men which they can use to know if a date is going well or not . Whether she is right or left handed she will use her dominant wrist to point at you if she likes you. Also if she touches her hair she is attracted to you and if she twirls the ends then she really likes you."}]}

Woods, fired a four-under par 69 in the final round at the RACV Royal Pines Resort course on Queensland's Gold Coast to finish on 16-under, two shots better that 17-year-old Australian amateur Minjee Lee. \"This is a huge accomplishment for me,\" Woods said afterwards at the event sanctioned by the European and Australian Ladies' Tour. \"All off season I was just getting ready with my coach back home and he told me he thinks that this is my year, my time to finally get a win and to have it this early in the season is exciting, especially with the European Tour and then here in Australia,\" she added. \"I'm just really proud with how I played this week and followed through all four days and finished strong.\" Woods, who turned pro in 2012 and joined the Ladies European Tour last year, had a one-shot lead after 54 holes and got off to the best possible start in the final round opening up with a birdie.

When her eighth-grade children wouldn't stop talking, Ms Baffoni said: 'I feel like stabbing some of these kids - I have a knife here.' The teacher had been warned just a day earlier that her probation period might not be extended at the Collaborative Academy of Science Technology and Language Arts on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and she was fired in June 2012. Exasperation: Jacqueline Baffoni (left) joked she would stab her eight-grade students with a fruit knife . The New York Post reported that Ms Baffoni made the comments during last school year. The incident came just after receiving written notification that the school was considering 'discontinuing' her probation. Another teacher at the school told the Office of the Special Commissioner of Investigation (SCI) that this warning 'might have prompted' Ms Baffoni's outburst. It is as yet unclear why her probation was under threat - Ms Baffoni had been teaching at the school since 2009, but lost her job before the investigation could take place in mid-October last year. A second student told the SCI that the teacher reacted to students' bad behavior by saying: 'I have a knife in this room, and I wish I could stab them!'

During these efforts she spoke proudly of her children, claiming: 'Many teachers may tell this tall tale, but I really do teach the best students in New York City!' Tracy Wu, a former flatmate of Ms Baffoni, who is also a teacher, told the Post that this outburst was most likely due to her friend just venting her exasperation.

'She is incredibly dedicated to her job and to her kids - probably more than she should be,' Wu added.

Arnon Milchan, 68, who's famous for smash hit movies including 'Fight Club' and 'Pretty Woman,' spoke openly for the first time about his espionage work in an Israeli TV special that aired Monday night. The program reveals Milchan, at the special request of his friend Shimon Peres, who is now the country's president' set up and operated some 30 companies in 17 countries that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s. He brokered deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the show. 'I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,' Milchan said of his work for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations. 'Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting.' The film tycoon spoke to Israeli investigative journalist Ilana Dayan for the season premiere of her current affairs show, Uvda.

David Cameron tonight addressed the nation on the big political issue of the day: does he hate Larry the Cat. According to a new book, the claws are out for the pet hired to catch mice in the corridors of power. But in the midst of a growing political storm and a Twitter campaign to \u2019Save Larry\u2019, even the Prime Minister had to resort to a pun, insisting they all get on \u2019purr-fectly well\u2019. Mr Cameron initially ruled out getting a cat to deal with the rat problem in Downing Street. But under pressure from those around him, including his children, he relented in February 2011 and Larry was found at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. A new book lifting the lid on the tensions which dominate the coalition claim it is not just pesky Lib Dems which Mr Cameron is fed up with. Matthew d\u2019Ancona suggests in the book, In It Together, that the Camerons \u2019do not like the Downing Street cat, Larry, amid suggestions that the pet is a PR prop\u2019. As fur flew, the revelation sparked a Twitter storm using the hashtag #savelarry. In an attempt to quell the row, Mr Cameron took to Twitter tonight to insist: \u2019I can set everyone's mind at rest in the #SaveLarry campaign. \u2019He and I get on purr-fectly well. The kids love him too.\u2019 David Cameron took to Twitter in a bid to quell the row over Larry the Cat .

Mr Cameron may have been spooked by comparisons with the Blairs, who famously ousted Downing Street cat Humphrey within weeks of New Labour coming to office, with speculation rife about a rift with Cherie. However concerns about Larry first emerged two years ago. Mr Cameron in particular grew fed up with his suit getting covered in hair, while visitors to the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence were met with the smell of cat food badly disguised by cheap air freshener. However, Larry\u2019s preference for catnapping over rat catching has long been a cause for concern. It took more than a year before he secured his first kill, drawing comparisons with Mr Cameron\u2019s love of \u2019chillaxing\u2019. Mousy: The Camerons were said to be disappointed with Larry's performance as a rat-catcher - the job for which he was intended . David Cameron, pictured arriving at the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, has sought to dispel rumours over Larry's future .

Lamine Diack, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, has called for Russian law to be respected ahead of his sport's world championships, which begin in Moscow on Saturday. Russian President Vladimir Putin last month signed into effect a law which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. \"I don't feel there is a problem whatsoever,\" Diack, a member of the International Olympic Committee, told reporters. \"Russia has their laws. Each athlete can have their own private life, so we won't call upon people about this and that. \"This law has to be respected. We are here for the World Championships and have no problem whatsoever and I'm not worried at all.\" The new laws have led to calls for the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in the city of Sochi, to be taken away from Russia. A 320,000-signature petition protesting the country's stance on gay rights ahead of the Games was presented to Olympic bosses in Switzerland on Wednesday. Responding to the petition, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge reaffirmed the Olympic movement's commitment to freedom of expression. \"The Olympic charter is clear. A sport is a human right and it should be available to all, regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation,\" said Rogge in a statement. \" As far as the freedom of expression is concerned, of course, this is something that is important.\" According to the IOC's statement, the Russian government has confirmed the new legislation will not apply to athletes and tourists during the Games. \"This legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented, particularly as regards the Games in Sochi. \"As a sporting organization, what we can do is to continue to work to ensure that the Games can take place without discrimination against athletes, officials, spectators and the media. \"To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.\" Rogge's words were welcomed by All Out, the gay rights group which delivered the petition to the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. \"This is the strongest and most direct statement we have received from the IOC,\"All Out co-founder and executive director Andre Banks said in a statement. \"It shows the IOC is listening to the global outcry against these laws and demanding real answers, not propaganda, from the Russian government. \"When he mentions the importance of freedom of expression, Rogge is right. Fundamental freedoms are eroded for all Russians -- gay and straight -- under these laws. \"Pierre de Coubertin created the Games with the dream of 'changing the world through sport'. In that spirit, we are calling for the IOC to clearly denounce the anti-gay law and do everything in its power to see that it is removed before the Olympics.\" Russia's sports minister Vitaly Mutko, speaking at the same press conference as Diack, urged journalists to \"calm down\" before defending the new law. \"In addition to this law, we have a constitution that guarantees all rights to private life,\" insisted Mutko. \"This law is not intended to deprive any people of any religion, of any race, of any sexual orientation, but to ban the promotion of non-traditional relations among the younger generations. \"All sports athletes and organizations should be relaxed. All their rights will be protected. \"You have to respect the laws of the country you are coming to. This is a sports festival and we only have to talk about it.\" U.S. President Barack Obama spoke out on the issue on Tuesday's Jay Leno show, condemning the laws as against the spirit of the Olympics. \"I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,\" said Obama. Obama this week canceled a one-on-one meeting with Putin which had been scheduled for September. The reason given by the White House was Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and \"lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control,\" while also mentioning human rights issues. World Sport Presents: An uneven playing field . In June Obama visited Diack's native Senegal, where homosexuality is illegal. Obama called for all African citizens to be treated equally, but Senegal's president Macky Sall insisted the country is \"not ready\" to decriminalize homosexuality. British broadcaster Stephen Fry penned an open letter to his country's prime minister David Cameron, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge and London 2012 chief Sebastian Coe calling for the Games to be taken away from Russia. There has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to Russia for the Games. Protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of Russian vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the Games themselves. However, some gay athletes insist the Games must go ahead in Sochi. \"I'm fully against a boycott,\" New Zealand speed skater Blake Skjellerup told CNN. \"The Olympics have been very important to me and I know that a lot of people like myself have worked very hard for these Games. \"It's very important for the world to show up in Sochi and be united in this issue, to bring light to and start a conversation about what is going on.\" U.S. figure skater Johnny Weir, who is married to a Russian-American man, says the flamboyant nature of his sport means that he can make a stance in Sochi. \"I'm quite well known in Russia so my sheer presence is a big statement against this anti-propaganda law,\" he told CNN. Former Olympic diving champion Greg Louganis says it is difficult to balance the sporting desires of athletes with the need to make a political point against the Russian law. \"Boycotts hurt the wrong people, they hurt the athletes, but we can't ignore what's going on in Sochi,\" said the American, who missed the 1980 Moscow Olympics due to a boycott and was also affected by Eastern European retaliation in snubbing the 1984 Los Angeles Games. \"It's a birthright to pursue love and not be incarcerated for loving and wanting to find love,\" he told CNN."}]}

An attorney for the family of 63-year-old Anthony Theisen said the man remains at University Hospital in Madison with numerous fractures and a brain injury caused by the March 6 accident. According to Lake Delton police, Mr Theisen fell nearly 17 feet from the Opa! Twister Steel Roller Coaster to the concrete floor at Mt. Olympus Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells. Bad ride: Anthony Theisen (right) and his wife, Kay, were enjoying a day at Mt Olympus Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells March 6 when the 63-year-old man fell from a roller coaster . Indoor attraction: Mr Theisen plummeted 17 feet from the Opa! Twister coaster . Unrestrained: An investigation revealed that Mr Theisen's lap bar became loose while the four-person cart he was on was rounding a corner . Theisen's wife, Kay Theisen, was riding in the same cart and told police her husband's lap bar unlocked when they went around a corner, hurling him into the air. Attorney Todd Korb said Theisen sustained a fractured scapula, four fractured vertebrae, fractured toes, a fractured finger and dislocated shoulder, in addition to life-threatening brain injuries. Officer Troy Spencer wrote in his police report that he checked the four lap bars in Theisen's cart several times and found three bars could not be pulled up. But, the fourth bar, where Thiesen was sitting, came unlocked. \u2018It appeared that the lap bar on Seat #1 locking mechanism was stripped. I checked the lap bars over three times to make sure Seat #1 was the only seat to come unlocked, which it was,\u2019 Spencer wrote. Police interviewed several witnesses at Mt. Olympus, including a maintenance worker who told investigators the ride was working properly during test runs that day. Pain and suffering: Mr Theisen (left) sustained a life-threatening brain injury, a fractured scapula, four fractured vertebrae, fractured toes, a fractured finger and dislocated shoulder . Theisen's attorney said a safety test was done on the ride earlier this week. Sand bags to simulate Theisen's weight were placed in the seat he was using, Korb said, and when the cart reached the point on the track where Theisen was ejected, the lap bar opened. The couple who were riding with the Theisen couple in the four-person cart said they saw the man \u2018flying out of the cart\u2019 and hurtling through the air \u2018like a rag doll,\u2019 Wisconsin Dells Events reported. Another amusement park visitor told police she rode in Theisen\u2019s very seat five minutes earlier and noticed the safety bar was slack, according to the report cited by Channel 3000, forcing her to hold onto it for the entire duration of the ride. Anthony and Kay Theisen live in Fremont, and according to the woman\u2019s Facebook page, they have three grandchildren. Tourist destination: Mt Olympus officials said it is the first time an accident of this type has occurred at the Wisconsin theme park .

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post, but they still train like athletes. When you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse. The riders, as well as their runners, follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well-balanced and healthy body. \"Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking,\" flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. \"Now we're at the peak of our fitness. It's definitely not just sitting on a horse!\" In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. Any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the British Horseracing Authority now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by Perham. Getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world's speediest steeds to the finish. The legs, lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training. Upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse. \"If you looked at a jockey without clothes on, there aren't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin,\" Perham told CNN. \"It's literally muscle and bone. Jockeys are incredibly well-toned athletes in the same way that Olympic champions Jessica Ennis or Mo Farah are.\" Racing fit . Jockey training is not for the faint of heart, or those who like a lie-in. Lane trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on Sunday mornings. \"I'm up around half past five or six most mornings,\" the 27-year-old explained. \"I'd then spend two and a half hours riding out. \"Then I'll have a cycle -- I ride 150 miles each week. The aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season. \"Before the season starts, I'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well. \"In the afternoons I go racing, and race riding keeps you pretty fit too.\" Jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the British Racing School's training suite in Newmarket. Here resident fitness coach Yariv Kam, a former basketball player, oversees bleep tests, squats (at the wall and standing on wobble cushions), timed sit-ups, push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank. All these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so-called \"Martini glass\" position. This precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills, and this is tested on the \"equisizer\" -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco. Complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket, the equisizer is a lifesize, legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. \"Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first,\" explained Perham. \"In the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time, a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance.\" One meal a day . Maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight. They are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements. In the U.S. and Great Britain, the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys. The majority are naturally slim and slight, so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss, although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds. \"I'm lucky that I can literally eat whatever I want and I won't get any heavier than 53 kg,\" explained Lane, who started riding when he was 12. \"But some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day. Mentally, it's a big task not to be eating.\" The British Racing School also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists. There is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie-counted recipes such as Mexican beans and rice, and spicy sausage hot pot. Not just about the horse . But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races? Perham concedes that the work level is split 90% to 10% in favor of the horse. But Lane, who has ridden more than 350 winners, believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit. \"People say, 'It's the horse, you just have to sit there,' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it,\" he reasoned. \"It may only be 10% us but if we're only 50% fit then the jockey can only commit 5% of the work during a race. \"If we're not as fit as we can be then we're definitely affecting the horse.\" As an example, he cited last weekend's Shergar Cup, a team event held at Britain's Ascot racecourse where jockeys compete for international teams. \"The English and European jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world. You could see at the finish they weren't as strong.\" To show how hard it is to train like a jockey, Perham put World Sport anchor Alex Thomas through his physical tests for CNN's Winning Post show. At the British Racing School, Thomas was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer. He also found he was no match for a professional jockey like Lane. In Perham's fitness assessment, Thomas managed to last 40 seconds in the sit-up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds, and while the average rider could stay in the stomach-clenching plank pose for 180 seconds, the journalist managed a third of that time. \"I knew it was going to be hard but I didn't think it would be that tough,\" Thomas grimaced at the end of his grueling physical. \"Safe to say, I won't be applying for my racing license anytime soon!\" All-round fitness . Not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey, but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred. \"The tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do,\" explained Perham. \"The simulator that I've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it's also very, very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment, similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer. It's an all-round fitness tool.\" While following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the Grand National or Breeders' Cup, Lane agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit. \"It's good for an all-round level of fitness,\" he added. \"Being fit makes everyday life so much easier.\""}]}

Thailand's immigration bureau revoked the visa of Mikhail Pletnev because it believes he poses threats to the country, according to Maj. Gen. Pansak Kasemsan. The development means that even if the charges against Pletnev are eventually dropped, he will be deported from the country. Although the revocation of the visa is already in place, an exception allows him to enter the country while his case is pending. Pletnev was arrested and charged July 6 with raping the teenage boy in the Thai beach town of Pattaya, where he owns a house. The crime carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. The judge released him on a $9,000 bail until the criminal charges against him are resolved, with the provision that he return to the seaside town of Pattaya every 12 days to renew the conditions of the bail. That means Pletnev can travel abroad as long as he continues to make his court dates. Pletnev was in Thailand on Monday and is due back in the country on July 30. His attorney said he left the country Wednesday to see his mother for her 89th birthday.

Poor rewards: 60 per cent of travellers think they need to take too many flights before they can redeem Air Miles. British Airways' rewards scheme is largely used only by business flyers . But with just 40 per cent of people who collect air miles ever redeeming them, airlines are facing calls to overhaul the schemes because they are not working. In total, there are an estimated 14 trillion points which have never been redeemed by flyers. The study also found that 79 per cent of people who travel more than seven times per year want non-travel related rewards. Loyalty programmes have changed beyond recognition since Airmiles was launched in 1988, and many experts believe that the airline industry has failed to build on early gains. Airlines don't allow flyers to redeem their airmiles or points at peak times, they expire after a period of time and they often have to spend a minimum amount. Incremental revenue experts Collinson Latitude surveyed 1,005 British flyers last year. Loyalty points: Flyers complain that it takes too long to get free trips, many have never used the points and others didn't find anything of value, the survey results show . Programme: Airmiles were originally launched back in 1988 . James Berry, product director, said: 'Traditional rewards programmes are not necessarily designed to accommodate the changing needs of customers as it takes too long to build up enough points. 'Commercial results from reward programmes are increasingly under scrutiny and just doing the same thing will not help drive incremental profitability, nor will it tackle the problem of unused points.' In total, almost half of British adults flew last year, but less than one in four - 23 per cent - said they collected airline loyalty points. Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, said that airlines need to expand their loyalty schemes. British Airways' loyalty programme is used largely by regular business flyers, while budget airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet don't run rewards programmes. Mr Sorensen told CNN.com: 'The UK is a bit of an enigma in the market, as their three largest airlines don't encourage people to sign up to their programs. 'Air France-KLM are particularly good. They have frequent promotions that allow members to redeem international awards at just half the usual miles.'"}]}

Support for shops: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to help shoppers and motorists by relaxing parking charges . Drivers could be granted a \u2018grace period\u2019 to park outside the shops for a few minutes without paying, under plans being considered by Eric Pickles. The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the \u2018war on the motorist\u2019 which is putting people off shopping in their town centres. He said parking charges had become \u2018ridiculously high\u2019 and drivers were being used as \u2018cash cows\u2019 by local councils. Mr Pickles said: \u2018We are looking at more ways to curb ridiculously high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens who pounce on those simply popping into their local shop for a pint of milk or to buy a paper. \u2018This overly aggressive stance towards the motorist is not good for the high street. Councils should be supporting their local high streets and wider economy, not using drivers as cash cows.\u2019 Sources in his department said the plans under consideration include limits on how much councils can levy, and \u2018grace periods\u2019 on parking spaces for quick trips to town centres. A few councils already allow drivers to park free for up to 30 minutes near their local shops, but it is understood similar schemes will be implemented more widely. Mr Pickles warned two years ago that town centres had become \u2018ghost towns\u2019 as people were put off shopping there by aggressive parking rules and instead turning to out-of-town supermarkets. His comments chime with the Mary Portas review, an independent report commissioned by the Government into the future of the high street, which stressed that cheap or free parking was key to the local economy. The Department for Communities and Local Government can only issue guidelines to councils, but Mr Pickles said: \u2018We are offering guidance about being reasonable. By and large councils obey guidance.\u2019 Opportunistic: The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the \u00bfwar on the motorist\u00bf which is putting people off shopping in town . Whitehall planning rules brought in by Labour in 2001 restricted the number of parking spaces in new developments which triggered an increase in parking restrictions. Councils were discouraged from setting lower parking charges to attract more shoppers into town centres. But the Government say this unfairly penalised drivers and instead drove them away. Between 2000 and 2007, average parking charges jumped 40 per cent from 86p for two hours to \u00a31.21. Research has shown that a relatively small increase in the parking charges can result in dramatic fall-offs in visitors to shops. An AA spokesperson said: \u2018It is well documented that when you have high parking charges somewhere people don\u2019t go there, and that has an impact on business and trade. \u2018Some town centres will give you 30 minutes free, so you can go into the bank or drop off a prescription and we think other authorities should see the merit of that. \u2018If it is well controlled, there will be quick turnover of spaces. People say it creates traffic, but you have balance that with the impact on the local economy to get people in to the shops. \u2018They could also follow the example of some other European and build large underground car parks where appropriate. You cannot punish people with pricing. Parking problems: Mr Pickles criticised high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens . \u2018Fuel prices are already having a big impact on people using their cars, so any extra charges drive people into out of town shops where parking is free.\u2019 But Peter Box of the Local Government Association said the Government\u2019s own figures show parking charges rose by just 1.25 per cent - less than inflation - over the past two years. He said: \u2018Claims councils are hiking up parking charges to make money off motorists are not borne out by the facts. \u2018Regulating parking is essential to keep traffic flowing, pedestrians and motorists safe, roads clear for emergency services and business deliveries, and ensuring people can park near their homes or local shops. \u2018What works in one town or city might not in another, depending on factors such as population, weight of traffic, road layout, number of car parks and who runs them. It is for councils, in consultation with residents and businesses, to decide what works best for their communities.\u2019"}]}

The number of companies going bust fell to its lowest level for seven years, it was revealed yesterday. Some 548 firms fell into administration in England and Wales between July\u00a0 and September, said the Insolvency Service. That was nearly 20 per cent fewer than the same period last year and the lowest number since the first three months of 2005. Good news: The number of companies going bust fell to its lowest level for seven years, it was revealed yesterday . Despite the positive figures, economists warned that\u00a0 recovery from recession will be long and slow as the crisis in the eurozone and slowdown\u00a0 in the global economy take their toll. A separate survey warned that Britain\u2019s builders face \u2018a long, dark winter\u2019 despite an upturn in fortunes in October. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the UK faces \u2018powerful economic headwinds\u2019. But experts welcomed the fall in businesses going bust, which coincided with the end of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. The economy grew by 1 per cent between July and September following nine months of decline. Cash-strapped companies have been helped by record low interest rates and leeway from lenders, although that has not saved black cab maker Manganese Bronze or electrical goods chain Comet. Corporate undertaker Mike Jervis, a partner at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u2018We expect these lower levels of insolvencies to continue into the\u00a0 New Year. Grim: The Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the UK faces 'powerful economic headwinds' \u2018However, what happens after that depends crucially on the confidence of the consumer and the approach taken by the so-called zombie companies to rectify their balance sheets.\u2019 A \u2018zombie\u2019 company is one which can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the debt itself, leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in\u00a0 borrowing costs or a loss of business. Lee Manning, of R3, the trade body for insolvency experts, said it estimated there are 146,000 zombie businesses. He added: \u2018Some of these have been running on empty for quite some time now, and with no reserves left in the tank, they may not be able to carry on for much longer.\u2019 Personal insolvencies in England and Wales increased for the first time in a year\u00a0 as more people struggled with unmanageable levels of debt. There were 28,062 personal insolvencies in the third quarter of the year, up 2 per cent on the previous three months but still 7.2 per cent lower than the same period last year. This figure could rise, said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust charity. \u2018Many households are running a budget deficit of their very own, and some are relying on credit to bridge the gap,\u2019 she added."}]}

But the City of Light also is rich in African-American history. Keeping this history alive are tour companies that share it, up close and personal, with visitors to France. From legendary entertainer Josephine Baker to internationally acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner to World War I's ragtime-and-jazz-playing \"Harlem Hellfighters,\" Paris has embraced African-American culture like few other places. Because of that legendary embrace -- one that black folks in the States had heard about since the 1800s -- Paris loomed large in their imaginations. To many who didn't always feel welcome in their native country, the city sounded like a place where they could emotionally exhale. \"It's always been about freedom for us,\" says Marcus Bruce, the Benjamin E. Mays Professor of Religious Studies at Bates College and author of \"Henry Ossawa Tanner: A Spiritual Biography.\" He's now researching a book on African-Americans at the worldwide Paris Exposition of 1900 and exploring their Parisian lives in the 19th and 20th centuries. Legendary Harlem-born author James Baldwin, who left for Paris in 1948, said \"African-Americans discover in Paris the terms by which they can define themselves. It's the freedom to work beyond the assumptions of what we can and can't do as African-Americans. It's a different rhythm and pace. We can imagine ourselves in new ways in that space.\" 10 fabulous free finds in Paris . That's where these treks through African-American history come in. Walking the Spirit Tours . Julia Browne launched Walking the Spirit Tours in 1994, and it became the first company to focus specifically on black American history in Paris. Back then, she says, \"I'd contact travel agents in the States and they would say, 'Why would people want to do that?'\" Times have changed for Browne, who is based near Toronto and frequently travels to France to lead tours. For example, Browne's \"Writers, Artists & Intellectuals\" tour traipses through the lively Latin Quarter and chic Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Her guests get to peek inside the Parisian caf\u00e9 where Richard Wright wrote and see the urban landscapes that inspired Boston-born painter Lois Mailou Jones. \"The Entertainers\" tour strolls still-vibrant Montmartre, the quartier where both Josephine Baker and Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith once owned clubs. Snapshots: City of Light -- and love . While 85% of Walking the Spirit tour-goers are African-American, \"We do a lot of school groups from Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and more and more French schools and organizations. It's professors in European universities who are teaching black studies,\" says Browne. \"For African-Americans or black Europeans, it creates a tremendous sense of pride and belonging. \"Paris is not just a foreign city,\" says Browne, a certified France specialist who also offers black history tours elsewhere in France. Browne has hired a 20-something Walking the Spirit tour guide who moved to Paris from the States to pursue a singing career, and her experience in the city \"brings it up to date. People enjoy hearing the real, on-the-ground stories from her.\" A new DVD vividly captures much of what Browne's tours bring to life. In \"When African Americans Came to Paris,\" Browne, award-winning documentarian Joanne Burke, and writer/cameraman David Burke feature six short videos that offer a fascinating, early 20th century look at black Americans in Paris. Walking the Spirit Tours operate year-round, with prices ranging from $60 to $70 per adult, with children up to age 15 half-price. Black Paris Tours . Oakland, California, native and former broadcast journalist Ricki Stevenson fulfilled a lifelong dream of moving to the City of Light, and in 1997 launched Black Paris Tours. Her talk show host roots are obvious as she recounts the experiences of now legendary black American expatriates for guests. With the historic Arc de Triomphe on the famed boulevard Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as the backdrop for her tour's start, Stevenson uses laminated photos and sketches as props that help bring this brand of American history to light. \"I can do five tours in one week and they won't be the same. It really depends on the people,\" says Stevenson, who like Browne frequently gets university groups from around the world. Her tours also have attracted American celebrities and politicians, including R&B star Brian McKnight and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. \"It really depends on the level of interest, the level of understanding. I've had professors of African-American history on the same day, and it was just magic.\" As she's done for years, Stevenson punctuates her historical soundtrack with a primer on Parisian protocol: \"How to be polite, what to expect, so that they get into being French for a minute.\" She advises her guests to always greet store owners and clerks with a friendly bonjour or bonsoir when entering and au revoir when leaving; to keep their voices low when on trains and buses and in restaurants. \"They may come as tourists, but I want them to leave as travelers who don't just pick up souvenirs. I try to make that correlation so they understand where they are, what the culture is. \"Having been a travel reporter for six years and traveling all over the world, I want to see where people go to shop. Take me to the 'hood. I want to see us (black Parisians) as much as possible.\" Since spring 2012, one of Black Paris Tours' four guides functions as a \"nightlife coordinator\" for guests who want to experience Paris after dark. This French-speaking guide arranges evenings on the town for guests, handles plans for dining, entertainment and transportation -- and will accompany them on these adventures. Black Paris Tours operate Monday-Friday except during late December and January. Adult tour prices range from \u20ac70 (about $94) for a two-thirds day tour to \u20ac100 (about $134) for a full-day walking-bus tour (doesn't include \u20ac10 lunch). Children from age 5 to 15 are \u20ac30 each. Discounts are available for groups of eight or more. Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris . When Houston native Dr. Monique Y. Wells began leading tours in Paris more than 10 years ago, most of her guests were university study-abroad groups. She still gets them, but Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris now has expanded to offer 12 different African-American history walks, including \"Black History in and Around the Luxembourg Garden\" and \"Montparnasse -- The Artists' World.\" Wells' company specializes in private, guided tours, and her most popular is \"Black Paris After World War II,\" which Wells says offers \"a lot of talk about the entire African-American diaspora experience.\" \"It's important for African-Americans to see there are other race struggles going on in the world,\" says Wells, whose e-book \"Black Paris Profiles,\" shares the stories of 24 black American and Afro-Caribbean folks who reinvented their lives here. \"And for people who are not black and taking the tours -- if they are Americans -- to see just how much the African-American presence has brought to Paris. The Paris they know would not be the same, and it's important for them to understand that.\" Wells mentions jazz, first introduced to France by black Americans. Not only has this music led to a French-grown jazz culture, but \"so much art from the 20th century has been influenced by jazz.\" Culinary contributions also figure into Entr\u00e9e's year-round tours. \"When I moved here, you could not find sweet potatoes on mainstream menus,\" says Wells, a co-author of \"Food for the Soul: A Texas Expatriate Nurtures Her Culinary Roots in Paris.\" Now, she says, this African-American Southern food staple is everywhere -- and served thinly sliced and fried as a bite-sized hors d'oeuvre or soup garnish. Passionate about helping tourists explore French culture through food, Wells this month will start joining Jacksonville, Florida-based Chef Amadeus for \"The Southern Passion Lounge in Paris,\" an Internet radio show. Broadcast the third Thursday of each month at 1 p.m. ET, they'll transport listeners to Parisian eateries through food, wine and music -- and also will spotlight French restaurants and chefs in the States. The newest Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris offering takes guests to the western Parisian suburbs for the \"Josephine Baker Tour in Le V\u00e9sinet.\" They'll see Le Beau Ch\u00eane, the mansion Baker owned and called home for 18 years, have lunch at a nearby American-owned bed and breakfast and learn about Baker's life over dessert. Wells and husband Tom Reeves also operate Discover Paris!, a service offering everything from gourmet food tours to self-guided downloadable walks to presentations on \"Black Paris and the Myth of a Colorblind France.\" Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris' prices range from $25-$30 for self-guided walking tours to $325 for private, guided walking tours for between one and 15 people (no per-person charge). Activities such as museum art walks and the \"Josephine Baker Tour in Le V\u00e9sinet\" are group-only; contact info@parisinsights.com for prices.

It was lauded as an event that would 'inspire a generation', but just a year after the London Olympics came to a dramatic climax new Government figures show the number of youngsters participating in sport has actually fallen. A survey of 2,000 children carried out by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has revealed nearly 75 per cent of under 10s had not been inspired to take up a sport in the after glow of the Games. The picture was slightly better for youngsters aged between 11 and 15, but even then fewer than half had been moved to get active. Worrying: Despite the Government's hope the London Olympics would encourage youngsters to take up sport, figures show fewer are now participating . Inspiration: The Government had hoped scenes such as Jessica Ennis winning the 800m to take gold in the heptathlon would encourage youngsters to take up sport . Worryingly for the Government, the figures showed there had actually been a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past five years. A report published in The Daily Telegraph claimed 25 per cent of girls aged between five and 10 had not participated in a sport in the past month - an increase of 17 per cent on the figure five years ago. One in seven boys of the same age had not participated either. And the number of children doing gymnastics, playing rounders or going swimming has also fallen away.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Mexico's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels, but it hasn't hurt its tourism industry, officials say. International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. \"The data doesn't lie,\" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. \"Tourists keep choosing Mexico.\" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing the need for trips to embassies. In 2011 to date, Mexico has seen a 40.9% increase in Brazilian tourists, a 58.1% increase from Russia and 32.8% increase from China, according to Mexico's tourism ministry. For U.S. travelers specifically, the Commerce Department's most recent data -- for 2009 -- shows that 31.7% of all U.S. international tourists go to Mexico. From 2002 to 2009, while U.S. tourism to Canada fell by more than 27%, tourism to Mexico from the U.S. increased by 5.1%. This happened even though the overall number of Americans traveling abroad decreased, from a peak of 64 million in 2007 to 61.4 million in 2009. When Kendra Young, a high school teacher in Texas, told her friends that she and her husband's family were going to Cozumel for a yearly retreat, she was met with skepticism. Are you worried, they would ask? Are you still going? \"I think people see all of Mexico as one entity,\" she told CNN. It was the third straight year that she traveled to the same resort, and security was not a concern for her. Young is pregnant, and she was more worried about food-borne or water-borne illness. She was aware of several State Department travel warnings to Mexico's cartel hot spots, but she also knew that the area she was traveling to was not affected. Her group planned to stay on the resort, where they felt safest, but on the advice of resort staff they trusted from the previous trips, they ventured into the city without worries. \"Unfortunately, there are the headline-grabbing things -- the drugs, the violence -- but I don't think that's indicative of what's happening in the entire country,\" Young said. Anaya pointed out that Americans are not unaware of the violence -- 80% of Americans who travel to Mexico go to six places, none of which have had travel alerts. The destinations are Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta/Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico City and Los Cabos, he said. Some beach destinations, like Acapulco, have been the scene of some of the drug cartel bloodshed, but still managed to increase its tourism 3% in the first five months of 2011 compared to last year, thanks to national, rather than international, tourism. But some pitfalls of tourism in Mexico persist. Tucson, Arizona, resident Denise Hermosillo and a couple of friends made the six-hour trek last week from her home to Bahia de Kino in the state of Sonora, Mexico. This area is not under a travel warning, but is not among the top destinations for American tourists. \"I was scared out of my mind to go there,\" Hermosillo said. Friends of hers who are in the military are not allowed to cross the border and urged her not to do the same. But she wanted to go to the beach to write for a book she is working on, and Bahia de Kino is the closest one. On the first day of her vacation, her group was pulled over by a police officer, who promptly asked for $100 in exchange to letting them go. In the moment she was frightened, all those stories about bloody ends in Mexico rushing to her mind. But she negotiated the bribe down to $20 and her group was allowed to continue on their journey. \"It was pretty pathetic, I thought. What are you going to do with 20 bucks?\" she said. Still, she was unable to relax during her vacation. Would she go back? She doesn't know. Would she recommend Mexico to a friend? Maybe, but only if you are traveling with someone who could act as a guide."}]}

Archaeologists more accustomed to unearthing coins and jewels during digs have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. While the artefact is less glamorous, it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the Romans to have survived. The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay. Archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. It is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since Roman times . Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at the fort, has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the Roman army, as well as everyday items like letters, shoes and babies' booties. He made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it, providing oxygen-free conditions. There are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the Roman Empire but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many Roman soldiers. Dr Andrew Birley discovered the toilet seat in a muddy trench (pictured) which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it . The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort (pictured) on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and was likely used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay . Vinolanda was a Roman fort south of Hadrian's Wall in northern England. It guarded the Roman road from the River Tyne to Solway Firth. Wooden tablets were discovered there which are considered the most important examples of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the Roman Empire. The garrison was home to auxiliary infantry and cavalry units - not parts of Roman legions. Roman boots, shoes, armours, jewellery, coins and tablets have all been found there. In 2006, a richly-decorated silver brooch featuring the figure of Mars was found. It belonged to Quintus Sollonius, a Gaul, whose name was inscribed on the brooch. It was dumped near the fort which predates Hadrian's Wall, which was constructed from the early second century. \u2018There is always great excitement when you find something that has never been seen before and this discovery is wonderful,\u2019 Dr Birley said. \u2018We know a lot about Roman toilets from previous excavations at the site and from the wider Roman world which have included many fabulous Roman latrines but never before have we had the pleasure of seeing a surviving and perfectly preserved wooden seat. \u2018As soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found. It is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable. \u2018Now we need to find the toilet that went with it as Roman loos are fascinating places to excavate - their drains often contain astonishing artefacts. \u2018Let's face it, if you drop something down a Roman latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy.\u2019 The toilet seat will go on show at the fort\u2019s museum once it has been preserved.

A social media filter that can identify risky comments or photos and urge people to reconsider what they post could stop sporting stars from being embroiled in online scandals. The real-time monitoring technology has been developed for sporting clubs in a bid to stop players from posting 'inappropriate stuff' on social media that can often tarnish a sport's brand. Former Cronulla Sharks player Todd Carney was the latest NRL player to be disgraced after he was sacked earlier this month when a photo of him urinating in his mouth was published on social media. Former NRL player Todd Carney is the most recent sportsperson to court controversy on social media after an image of him 'bubbling' was published on Twitter earlier this month . Sydney-based company, Kudos Knowledge, developed the filter to pick up risky information on Facebook and Twitter and has the potential to alert a third party like a sport club administrator. The technology will focus on the 'indiscretion' of sport stars but will also be implemented at high schools to try and stamp out online bullying. It will undergo its first trial at Sydney's Matraville Sports High School next month. Moderating tools can recognise risky posts that contain blacklisted words or phrases or if it is posted at a particular time of day, for example 1am to 5am. The Facebook or Twitter post is then automatically stalled while an alert is sent to the person about its offensive nature and asks them to reconsider posting it. Costly: NRL player Josh Dugan's career was almost prematurely ended when after a long string of trouble, he told a Canberra Raiders fan to kill himself on Instagram last year . The post can then be deleted, modified or the warning can be ignored. 'There's an optimistic hope that it will shift behaviours so players think about what they're posting on social media,' Carlton Taya, the director of Kudos Knowledge, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Hopefully this will be a solution that deals with inappropriate stuff being put out there by sporting players.' The Brisbane Broncos famously dropped contract negotiations with NRL player Josh Dugan last year after he told a Canberra Raiders fan on social media to kill himself. West Tigers captain Robbie Farah was also forced to apologise to former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012 after one of his deleted tweets resurfaced, which said Ms Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday. West Tiger player Robbie Farah posted on Twitter in 2012 that then-prime minister Julia Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday . Mr Taya said his company had been in talks with sporting clubs for the past six months about implementing the technology. 'We saw a need for clubs who are concerned about damage to their brand. You think about it, the sporting clubs are very positive about it,' he said. 'There\u2019s no big brother there looking at you, it\u2019s just monitoring and moderating.' Developers are also working on an image function where skin-coloured pixels could flag nudity, or the shapes of weapons could be identified. This could then be used to target Instagram posts and apps like Snapchat. In 2013, George Burgess joined the list of NRL players who have had explicit material of themselves posted on Twitter . The Rabbitohs player had two naked photos posted on social media, but no action was taken against him by his club or the NRL . The technology already has risky key words programmed to help moderate, but sporting clubs or schools would be able to determine exactly what should be filtered. 'Bullying has now become the number one issue in schools. So it\u2019s more about teaching students about what they should or should not be posting,' Mr Taya said. 'If a user is being called a particular name online, that keyword could be loaded into the system and then any post referencing that particular word would be filtered or blocked. 'You can keep loading in more keywords, depending on what the bullies are saying or the victims are experiencing.' The technology, which developers say is teaching a computer to understand the mean behind human actions, took 2.5 years of research and development. Josh Bootsma used social media to inappropriately message a 15-year-old fan and sent explicit Snapchat messages . The list of Australian athletes and sportspeople who have courted controversy on social media is long and diverse. In June AFL player Josh Bootsma sent a string of lurid messages to a young fan just 15 minutes after connecting with her on social media - propositioning her for sex and sending explicit Snapchat messages. As a result, the 21-year-old was later sacked by his club Carlton. English-born South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL player George Burgess was at the centre of a naked selfie scandal, when two photos of him completely naked made it onto Twitter last June, although he escaped unscathed with no action taken against him by his club or the NRL. But not all the sportspeople and athletes that have caused a stir on social media have come from football leagues. Controversial swimmer Nick D'arcy and Kenrick Monk caused an uproar when a photo of the pair holding guns in a U.S. gun store was posted on Facebook and Twitter. 'Foolish': Olympic swimmers Nick D'arcy and Kenrick Monk sparked the ire of Swimming Australia and the public when a photo of them holding guns in a U.S. gun store was posted on Twitter and Facebook . D'Arcy, pictured left, and Monk were in California on a swim camp before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken . The swimmers were on an Olympic team camp in California before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken. Calling the photo 'inappropriate' and 'foolish', Swimming Australia investigated the incident and ordered the photos to be taken down, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. As punishment, both swimmers were sent home from the London Olympics by the Australian Olympic Committee as soon as their swimming events finished and they were also banned from using social media during the games. Swimming's former pinup girl Stephanie Rice also faced intense public backlash after calling the South African rugby team 'f*****s' on Twitter in September 2010. The tweet was made on the back of a rugby union game, which saw the Wallabies beat South Africa's Sprigboks. 'Suck on that f*****s. Probs the best game I've ever seen!! Well done boys,' she posted. Following the controversy around the offensive tweet, Rice held a press conference where she offered a public apology. Crying during the conference, Rice called her comments 'a huge error of language and judgement' but the outcry saw her dumped by sponsor Jaguar. Backlash: Stephanie Rice held a press conference in 2010 after she called the Sprigboks f*****s following a game with the Wallabies . Former Canberra Raiders player Joel Monaghan was left disgraced when a photo of him simulating a sex act with a dog was posted on Twitter. The image was reportedly taken during the Raider's post-season Mad Monday celebrations in 2010. At the time then-NRL chief executive David Gallop said expressed his shock and even the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) commented on the disturbing nature of the image.

A jealous Royal Mail worker stabbed his wife 32 times and then called her father round to show him the corpse, the Old Bailey has heard. Richard Otunga, 37, is accused of repeatedly knifing Shamin Gabriel, 33, after confronting her about text messages she was receiving from other men. The court heard Miss Gabriel's father Gabby went to the couple's flat in Northolt, west London, last December and found his daughter lying in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor,. Otunga, who had a history of domestic violence, claimed he 'lost consciousness' during an argument with his wife. The court heard he later told officers: 'I killed her. She was getting text messages from men at work, we both work for Royal Mail. 'We argued and she went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and said she would kill herself, so I took it and killed her.' Prosecutor Timothy Cray told jurors that the attack was 'brutal, unnecessary and beyond any excuse that the law may provide'. He said: 'The allegation against Richard Otunga is that he murdered his wife, a lady called Shamin Gabriel. They married in 2003 and had a daughter in 2005. 'Shortly before 5am on Sunday, 29 December 2013 the defendant made a telephone call to his father-in-law Gabby Gabriel. 'He said that he had argued and fought with Shamin but there were no serious injuries. 'Mr Gabriel, getting a call like that, perhaps like any father would, caught a taxi to Northolt, arriving at 6.40am. 'He found the defendant in the hallway and noted two things - that all the internal doors were closed and that a mobile phone had been smashed into pieces in the hallway.' Ms Gabriel's father found her in a pool of blood in the kitchen of her home in Northolt, west London . He added: 'The defendant told Mr Gabriel that . Shamin had been talking to another man and was always being praised for . her beauty by other men. 'He said that he had lost consciousness and control, that he was very sorry about what he had done and what had happened to Shamin. 'Otunga opened the kitchen door and Mr Gabriel saw that his daughter was lying on the floor. She had been stabbed many times and the kitchen was covered in blood.' Mr Gabriel asked Otunga: 'Is this what you called me for, to show me the body of my daughter?' but Otunga made no reply, repeating that he was 'very sorry', the court heard. The jury heard Otunga later told police officers his wife came at him with a knife and he was trying to defend himself. The postmortem revealed she had been stabbed 32 times. Mr Cray described Otunga as a controlling and possessive husband who regularly checked his wife's phone. 'There had been previous incidents of domestic violence by the defendant,' he said. Otunga admits manslaughter at London's Old Bailey (pictured) but denies murder . 'They show a pattern of controlling and jealous behaviour on his part. 'They also suggest that the fatal attack was not some sudden or unusual event but rather a culmination of violent behaviour on the part of the defendant towards his wife, including previous threats to kill her - he had thought about it before.' Ms Gabriel had repeatedly complained to her family about his jealous behaviour, the court heard. In one allegedly incident in July 2013 Otunga held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her, Mr Cray said. A few months later he threatened to run the man who was texting his wife over with his car and murder Ms Gabriel as well, it is claimed. Otunga, of Northolt, west London admits manslaughter but denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}]}

Tories accused church leaders of playing politics last night for using their Easter messages to attack the Government over poverty and \u2018sinful\u2019 cuts. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury highlighted the plight of struggling families \u2018left broken and weeping\u2019 by hunger and debt. He told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral: \u2018In this country, even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt.\u2019 The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in his sermon: 'Even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families' And the Bishop of Truro the Right Reverend Tim Thornton spoke of the \u2018sinful consequences\u2019 of the squeeze on local authority budgets. The bishop, who sits on a committee looking at food banks, told Radio 5 Live: \u2018Politicians have to decide how to allocate resources. And in allocating some resources, you are then inevitably taking away from other people. Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes said last night: 'Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance' \u2018I am not saying it\u2019s a sin. I am saying that some of these policies lead to effects and consequences which have sinful elements in them.\u2019 The bishops\u2019 comments come amid growing unease over the use of political messages by figures in the Church of England. Last week saw a letter signed by 600 church leaders, including 36 Anglican bishops, calling on the Government to tackle what it called a \u2018national crisis\u2019 of hunger and poverty. The letter cited the rise of food banks as evidence that \u2018unfair and harsh benefits sanctions\u2019 were causing people to go hungry. But the claims contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing food poverty in Britain has reduced. Many argue there will always be an almost unlimited demand for food that is given away for free and that it does not necessarily mean people are going hungry. Last night Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes, chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: \u2018I don\u2019t remember church leaders in years gone by talking about the huge debt mountain this Government inherited, or talking positively about the number of people now back in work. \u2018Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance. David Cameron\u2019s statement that Britain is a Christian country risks dividing society, a group of leading public figures has warned. More than 50 writers, scientists, broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the \u2018negative consequences\u2019 of his assertion. Signatories include authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett, broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, philosopher AC Grayling, and human rights activist Peter Tatchell. Last week the Prime Minister wrote in the Church Times of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values. But the letter says: \u2018Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities...\u00a0 To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.\u2019 'It cheapens the message of Easter if you engage in party politics.\u2019 Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, said: \u2018You can\u2019t criticise debt from the pulpit and then have a go at a Government that is trying to do something about it.\u2019 Archbishop Welby left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after it emerged yesterday that the Church of England still has financial interests in Wonga. The Archbishop lambasted the payday loan company last year, only for it to be revealed that the church\u2019s pension fund had invested money in one of the high-interest lender\u2019s financial backers. Church Commissioners continue to hold shares in the firm worth around \u00a390,000. But in a newspaper interview on Saturday Archbishop Welby dismissed the issue, saying he had not acted because he had \u2018a million other things to do\u2019 and was not an \u2018investment manager\u2019."}]}

'The . fact is we have to find those spending reductions, and if we want to . avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we . all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget, where . we\u2019re still spending, as a country, \u00a380bn on working-age welfare.

Liberal Democrat coalition partners, after publicly ruling out their . idea of a mansion tax as an attack on people who work hard to buy their . own own. The Lib Dems want an levy on all homes worth more than \u00a32million. But Mr Cameron today said: 'I don't . actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you . save, you buy yourself a house, you try and pay down the mortgage, you . save and invest into that house - I don't want to be a country that . comes after you every year with a massive great tax. 'So that is not going to happen. But we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties. 'We will always be fair and seen to be fair,' he told the BBC.

David Cameron and his ministers will use the Tory conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party's opinion poll ratings. They include: . Ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures, but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict 'green shoots' of recovery. George Osborne, the chancellor, said he thought the economy was 'healing'. Today, Mr Cameron said he could not predict the next set of economic figures, but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced. But others are more publicly optimistic. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014, provided the Euro remained stable. 'You won't find anybody, hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community, who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing,' Mr Hammond told The Observer. Both the Conservatives and Liberal . Democrats have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will . depend on the state of the economy. He admits he must do more to \u2018explain\u2019 what the government is doing. \u2018You spend a lot of time governing and deciding, and you don\u2019t spend enough time explaining. \u2018And I think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain.\u2019 But he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy. Mr Cameron said: \u2018I think the British public are extremely fair minded. \u2018I . think they know that Britain faces difficult circumstances, they know . the hole that we\u2019re in is quite a deep one, they know it takes time to . get out,\u2019 he told the Sunday Telegraph. \u2018Of course, there are things that . we\u2019ve done that they don\u2019t like, of course there are things they wish we . had done differently. That\u2019s in the nature of things But, the public . know this is difficult and tough, and it\u2019s a five year parliament, and . my sense is that they\u2019ll judge us at the end of it rather than half way . through it. \u2018We\u2019ve got a lot to prove and there\u2019s no doubt that the mountain in front of us has got steeper and more difficult to climb.\u2019 David Cameron used interviews today to insist he will not be diverted from his 'austerity' economic plan but promised help for homeowners and commuters . The sun shone on the first day of the Tory conference, as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy . The conference theme \u2018Britain can deliver\u2019 will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future. As . delegates gather in Birmingham, the PM brushed aside claims he had . failed to take tough decisions and boasted that he had been bolder than . Mrs Thatcher. 'So have we dithered over educational reform? Mrs Thatcher never reformed public sector pensions. We have done that. \u2018Mrs Thatcher never vetoed a European treaty. I have done that. \u2018Capping welfare payments \u2014 no government has ever done that,\u2019 he told The Sun. 'If we just wanted to be popular, we would not have targeted the deficit.' Strategists . hope that taking a tough line with Brussels will recreate the opinion . poll boost enjoyed by the Conservatives after Mr Cameron vetoed a new . treaty in December last year. The . PM today said he would block 'outrageous' attempts to increase the . overall EU budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020. 'If it comes to saying 'no' to a deal that isn't right for Britain, I'll say 'no',' he told The Sunday Telegraph. David Cameron claimed today that he had been bolder than Margaret Thatcher as he promised to block 'outrageous' EU demands for an even bigger budget . And he set out a 'bold thinking' idea which would split the EU budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including Britain - outside the single currency. In one of the most eye-catching announcements, Mr Cameron said the government would cap rises in rail fares. Train companies were going to be . allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include . season tickets - by RPI inflation plus three per cent in January 2013 . and then again in January 2014. But . Mr Cameron said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to . RPI plus one per cent, or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per . cent. Some commuters will be over \u00a3200 better off over the two years. The PM insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground. 'Are the Conservatives deserting the common ground of British politics? Absolutely not. David Cameron announced that from January, season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent, and not the planned 6.2 per cent . 'I think the common ground of British politics, right now, ought to be [doing] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving, while holding onto the things that people care about passionately, like the NHS. I think that is absolutely where we are.' But Mr Cameron ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners. 'Let me be absolutely clear, . the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners . when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, . your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.' The Prime Minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by Labour as a 'tax cut for millionaires'. 'The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax, they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour,' Mr Cameron said. But Labour's Michael Dugher renewed the attack on the Tories. 'David Cameron can't be a One Nation Prime Minister. He says one thing, but time and again does another,' Mr Dugher said. 'He says those at the top will need to pay more, but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over \u00a31 million a tax break of \u00a340,000 this April.'"}]}

Property developer Jonathan Liebmann is busy rejuvenating the South African city's industrial heart after years of urban decay, with his Maboneng Precinct, on the east side of Johannesburg's central business district. Maboneng -- meaning \"place of light\" in Sotho -- is now a mixed-zone neighborhood, full of shops, restaurants and residences, which comes alive at the weekend. And it could follow in the footsteps of London's trendy East End and the shabby-chic streets of Williamsburg in New York as Johannesburg's young middle class flood to the district. Read more: Africa's tech cities and mega dams . Liebmann said: \"The area has really transformed from being a rundown industrial area into being a new living and workspace for people looking for something alternative.\" Liebmann and his team own 35 properties in the area and have developed 10 of those buildings since 2008. \"It's paid off financially, but it will pay off more in the medium to long term,\" he added. The Maboneng Precinct's first project, called \"Arts on Main\" is a creative hub boasting an in-house restaurant, rooftop bar and an exhibition space as well as a studio for some of South Africa's most respected artists. Read more: Fast-food giants target Africa . Prices for an apartment in Maboneng range anywhere from 280,000 rand ($28,500) to 3 million rand ($305,000), and Liebmann said that since he started buying up properties in Johannesburg, prices have sky-rocketed. \"Initially buildings were being bought for 100 euros a square meter,\" he said. \"I think prices have tripled, but that still makes it very competitive when you compare it to the suburbs. There are still very good deals to be enjoyed.\" But for seemingly low prices by Western standards, Maboneng still remains an aspirational area for many of the city's 3.8 million inhabitants. Despite South Africa being the continent's largest economy, 23% of the population is below the poverty line. Liebmann said that Maboneng's continued development will have a positive impact on Johannesburg, known as the \"City of Gold,\" as other similar projects spring up around the city. \"There's always a knock-on effect,\" he said, \"it's all coming together now in total regeneration.\" Another company investing in Johannesburg real estate is Kempston Group. Originally a trucking company, today Kempston Group owns 100 commercial, industrial and farming properties around South Africa. Read more: Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? And the firm is now taking on a mammoth project to transform the notorious Ponte City skyscraper in the heart of Johannesburg. When it was built in the 1970s, Ponte City was a desirable place to live. But having loomed over the city for nearly four decades, it became a symbol of the urban decay as the abandoned building fell victim to crime, drugs and prostitution toward the end of the last century. When it was taken over in 2001, after years of neglect, five stories of discarded trash had to be removed as the building's rejuvenation took place. Kempston Group founder Tony Cotterell, who is overseeing the renovation, explained: \"We bought in large conveyer belts with earth-moving equipment and we started moving it out.\" The group has invested tens of millions of dollars into the project and has already finished renovating the residential floors. Cotterell says all of the 500 apartments currently in Ponte are occupied. \"What we're creating is an environment where people can feel safe,\" said Cotterell. \"It's a big change from where it was 15 years ago. I think the whole of Johannesburg is starting to change as well.\" CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report."}]}

Bosses as Britain's biggest companies saw their taxable pay soar by 15 per cent last year, bringing the average salary of a FTSE 100 chief executive to a staggering \u00a34.72million. The increase, up from \u00a34.1million in 2012, means it now takes the head of a top company just two days to earn \u00a326,500 - the total amount the average British worker is paid in an entire year. The news comes as millions of Britons face hardship following years of pay freezes and pitiful rises below the rate of inflation, and further highlights the growing divide between the super-wealthy and those struggling to make ends meet. Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in \u00a329.8million in just 12 months, according to a study by investor research company Manifest. His taxable remuneration package, which includes base pay, pensions and long-term bonuses cashed in 2013, was almost three times higher than any other company boss. In second place was Donald Robert of financial investment firm Experian with \u00a310.1million, while Tidjane Thiam of life insurance and financial services multinational Prudential earned \u00a38.6million. In fact Sorrell's record-breaking pay was so high that nearly 30 per cent of WPP shareholders refused to back the package at a meeting last year. The figures are based on the taxable income of FTSE chief executives, not their basic salary, as such a great deal of their remuneration comes in the form of bonuses and reward schemes. This way of measuring the data in known as Total Remuneration Received.

Despite this the research will make uncomfortable reading for campaigners who have long argued that executive pay is excessive.

For many years Ricky Naputi, who at his heaviest tipped the scales at more than 400 kilograms (900 pounds), battled with his food addiction, and at the time of his death hadn't walked on his own for more than 7 years. His wife Cheryl described looking after him as 'just like taking care of an overgrown baby', and Ricky fell in and out of a deep depression over the state his life was in. The couple live on the island of Guam, just a four hour flight from Brisbane - where 6 out of 10 people are classified as either overweight or obese. Scroll down for video . The world's fattest man, Ricky Naputi, was cared for by his wife Cheryl for many years . Cheryl was Ricky's primary caretaker, and said when they married she knew what she was in for and that she very well may outlive him, if he didn't get his health in check. 'When Ricky and I met he was already a big man. So when he asked me to marry him I knew what I was getting myself into', Cheryl said during a TLC documentary - which tracked the couple's life over Ricky's final years. From there the couple embarked on a difficult and challenging journey to try and get Ricky to lose weight - each doctor giving him the same ultimatum - lose weight, or your life. The man was confined to his bed, and Cheryl did everything for him from cooking his food to cleaning every inch of his huge body, and helping him go to the toilet. Ricky was so huge he was unable to do anything on his own, and became short of breath ever just from speaking . At his heaviest the man weighed in at over 400 kilograms, or 900 pounds . Ricky could barely speak without becoming short of breath, let alone stand up or move from the bed he was confined to. He often needed the assistance of an oxygen machine. But Cheryl and Ricky had dreams to start a family and have children, despite never having consummated their marriage due to Ricky's extreme obesity. In desperation, he reached out to a woman from Houston, Texas, named Angie Flores who lost more than 80 kilograms after undergoing gastric surgery and is now an advocate for others looking to change their lives in the same way. Ricky desperately needed surgery which reduces the size of the stomach by 80 percent, but could not undergo it until he lost at least 40 kilograms on his own first. He battled with severe depression and was confined to his bed for the last years of his life . He desperately needed gastric surgery to remove 80 percent of his stomach but had to lose weight before that could take place . From there the morbidly obese man's life over the next few years took a cyclical and repetitive nature which eventually lead to the breakdown of his marriage, and later, his death. First Dr Duc Vuong, originally a refugee from Vietnam who trained in America as a obesity specialist, took the trip to Guam with Angie to assess the state of Ricky and the possibility of Ricky undergoing surgery. Dr Vuong told Ricky he must shift some weight on his own before he can even consider any procedure, and also laid some of the responsibility on Cheryl as she is the one who cooks for him. She admitted she was not strong enough to resist his begging for food - and lots of it - and said despite being immobile her husband was in control. His wife Cheryl cooked for him and struggled to say no to her husband when he insisted on more food . During one visit he was so heavy he could not even stand on the scales on his own and needed to lean on furniture . 'When it comes to food and Ricky wants something he'll keep going on and on and on and on until I finally give it to him. It's very hard because I am his wife - can I control his eating habits, no I can't.' When Dr Vuong reached out to a clinic on the Island, the head of the facility Dr John Steel gave Ricky the same ultimatum. If he couldn't lose any weight on his own then he could not be helped, it was simply too dangerous to try and perform surgery. The possibility of moving Ricky to Houston for an operation slowly became more and more impossible as he failed to lose weight, and the next step was to reach out to a doctor in Australia. World leading obesity surgeon George Hopkins, from Brisbane Australia, also made the trip to Guam to discuss the possibility of performing the surgery closer to home for Ricky - but again gave the man the same conditions. During the programme, he said: 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed' In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down. Ricky took some pills and stopped breathing. He died aged 39 . When he delivered it Ricky and Cheryl broke down, and said they couldn't handle hearing that Ricky had to lose weight on his own any more as they believed they had done all they could. 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed. I'm stuck in this bed every single day. Every single day', Ricky said through tears earlier in the documentary. In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down and Ricky took 'some pills' and stopped breathing. An hour and a half of CPR by paramedics failed to revive him and he died aged 39. Ricky's story highlights the obesity epidemic sweeping the world - and shows although he was presented with many ways out he could not overcome his demons. He described his relationship with food as 'like a bad drug addicts battle with', and his official cause of death was determined to be morbid obesity following his death on November 10, 2012."}]}

Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the \u2018habitable zone\u2019 \u2013 the distance from a star in which we might expect liquid water, and perhaps life. What did not make the news, however, is that this discovery also slightly increases how much credence we give to the possibility of imminent human extinction. Last week, astronomers said they had discovered a planet called Kepler-186f, artist's impression pictured. Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the 'habitable zone' This because of a concept known as the Great Filter. The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox: why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of solar systems in our galactic neighbourhood in which life might evolve? As the namesake physicist Enrico Fermi noted, it seems rather extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding. This apparent absence of thriving extraterrestrial civilisations suggests that at least one of the steps from humble planet to interstellar civilisation is exceedingly unlikely. This image of Kepler-186f based on what the astronomers expect it might look like. Plant life is yellow due to the manner in which it reflects light from the star but the water and clouds would probably be more orange . The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox. This paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi believed it to extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claims there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. We can think of\u00a0 this barrier as a \u2018Great Filter\u2019. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. This bottleneck for the emergence of alien civilisations from any one of the many billions of planets is referred to as the Great Filter. What exactly is causing this bottleneck has been the subject of debate for more than 50 years. Explanations could include a paucity of Earth-like planets or self-replicating molecules. Other possibilities could be an improbable jump from simple prokaryotic life - cells without specialised parts - to more complex eukaryotic life. After all, this transition took well over a billion years on Earth. Proponents of this \u2018Rare Earth\u2019 hypothesis also argue that the evolution of complex life requires an exceedingly large number of perfect conditions. In addition to Earth being in the habitable zone of the sun, our star must be far enough away from the galactic centre to avoid destructive radiation, our gas giants must be massive enough to sweep asteroids from Earth\u2019s trajectory, and our unusually large moon stabilises the axial tilt that gives us different seasons. These are just a few prerequisites for complex life. The emergence of symbolic language, tools and intelligence could require other such \u2018perfect conditions\u2019 as well. Physicist Enrico Fermi noted that it seems extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding . According to the Great Filter theory, discovering life on another planet in a solar system would suggest that the emergence of life is not that rare. If it happened independently twice in a solar system, it must have happened millions times across the galaxy. This would mean that the Great Filter is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely still to come. If the Great Filter is still to arrive, it would mean that there is some great event - such as its possible demise - that would prevent humanity from travelling to other parts of the galaxy. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long. Might every sufficiently advanced civilisation stumble across a suicidal technology or unsustainable trajectory? We know that a Great Filter prevents the emergence of prosperous interstellar civilisations, but we don\u2019t know whether or not it lies in humanity\u2019s past or awaits us in the future. For 200,000 years humanity has survived supervolcanoes, asteroid impacts, and naturally occurring pandemics. But our track record of survival is limited to just a few decades in the presence of nuclear weaponry. And we have no track record at all of surviving many of the radically novel technologies that are likely to arrive this century. Esteemed scientists such as Astronomer Royal Martin Rees at the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk point to advances in biotechnology as being potentially catastrophic. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long . Others such as Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark and Stuart Russell, also with the Cambridge Centre, have expressed serious concern about the exotic but understudied possibility of machine superintelligence. Let\u2019s hope Kepler-186f is barren. When the Fermi Paradox was initially proposed, it was thought that planets themselves were rare. Since then, however, the tools of astronomy have revealed the existence of hundreds of exoplanets. That just seems to be the tip of the iceberg. But each new discovery of an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone, such as Kepler-186f, makes it less plausible that there are simply no planets aside from Earth that might support life. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . The Great Filter is thus more likely to be lurking in the path between habitable planet and flourishing civilisation. If Kepler-186f is teeming with intelligent life, then that would be really bad news for humanity. For that fact would push back the Great Filter\u2019s position further into the technological stages of a civilisation\u2019s development. We might then expect that catastrophe awaits both our extraterrestrial companions and ourselves. In the case of Kepler-186f, we still have many reasons to think intelligent life might not emerge. The atmosphere might be too thin to prevent freezing, or the planet might be tidally locked, causing a relatively static environment. Discovery of these hostile conditions should be cause for celebration. As philosopher Nick Bostrom once said: \u2018The silence of the night sky is golden \u2026 in the search for extraterrestrial life, no news is good news. It promises a potentially great future for humanity.\u2019 Andrew Snyder-Beattie works at the University of Oxford. This article was originally published on The Conversation."}]}

President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict. However, Ahmed told a news conference he won't agree to a strict interpretation of the law, which forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. The president, speaking at his palace in the capital, Mogadishu, said local elders and religious leaders, acting as liaisons with the militants, brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two-year-old fighting. He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down. Ahmed, who was elected January 31, said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict. More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks, despite some of the heaviest fighting in months, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone, according to the United Nations. Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's action had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda.

It might sound like a nightmare scenario from a science fiction film, but one expert has claimed that China is planning on transforming the moon into a missile base. The expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth. The alleged plans have been likened to the creation of the Death Star in the Star Wars films, a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a huge army led by Darth Vader. Comparisons of China's alleged plans have been drawn with the Death Star in the Star Wars films (pictured), which is a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a super army led by Darth Vader . The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People\u2019s Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. One expert told the newspaper that the Earth\u2019s natural satellite could be turned into a giant weapon, which could be used as a military base where missiles could be directed at targets on Earth, Want China Times reported. The\u00a0English news website  compared the alleged plans to the building of the Death Star in Star Wars. The expert reportedly told the website that weapons testing sites could be set up on the moon but also that the Earth's satellite could become a base used to send crafts out to deep space. Earlier this week China launched its March-3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-3 lunar rover, which is known as Jade Rabbit and plans to send its first astronaut to the moon by 2030. The country hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon. The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People's Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. Here, soldiers watch the live broadcast of the lift-off of the Long March-3B carrier rocket carrying China's Chang'e-3 lunar probe on December 2, 2013 in Jinan, China . The nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the Chang'e-3 device, nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character, set off at 5.30pm on Sunday evening (1.30am local time). The lunar probe blasted off on board an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China's southwestern Sichuan province. The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14. The mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15 years. An expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth . President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower, and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off. If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days \u2013 three Lunar days \u2013 covering an area of about five square kilometres. It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the probe and its final landing is being closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.

A Silicon Valley real estate magnate has been accused of putting a spiked dog collar and leash on his pregnant wife before chaining her to the bed at gunpoint for two days and raping her with a golf putter. Details of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force. His Swedish wife Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while sexually assaulting her with the golf club. Berg is not the father of her child. Wife: Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed . She took the stand yesterday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial. The real estate magnate - who is worth $200 million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement. He faces 15 years to life in prison. During her testimony yesterday, Ellena shocked the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended. The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened. The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband. The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse. She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness. There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back. Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States. Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband. She is his third wife."}]}

Police are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person, latest research has shown. Human rights group, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), investigated what are known as section 60 stops, where officers detain people without suspecting them of being involved in any particular crime. The researchers discovered that while overall use of the power had fallen, excessive use against ethnic minorities had continued or in some instances increased. Racial profiling: Black people are 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (file picture) Three quarters of all Section 60 stops were carried out by the Metropolitan police, a total of 258,000 between 2008 and 2011. The next highest was Merseyside Police where officers conducted 40,940 Section 60s in the same time period. Some forces barely used the power at all. (File picture) Between 2008 and 2009 Metropolitan Police officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area . According to the EHRC, between 2008 and 2009, Met officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area. Although this fell by more than half between 2010 and 2011 to 32.8 per 1,000, in the rest of England the figure was just 1.2 per 1,000. However the highest rates of racial disproportionality were outside London with an officer in the West Midlands 28 times more likely to search a black person than a white person. Overall black people were found to be 37 times more likely to be stopped under Section 60 that white people. Asian people were 10 times more likely to be stopped. The effectiveness of the searches has also been called in to question as it was revealed that between 2008 and 2009 only 2.8 per cent of Section 60 searches resulted in an arrest falling to just 2.4 per cent between 2010 and 2011. In most cases police officers are required to have what is referred to as 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is involved in a crime before conducting a search. However the Section 60 power, which is part of the 1994 Public Order Act introduced as a response to the rise in illegal raves, gives an officer the power to stop and search a person simply because they might fear violence or disorder. Response: A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes' A spokesman for EHRC told the Guardian newspaper: 'Black youths are still being disproportionally targetted and without a clear explanation as to why, many in the community will see this as racial profiling. 'Moreover, police data itself questions the effectiveness of this practise. Some forces are using 200 or 300 stops before arresting an individual over a weapon.' A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes.'"}]}

Rielle Hunter says the first time she slept with John Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life.' Lurid details continue to emerge about the affair that annihilated the two-time presidential candidate's political career as Hunter's tell-all memoir slowly leaks to the public. The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina Senator, he called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero sleep.' Scroll down for video . Together: John Edwards in pictured in New Orleans in this December 2006 photo with Rielle Hunter, who worked as a videographer for the campaign . First night: Hunter slept with Edwards within hours of meeting him at an event at the Regency Hotel in New York City in February 2006 . Hunter claims she wrote the book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. However, the former campaign videographer seems to leave little to the imagination about her sex life. The book is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.' Hunter says she caught Edwards' eye at the hotel when she followed him out of a reception and said, 'You are so hot.' Hours later, she got a call from him inviting her to his room. She claims she went only because she thought she could give Edwards advice for his presidential campaign. But that all changed the moment she was alone behind closed doors with 'her Johnny.' 'The connection I felt when I walked in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge and unstoppable,' Hunter writes, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online. Speaking up: Rielle Hunter, with her daughter Quinn, speaks to Chris Cuomo for 20/20 . Shot at redemption: After his acquittal on campaign finance violations last month, John Edwards pledged to rebuild his public image . 'And then a moment came while we were talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.' But Hunter says she didn't give in easily to sleeping with a married man -- it took Edwards telling her a story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first night they met. 'He told me that he had an entire hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online. 'Clearly, this behavior of his was not going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. He needed this safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been that way, something happened between us.' In the public eye: Hunter's affair with John Edwards which resulted in their daughter Quinn, cost the former senator his bid for the White House . Under siege: Elizabeth Edwards, pictured here three months before she died of cancer, is called abusive and 'venomous' by Hunter . But Edwards did lie to Hunter. He lied that night about the three other mistresses -- and used the lie to manipulate her for five years. He didn't come clean about his love life until 2011, she says. Edwards had two other mistresses, he said, but both those affairs ended before his 2004 bid to become Vice President. Hunter, 48, says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine as she pursued an acting career in New York. But she got past drug abuse before she turned 30 and replaced it, she claims, with a quest for 'spiritual growth.' The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship. Hunter . attacks Edwards' wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, . calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women. Other accounts of the 2008 . presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John . Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth . Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. She . says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say . Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential . candidate. Hunter . repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and . Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that . the baby was not his. He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two. Hunter's book is a window into the life of a political mistress. Tell-all: In an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air on Friday, Rielle Hunter describes her life as a political mistress . Major . New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book, . citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a . Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books. She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail. They . often shared hurried dinners over take-out before short, passionate . romps. Then, Edwards had to leave and return to his cancer-stricken wife . and his life in the public eye. When Edwards faced the prospect of an . indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he . would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a . country club than a jail. Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts . She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened. Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts. The . judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors then said in a court . order earlier this month that they wouldn't retry Edwards, and the . charges against him were dropped. Neither Edwards nor Hunter testified. Prosecutors . had accused Edwards, 59, of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 . million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his . pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday it expects to grant a permit to the Shiloh IV Wind Project, a 3,500-acre wind farm near Rio Vista, California, within 30 days that would allow for the deaths of five golden or bald eagles over a five-year period without the wind farm's operators being penalized. \"The permit, the first of its kind, requires the company to engage in conservation measures that protect the local population of golden eagles, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the company,\" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said  in a statement. Shiloh, which is a subsidiary of EDF Renewable Energy, also produced what the federal service described as a conservation plan to help minimize the wind farm's impact, not only on eagles, but on bats and other migratory birds, as well. \"The Shiloh IV eagle permit sets a precedent for proactive and collaborative eagle conservation at wind farms in northern California,\" according to a statement from service director Dan Ashe. Garry George is the Renewable Energy Director for Audubon California, a state program of the National Audubon Society. He says the conditions of the permit are still unclear because the permit has not been issued yet. \"We don't like it when any bird is killed. We certainly don't like it when any eagle is killed,\" George told CNN Thursday. But the group has supported the permits as a way to work with the industry to help it minimize the number of bird deaths on wind farms. \"We think the permit process is one way to do that.\" He added \"we hope it provides conservation, but we don't know if it will.\" It's unclear exactly how many eagles, in addition to other birds, are killed by the powerful turbines on wind farms every year. Only a small percentage of farms actually count the birds that are killed by the power turbine blades. \"Farms aren't required to count the number of birds killed.... I've seen various numbers. I don't think we really know, but it's a lot,\" George said. Bald eagles, in particular, are protected under federal laws, even though they are no longer on the endangered species list. A wind farm could incur steep penalties in the event of eagle deaths. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the permits help protect wind farms from accidental eagle deaths. The Shiloh wind project, northeast of San Francisco, is expected to help California meet its goal of producing 33% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020."}]}

The blonde says that she had a fulfilling sex life with Phelps, who made her feel 'like the most beautiful woman in the world'. The pair are no longer together, but for reasons that Chandler won't disclose. She insists that the split is not because she was forced to admit her past, and says that the reason  is for Phelps to disclose. Chandler admitted on a\u00a0Facebook\u00a0post that she'd been born an 'intersex' \u2013 someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries - with the name David Roy Fitch. She later had surgery. She wrote: 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man. 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' GUILTY: Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps walks into a courthouse Friday morning for a trial on drunken driving and other charges. He pled guilty . After his arrest Phelps went to rehab. He was busted with a .14 blood alcohol level. He has since gone to rehab . She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. Showing some skin: Photos of Michael Phelps in a jail cell after his DUI arrest have been released . The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident. On Friday Phelps pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and received 18 months of supervised probation and a one-year suspended jail sentence. The 18-time Olympic gold medalist was arrested for drunken driving early on September 30 after speeding and then crossing the double yellow lines inside a Baltimore tunnel, police said. 'The last three months of my life have been some of the hardest times I've ever gone through, some of the biggest learning experiences I've ever had,' Phelps, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, told reporters. 'I'm happy to be moving forward. I'll continue to grow from this.' Phelps, 29, was clocked by radar at around 1:40 a.m. traveling 84 miles per hour (135 kph) in a 45-mph (72-kph) zone, police said, adding that he blew a .14 on a Breathalyzer, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Maryland. He faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 'I hope we don't have this conversation again and I'm optimistic that we won't have this conversation again,' Judge Nathan Braverman told Phelps during his sentencing. Police said an officer followed Phelps' 2014 Land Rover onto northbound Interstate 95, through the Fort McHenry Tunnel, and pulled him over just beyond the tunnel's toll plaza. The drunken-driving arrest was the second for Phelps, who has spent most his life working feverishly in the pool but admits he likes to have a good time when not competing. Following his arrest, Phelps, who is eyeing a spot on the U.S. team for the 2016 Olympics, was suspended for six months by USA Swimming and barred from representing the United States at the 2015 FINA World Swimming Championships in Russia. Phelps said he completed a 45-day rehab program at an Arizona treatment center following his arrest, continues aftercare in Baltimore, and will participate in Alcoholics Anonymous."}]}

There are more of you out there than you might think. Clark Howard: Before jumping at all the new car deals, think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. CNW Marketing Research, a respected automotive marketing research firm, reports that 4 million used cars were purchased in the United States during the month of May alone. That's amazing when you consider that the market for new cars is 9 million in the United States over the course of an entire 12 months. Yet don't overlook the new car as a potential purchase just yet. New data from Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they've been since records started being kept in 1979. In fact, the average new car is now $1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008. And we've got more price cuts coming because of oversupply. As you probably know, I'm a used car guy, the self-proclaimed champion of driving a car until the wheels fall off. So I can't believe the advice that I am about to give ... but it's now possible to get a better deal on a brand new car than on a relatively new used car. Watch Clark Howard talk to a woman who learned what not to do when buying a used car \u00bb . It's really just a classic case of supply and demand. The used car market is up about 23 percent, and new car sales are down 34 percent, according to CNW. More new cars on dealer lots mean more deals for you. But realize this: It's just a temporary phenomenon. Do not take this blip on the radar as gospel for the future; in most instances, a used car will almost always be a better buy. Just not right now. When buying a new vehicle, you want to start by arranging your financing first. Go to your bank or credit union and prequalify for a car loan or apply online. This will tell you how much car you can afford and what type of monthly payment you will have to budget. Next, you want to get a price for the car you have in mind. In the past, I've talked about using CarsDirect.com to get a guaranteed quote. A car dealer then can do his or her best to beat that online quote and win your business. In some cases, the price from CarsDirect.com winds up being the best a consumer can get. But now there's a new kid on the block known as Zag.com. This service gives buyers instant guaranteed upfront prices from a network of certified dealers. It also offers an easy delivery process that helps you avoid \"the grind\" at a dealership. Do you know what \"the grind\" is? That's when you're at a dealer lot, and the sales representative says he or she will go talk to the manager about getting you the best deal. Instead they go watch TV for five minutes, and then come back and tell you that the manager couldn't help out with a good price -- despite their best efforts on your behalf. That's why sites such as Zag and CarsDirect are so appealing; they take you out of the car dealers' ballpark and put you on level playing ground. But before you jump at all the new car deals, take a moment to think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. It's more than just the sticker price and the expense of gas. AAA reports that the true annual cost of owning and operating a car is $9,369. Ouch. That $9,369 takes into account somewhat hidden costs such as insurance, maintenance, interest on a car note, depreciation and other factors. Hey, maybe driving your current car until the wheels fall off is still a great idea."}]}

So it was no surprise that, when faced with rising energy costs, Saylor turned to technology. He tapped into an abundant and easily accessible energy source: manure from about 600 cows.  Watch how cow poo powers the farm \u00bb . \"It's a pretty simple process. There's not really a lot to it,\" Saylor said. \"Manure comes from the cows, and there's energy left in the manure.\" The process is known as anaerobic digestion, and here's how it works: . With the help of a mechanical scraper in the barn, manure drops into a 19,000-gallon tank. The slurry then moves into the digester, which is 16 feet deep and 70 feet in diameter. It's heated there for about 16 days while the bacteria break down the organic matter in order to produce methane gas. That gas is burned in two engine generators to make electricity.  See an interactive explaining the process \u00bb . Heat created by the generators keeps the digester hot, heats the buildings around the farm and helps provide hot water. The electricity is used to power this farm and a dozen neighboring homes, Saylor said. And there's still some left over, which he sells back to the grid. Overall, the poo power helps Saylor's bottom line. \"In savings, there's $200,000 a year, in either extra income from sale of electricity or cost offsets,\" he said. \"So you're talking about system project costs of over a million dollars to build the system but a payback of five years or less.\" Before he installed the system, the pungent smell from the cows could linger for three to four days, Saylor said. \"The farm used to get a lot of complaints from motorists, which is understandable. It used to stink a lot.\" Now, the digesters reduce 98 percent of all odor, although he admits that if the wind blows, you still \"get a whiff.\" The farm's leftover solid waste is sold to the community. \"We use it for bedding for the animals,\" according to Saylor. \"A lot of people like to get it for their gardens ... because it doesn't smell much.\" Farm-based digesters became popular in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. But the technology didn't catch on, possibly because of the high operational costs and declining energy prices, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although Saylor had been interested in digesters for years, his dream didn't become reality until 2006. That's when he received a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection. But Saylor's work isn't done. He intends to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel. He said his goal is to waste nothing. \"In a biodiesel system, all the waste products can either be used or fed back into the digester to make more gas,\" he said. \"I've always looked at new technologies and believed you kind of have to work with that stuff to stay with the future.\""}]}

Geared up: NHS paramedics are being issued with bullet-proof jackets like this one in case they have to respond with a Mumbai-style attack in Britain . Paramedics will be issued with bullet-proof jackets and trained to respond to a Mumbai-style terror attack, it emerged today. NHS volunteers are being trained to deal with the aftermath of a 'marauding terrorist gun attack' like the one which left 164 dead in the Indian city in 2008. Most will be trained to treat battlefield casualties over the next four years. However, body armour and initial guidance has already been given to small teams of ambulance and fire crews in key areas. The policy was mooted in a Home Office paper in the summer and confirmed for the first time by the Department of Health this weekend. 'The government has to prepare for the worst and we also need to be certain that lessons are learnt from previous terrorist attacks at home and abroad,' the department told The Sunday Times. 'Where specialist ambulance crews may be asked to respond to incidents involving firearms, it is necessary that they receive proper training and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.' The move, which according to one military source was designed to replicate protection given to the army, was applauded by former terrorism czar Lord Carlile as a 'very sensible precaution'. Worst-case scenario: A victim of a gun attack lies on a hospital bed at the St George's hospital in Mumbai, India, in November 2008. Indian medics had to treat the dying and injured in perilous conditions . Disaster zone: A policeman stands guard after shootings at a railway station in Mumbai. The response to the atrocities was far more like going into battle . It harks back to the days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland when bullet-proof jackets were used by ambulance staff at the height of the conflict. However, this is the first time the equipment has been given to medics on the mainland. The atrocities, which had been planned for a long time in advance, involved 10 co-ordinated bombing and shooting assaults by Islamists on hotels and restaurants in the country's largest city. Scotland Yard has been warning hotels, restaurants and financial companies about the possibility of copycat attacks in Britain. On the front line: Paramedics are afforded a reasonable amount of protection when dealing with dangerous incidents, but the government believes this should go a step further amid terror threats to Britain ."}]}

Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . Listeners to BBC radio were assured that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial. Breathlessly, reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to unlawful detention and internment, they said. A little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, it was Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place. In January 2010 he wrote on the Guardian\u2019s website: \u2018My firm\u2019s next case focuses on the UK\u2019s detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities.\u2019 Mr Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardo\u2019s charity before founding his own firm in 1999. The father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was awarded the title \u2018Human Rights Lawyer of the Year\u2019 in 2004. He has repeatedly denied that he is an \u2018ambulance chaser\u2019 and calls the idea that he trawls for work\u2018 laughable\u2019. His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. Nearly \u00a33million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men. Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were brought to the British courts. Public Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held . The firm\u2019s interests are, however, not exclusively abroad. It says its mission is \u2018helping individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who govern us both nationally and locally\u2019. Its most recent highly-publicised domestic case was last month when it represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers in Surrey libraries on the grounds they had not received equality training. It won the case and the county council was barred by a High Court judge from using volunteers to work in its libraries. This was, said Mr Shiner, a \u2018fantastic result\u2019. The libraries are now threatened with closure."}]}

But they shouldn't be. The collapse of the Iraqi government's troops in Mosul and other northern cities in the face of Sunni militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration, brought on by the government's politicization of its security forces. The politicization of the Iraqi military . For more than five years, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his ministers have presided over the packing of the Iraqi military and police with Shiite loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led Iraqi troops in the battlefield gains of 2007-2010, a period during which al Qaeda in Iraq (the forerunner of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was brought to the brink of extinction. Al-Maliki's \"Shiafication\" of the Iraqi security forces has been less about the security of Iraq than the security of Baghdad and his regime. Even before the end of the U.S.-led \"surge\" in 2008, al-Maliki began a concerted effort to replace effective Sunni and Kurdish commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed-sect areas of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces to ensure that Iraqi units focused on fighting Sunni insurgents while leaving loyal Shiite militias alone -- and to alleviate al-Maliki's irrational fears of a military coup against his government. In 2008, al-Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister's Dawa Party, and even Shiite militia members from the south. A number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with al-Maliki loyalists. The moves were made to marginalize Sunnis and Kurds in the north and entrench al-Maliki's regime and the Dawa Party ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009, 2010 and 2013. The dismantling of the 'Awakening' It's no accident that there exists today virtually no Sunni popular resistance to ISIS, but rather the result of a conscious al-Maliki government policy to marginalize the Sunni tribal \"Awakening\" that deployed more than 90,000 Sunni fighters against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. These 90,000 \"Sons of Iraq\" made a significant contribution to the reported 90% drop in sectarian violence in 2007-2008,  assisting the Iraqi security forces and the United States in securing territory from Mosul to the Sunni enclaves of Baghdad and the surrounding Baghdad \"belts.\" As the situation stabilized, the Iraqi government agreed to a plan to integrate vetted Sunni members of the Sons of Iraq into the Iraqi army and police to make those forces more representative of the overall Iraqi population. But this integration never happened. Al-Maliki was comfortable touting his support for the Sons of Iraq in non-Shiite areas such as Anbar and Nineveh provinces, but he refused to absorb Sunnis into the ranks of the security forces along Shiite-Sunni fault lines in central Iraq. In areas with (or near) Shiite populations, al-Maliki saw the U.S.-backed Sons of Iraq as a threat, and he systematically set out to dismantle the program over the next four years. As this process played out, we saw its effects firsthand in our interactions with Iraqi government officials and tribal leaders in Baghdad, where it was clear the Sons of Iraq were under increasing pressure from both the government and al Qaeda. By 2013, the Sons of Iraq were virtually nonexistent, with thousands of their sidelined former members either neutral or aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in its war against the Iraqi government. The disappearance of the Sons of Iraq meant that few Sunnis in western and northern Iraq had a stake in the defense of their own communities. The vast system of security forces and Sunni tribal auxiliaries that had made the Sunni provinces of Iraq hostile territory for al Qaeda was dismantled. The militant gains in Mosul and other cities of the north and Anbar are the direct result of the removal of the Iraqi security forces commanders and local Sons of Iraq leaders who had turned the tide against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. Those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with al-Maliki loyalists from Baghdad who, when the bullets began to fly, had no interest in dying for Sunni and Kurdish territory. And when the commanders left the battlefield this week, their troops melted away as well. What can be done? The problem will only get worse in the coming months. Now that the Iraqi government's weakness in Sunni territories has been exposed, other Sunni extremist groups are joining forces with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  to exploit the opening. The Baathist-affiliated Naqshbandi Army and the Salafist Ansar al-Sunna Army are reportedly taking part in the offensive as well, and they are drawing support from a Sunni population that believes itself persecuted and disenfranchised by al-Maliki's government and threatened by Shiite militias that are his political allies. For six months, Shiite militants have been allowed or encouraged by the government to conduct sectarian cleansing in mixed areas around Baghdad, particularly in Diyala province between Baghdad and the Iranian border. These events contributed to the motivation of Sunnis who have taken up arms or acquiesced in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's offensive. Even as the ISIS tide rolls southward down the Tigris, there is probably little danger of Baghdad and other Shiite areas falling into Sunni insurgent hands. The Shiite troops unwilling to fight to hold onto Mosul will be far more motivated to fight to protect Shiite territories in central and southern Iraq and to defend the sectarian fault line. This is their home territory, where they have the advantage of local knowledge, and where they have successfully fought the Sunni insurgency for years. In the north, however, al-Maliki now has two military options. He can reconsolidate his shattered forces along sectarian fault lines to defend Shiite territories in central Iraq, ceding Sunni areas to the insurgency, or he can regroup his security forces at their bases north of Baghdad and mount expeditions to conduct \"cordon and search\" operations in Sunni areas lost to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. If al-Maliki chooses to regroup and move on Sunni population centers controlled by the ISIS, we are likely to see Shiite troops unfamiliar with Sunni neighborhoods employing heavy-handed tactics, bluntly targeting Sunni military-age males (12-60) not affiliated with the insurgency and further inflaming sectarian tensions as they do so -- reminiscent of the situation in many parts of Iraq in 2005-2006. The problem at its core is not just a matter of security, but politics. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allies would not have had the opportunity to seize ground in the Sunni Arab-dominated provinces of Salaheddin, Nineveh and Anbar if there had been more inclusive and sincere political outreach to the mainstream Sunni Arab community. In the end, the solution to the ISIS threat is a fundamental change in Iraq's political discourse, which has become dominated by one sect and one man, and the inclusion of mainstream Sunni Arabs and Kurds as full partners in the state. If al-Maliki truly wishes to restore government control to the Sunni provinces, he must reach out to Sunni and Kurdish leaders and ask for their help, and he must re-enlist former Sons of Iraq leaders, purged military commanders and Kurdish Peshmerga to help regain the territory they once helped the Iraqi government defend. But these are steps a-Maliki has shown himself unwilling and unlikely to take. At this point, al-Maliki does not have what it takes to address Iraq's problem -- because he is the problem."}]}

The senior vice-president of a legal insurance company is suing Google over her corporate photo and mocking comments that were published on a satirical website. SexyExecs.blogspot.com is a Google-hosted blog that takes company headshots of business executives and adds humorous, sometimes offensive, commentary. Ann Dieleman, Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer at ARAG North America, filed a lawsuit against Google last week over the photo that they say the internet giant has refused to take down. Unfair: Ann Dieleman and her company, have filed a copyright suit over this post on a blog hosted by Google . Dieleman's picture appeared on the site in December 2009, with critical comments about her appearance and gums. The posting added: 'Sadly, Ann doesnt hold up to the sort of advanced, high levels of scrutiny people are subjected to these days. It's not us doing this, it's celebrity-obsessed media culture. Blame Heat magazine.' Challenge: Ann Dieleman says she is asserting her legal rights and Google have refused to remove the offending picture . ARAG, based in Des Moines, and Dieleman say they have tried and failed to get Google to take down the picture - so they took out a copyright suit against the company on December 31, 2013. 'We've followed the appropriate procedures to remove the content. 'However, after continued back and forth it was time to assert my legal rights,' Dieleman said, reported by the Des Moines Register.

They say they informed Google in September 2012 that SexyExecs' use of the corporate photo infringed their copyright. According to the court documents, Google responded later that month saying they had decided not to remove the content. 'As always, we encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the . blogger in question,' Google emailed back, as stated in the suit. But Dieleman and ARAG have continued with legal proceedings.

Police continue to question a man arrested on suspicion of her abduction but said they urgently need help from the public to trace his movements during the crucial hours after April was snatched from a street Monday. Mark Bridger, 46, remains in police custody and will be questioned again Thursday, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police. A team of officers is working around the clock to try to piece together Bridger's movements between Monday evening and his arrest Tuesday afternoon, Bevan said, using forensic analysis and witness statements. But, he said, more help is still needed from people who may have seen or spoken with Bridger at that time. \"We are appealing for anyone who has had contact with Mark; we don't have the complete picture yet,\" Bevan said. British Prime Minister David Cameron added his voice Thursday to the plea for information made by April's family, an unusual intervention by the country's leader in an ongoing police search. \"My heart goes out to April Jones's family. I appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything to talk to the police,\" he said via his official Twitter feed. Speaking at Downing Street, Cameron also mentioned the extra concern prompted by the news that April has cerebral palsy, a condition his late son Ivan also suffered. The girl's abduction as she played with a friend on a street near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, has shocked the small, close-knit community -- and made headlines across the United Kingdom. There has been no trace of the pretty brown-haired child since she was seen Monday evening, climbing into a vehicle that then drove off. April's mother, Coral Jones, made an emotional televised plea for help Wednesday. \"It has been 36 hours since our April was taken from us,\" she said, breaking down in tears. \"There must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her. \"We are desperate for any news -- April is only 5 years old. Please, please help us find her.\" Local volunteers have joined police and rescue teams in searching the town and surrounding area, a task made more difficult by poor weather, flooding rivers and hilly terrain. Police said Wednesday that the search was focused on more than 20 different areas, including houses, outbuildings, river banks and open countryside. \"The geography is very challenging and everyone is working in a hostile environment -- by that I mean the terrain is difficult, waterlogged, working near to flooded rivers with the potential for mine shafts and unstable ground,\" police Superintendent Ian John said. Police dogs, coast guard teams, kayakers and mountain rescue specialists have been called in to assist in the search."}]}

The Little Rock Police Department arrested Arron Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, after an arrest warrant issued Sunday said he was charged with kidnapping. The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter. Carter went to show a home in the small community of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished. Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday morning that his investigators were questioning Lewis. When asked whether the suspect was talking, Holladay said: \"We will have to see how cooperative he is as the day progresses.\" Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Suspect was in wreck . Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident, and \"Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,\" the report says. Another witness told police that \"the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,\" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said. \"While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,\" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They resumed their search Monday in two areas in the southern part of the county, the sheriff said. \"At this point we don't know where she is,\" Holladay said. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The Sheriff's Office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. Official: Agent's cell phone used . The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he \"knew something was wrong.\" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. \"I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,\" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. \"She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.\" The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that \"I would just like to have my wife back.\" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said. CNN's John Branch and Joe Sutton contributed to this report."}]}

Mrs Andrade was just 14 and 15 when the abuse happened, but only came forward when she confided in a friend at a dinner party in 2011 and was alarmed that Brewer was still teaching. The court heard she was prescribed anti-depressants after talking to police, and had twice tried to take her own life in December 2012 and January 2013. Her husband, Levine Andrade, 59, found his wife, known as Fran, dead at 8am on January 24 last year. He said: 'She fell into incredible despair, the truth hit home. It was not something she wanted to report to the police. 'It brought back horrible memories from her past. 'Life took a real downturn after the court proceedings - that was when she was at her complete lowest. 'Apart from the trial bringing it all back up, she felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally. 'It got her completely down and she felt completely defenceless. I think she felt she was not prepared enough for the trial. She was not expecting to be attacked personally and have to answer so many direct questions in public. 'The words she used were: she felt as if she were the one on trial.' Brewer and his ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were jailed after being convicted of sexual abuse . The court also heard Mrs Andrade had met Brewer on two occasions since the abuse, and even asked him to hand himself in. Mr Andrade said his wife's mood changed after being asked to give a video interview for Surrey Police about the abuse she suffered, saying: 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end. She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' He said she would come downstairs to make herself food, go back to bed, while he took on caring for the children and teaching as well. 'It was very out of character, she loved the children, absolutely adored them,' he said. 'It got harder and harder towards the last few months. She did not want to speak to anybody.' 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end.\u00a0 She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' Levine Andrade on his wife, Frances . On the morning of her death, Mr Andrade, himself a musician and teacher, went to offer his wife a cup of tea and noticed she was cold. After phoning for an ambulance, one of the couple's sons attempted CPR but when paramedics arrived they pronounced her dead. Mr Andrade was also asked if there were any other issues that could have caused his wife's anxiety but said while family finances were a 'problem', it was only because they had used their savings to pay the children's school fees. Mrs Andrade, who was adopted, had also traced her birth mother to Canada but found out she had two forms of cancer. Mr Andrade said: 'She felt helpless that she was far away and could not do anything.' In April this year, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade's death 'could and should' have been prevented, and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids. Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated. The inquest continues and is scheduled to run into next week.

The playful tabby arrived in Nicole\u2019s life 15 years ago as a lively kitten and soon became a big part of her family. \u2018Poppy was always such a boisterous little thing,\u2019 says Nicole, 38, an insurance underwriter from Epping, Essex. \u2018She loved being out in the garden and every summer I\u2019d look out of the window and see her flying through the air trying to catch butterflies. Then at night she\u2019d be so loving and would curl up close to me on my bed. That\u2019s the thing I miss most, our snuggle time.\u2019 Mourning: Nicole Green, 38, is grieving for her cat Poppy, 15, who was diagnosed with dementia last December . Nicole, who is married to James, 31, a fireman, and has three children, Macey, 14, Archie, seven, and George, eight weeks, admits that she wells up when she reminisces about her pet. But Poppy isn\u2019t dead. She is one of more than 1.3\u2009million British cats and dogs with dementia, which has a devastating effect on their lives \u2014 and those of their owners. \u2018Every night it takes me two or three hours to try to settle her to sleep because she\u2019s so distressed and doesn\u2019t know where she is,\u2019 says Nicole. \u2018She\u2019ll miaow loudly and pace up and down for ages before she sleeps. \u2018In the morning I\u2019ll come downstairs and whereas before she used to jump off the table and come purring around my legs, now she simply doesn\u2019t respond. She just stares blankly back at me and it\u2019s obvious she has no idea who I am. It breaks my heart. \u2018She never used to have toilet accidents but now it happens most nights. Sometimes when the back door opens she will wander outside and I feel a huge sense of panic because if she gets lost, she won\u2019t be able to find her way home again. She can\u2019t even find her bowl.\u2019 Snuggle time: Nicole cuddling Poppy (left) and Poppy as a kitten (right) Recent research from the University of Edinburgh found that half of all cats over the age of 15 and a third of those aged 11 to 14 suffer from dementia. Another study found that 41\u2009per cent of dogs aged 14 and over and 23\u2009per cent of those aged 12 and over also suffer. Although most studies so far have focused on cats and dogs, owners are reporting behaviour similar to dementia in a variety of animals, including rabbits, guinea pigs and even parrots. If your pet is eight or older, and you answer yes to one or more of these questions, consult your vet: . Does your pet pace or wander aimlessly, finding it hard to settle? Does it stare blankly as if unaware of surroundings? Does it fail to recognise or respond to familiar people such as family and friends? Does it get lost or confused in the home or garden? Is it forgetful \u2014 for example, forgetting to go to the toilet or repeatedly seeking attention? Does it vocalise repeatedly or for no reason? The irony is that the disease is actually a result of domestic animals living beyond their natural life expectancy, as loving owners pay out for expensive food, medication and surgery to keep their pets alive. \u2018The main form of dementia in animals is called Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome, which is a degenerative brain disease remarkably similar to Alzheimer\u2019s in humans,\u2019 explains Jon Bowen, Honorary Lecturer in Small Animal Behaviour at the Royal Veterinary College, London. \u2018As with humans, areas of the brain stop working properly which leads to problems with learning, memory, sleep patterns, social interaction\u00a0 and continence.\u2019 Bowen believes that, just as humans are increasingly suffering from dementia due to our rising life expectancy, our pets are being stricken by the disease because they are living longer than ever. The average dog now lives to the age of 12 and a cat to 14. So, to some extent, animal-loving owners are responsible for the rise in dementia. \u2018Years ago we weren\u2019t seeing pets live until 17 or 18 years of age and nowadays we do,\u2019 says Mr Bowen. \u2018Their brains aren\u2019t evolved to live so long \u2014 they wear out.\u2019 The rise is so sudden that animal insurer Petplan recently revealed claims for vet appointments regarding dementia have increased by 23\u2009per cent for dogs and 48\u2009per cent for cats over the last three years. Michael Davies, Associate Professor in Small Animal Clinical Practice at the University of Nottingham, says \u2014 as with humans \u2014 experts are still in the dark as to why some animals are afflicted and not others. \u2018Loss of cognitive function with age in dogs and cats is associated with similar structural changes in the brain to people \u2014 an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain tissue. \u2018The amyloid accumulates within the nerve cells in the brain, altering how it functions.\u2019 Heartache: Nicole says the affect of dementia on your pet, and your life as an owner, can be devastating . Nicole found out that Poppy had dementia . last December. Vets usually diagnose the condition after hearing about . the change in the pet\u2019s behaviour, and undertaking a full physical . examination and a range of tests. Loving friend: As Poppy is not in pain Nicole and her family plan to make her comfortable until the end . Putting down a pet with serious dementia may be an option, particularly if they are in physical pain or injuring themselves. However, it is not always the kinder option, as senile pets can live perfectly comfortable lives. \u2018Some days Poppy doesn\u2019t even remember what she likes eating any more,\u2019 says Nicole. \u2018A few weeks ago she left a bowl of her favourite cat food and went into the living room and lapped baked beans off my son\u2019s plate. She never liked them before. She also gets disorientated and walks round and round the garden like she\u2019s trying to get her bearings. \u2018Three months ago Poppy managed to squeeze through a gap in the fence and I found her wondering in the grounds of the local hospital looking lost. \u2018We were told that there\u2019s no medication we can give her. She\u2019s not in pain so the kindest thing is to make her comfortable at home and spoil her. I\u2019ll be her best friend to the end. She has been a loving friend to me.\u2019 As well as the one million cats with dementia in the UK, there are 300,000 dogs who suffer from the condition, too. Janice Care\u2019s 12-year-old Airedale terrier, Zoe, was diagnosed a year ago. \u2018She was such an energetic and playful little dog,\u2019 says Janice, 45, a housewife who is married to Steve, 48, a furniture manufacturer, and mum to Jade, 21, Rosie, 18 and Freddie, 16. \u2018As she got older, she started to sleep more. Then a year ago we noticed her bumping into furniture and getting lost on walks, which was heartbreaking. Heartbroken: Janice Care, 45, and her Airedale terrier Zoe, 12, who was diagnosed with dementia a year ago . \u2018We took her for a check-up and discovered she\u2019d gone partially deaf and blind in her old age. \u2018But something still didn\u2019t add up and six months later Zoe started behaving oddly and barking for no reason.\u2019 Janice, from Ongar, Essex, took Zoe back to the vet, who\u00a0 diagnosed dementia. \u2018We weren\u2019t told about any medication that could help Zoe so we just got on with caring for her ourselves. It helps that we also have Darcie, a three-year-old schnoodle (a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle), and she encourages Zoe to get up and play. She even helps guide her round the house.\u2019 Elderly pets: Zoe is one of 300,00 dogs in the UK who suffer from the condition, with 41 per cent of dogs aged over 14 suffering and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over . Alison Stratford, 56, a research manager from Bracknell, Berkshire, cares for her mother Glenys, 88, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. Alison realised her 20-year-old cat Toffee had dementia when he started displaying similar symptoms to her mother. Cat protection: Alison, 56, with her cat Toffee, 20 (left) and Toffee as a young cat (right) \u2018My mother would often eat her dinner, I\u2019d take the plate away, then sit down to eat mine and she\u2019d shout and ask me, \u201cWhere\u2019s my dinner?\u201d She thought she hadn\u2019t had it and wanted it again. \u2018Toffee would do the same. He\u2019d eat his dinner and instead of curling up and sleeping, he\u2019d go back and stand by his bowl and miaow for it all over again. \u2018I volunteer as a welfare officer for Cat Protection and I\u2019m trained in cat health\u00a0 so my heart sank. I knew it\u00a0 was dementia.\u2019 Surprisingly, despite the rise in pet dementia, it often goes under-reported by vets. Symptoms: Alison recognised Toffee was suffering from dementia because he started displaying similar behavior to Alison's mother, a dementia sufferer . \u2018We may be detecting only about one in eight cases because signs of dementia just aren\u2019t visible in a consultation,\u2019 says Jon Bowen. \u2018We rely on owners to spot the signs and tell us. If you diagnose a senile pet early, you can get in quickly and start treating them sooner with much better results. Just six months can see a pet decline rapidly.\u2019 Some owners say pet dementia can be slowed down using games to exercise and stimulate their animals, although there is no cure. Gently stroking Poppy, who is now purring softly, Nicole knows only too well the heartache of suddenly \u2018losing\u2019 a pet to dementia. She says: \u2018This is something every animal lover should be aware of. The impact on your pet \u2014 and your own life \u2014 can be devastating.\u2019"}]}

The Prime Minister said he had accepted an invitation from President Hollande to celebrate 'the values behind Charlie Hebdo'. It comes after French commandos simultaneously stormed a grocery store in Paris and printing firm outside the capital where three terrorists were  holed up - killing all the Al Qaeda fanatics. David Cameron will travel to Paris on Sunday to attend a 'unity rally' with other world leaders . The Prime Minister said he had accepted an invitation from President Hollande to celebrate 'the values behind Charlie Hebdo . The 'unity rally' is set to take place at around 3pm on Sunday at the Place de la Republique in central Paris. Mr Cameron and other world leaders will go to the Elysee Palace first, before joining the rally. Mr Cameron's decision to attend the rally on Sunday comes after security chiefs warned that Britain was also being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new \u00a3100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. Warning:\u00a0Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later . The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need . He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' \u2013 but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Armed British police patrol St Pancras station in London, where the Eurostar train runs to Paris . Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria \u2013 about 300 of who are now back home. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.' Patrols stepped up:  Armed British Transport Police officers stand next to the Eurostar platforms at London St Pancras railway station . There is also growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS fights returning to the UK. Radicalisation expert Shiraz Maher this morning told the BBC's Today programme that strict blasphemy laws in Muslim countries abroad were inflaming tensions in the West. He said stricter controls on what could be said about Islam and the prophet Muhammad 'affect some European Muslim's tolerance of satire'. Earlier, the Today programme heard from a number of British Muslims in High Wycombe who expressed anger at the journalists Charlie Hebdo for lampooning Islam. One Pakistani gentleman, Sajjad Haidyer, told the programme that the murdered journalists were 'not innocent'. He said: 'If the people make his cartoons or something else, they are hurting my heart. You can insult the peoples, you can insult me, you can insult anybody else \u2013 but not god, not the prophet Muhammad \u2013 we are not allowing that. 'If they are doing that, that will happen again and again.' He added: 'Some of these people were not innocent. The editor who makes the cartoons. He has no right to make cartoons or the prophet. He has no right to say Islam is bad.' Another elderly Muslim man said: 'Democracy doesn't mean you can go and insult anybody. Insulting somebody, you shouldn't allow that. What are they achieving with the cartoon \u2013 what is the point?' But another man in the town said people did not have the right to take people lives. 'What Islam means is peace, love,' he said. Prince Harry has paid his respects to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre by signing a book of condolence at the French embassy. Harry added his name to a growing list of signatures from leading figures who have expressed sympathy for the 12 people gunned down by attackers who targeted a satirical magazine based in Paris.

A picture shows the message and signature written by Britain's Prince Harry in a book of condolence . Members of the public have been leaving messages of support in another book opened at the French Institute. When Harry first arrived at the embassy in Knightsbridge he was greeted by Sylvie Bermann, France's ambassador to the UK. Ms Bermann ushered him in to a room where the book of condolence was opened on a large table next to colour photographs of all the victims. The table also displayed the slogan Je suis Charlie, adopted worldwide by supporters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and a bouquet of roses left by the London Mayor. Harry, dressed in a suit and tie, wrote the brief message 'With warmest best wishes' above his name. As the prince and the ambassador left the room, they chatted briefly, and in a possible reference to the two Islamist militants suspected of the Charlie Hebdo attack who are holed up in a building outside Paris, Harry said: 'I'm sure it will come to an end soon.' The Queen has already sent a message of condolence to France's president Francois Hollande in which she expressed her 'sincere condolences' to the families of those who were killed in the attack. After the prince left, the ambassador said: 'For us, it's very important to have the support of the Royal Family. 'We were very moved by the support of Her Majesty the Queen and then the prince. It shows the solidarity of the British people and British Government and Royal Family (with us).'"}]}

Vital statistics: A Moorish palace of excellence in Tenerife, set high on the cliffs, the terracotta walls of the Abama shore up the Canary island's most luxurious hotels. Surrounded by extravagant tropical gardens, you'll find nearly 500 suites and rooms amid its shady courtyards. Pristine position: The Abama resort sits in a secluded spot on the west coast of reliably sunny Tenerife . Its cliff-top setting means that you'll be whisked down to the beach by a cable car, but if you want to stay put there are nine swimming pools, including an infinity pool at the cliff's edge that looks out across to the island of La Gomera. The Abama's unabashed luxury continues with two Michelin-starred restaurants. MB comes under the supervision of Martin Berasategui, with classic Spanish cuisine. Kabuki serves Japanese in a sleek red and black interior. Eight others include Le Mirador, which specialises in seafood and has views of the ocean. During school holidays, the bankers of Europe descend en masse with their young children. If you want to escape beautifully dressed eurotots, head to the Tagor villas. The most exclusive (and expensive) of all the Abama's rooms are reserved for over 18s only, with complimentary drinks and snacks. Another refuge for adults is the Abama's 72-par golf course. Considered to be one of Spain's finest, it brings golf-minded celebrities including Bill Clinton to the resort. Recharging her batteries: Penelope Cruz stayed at Abama in July with film-star husband Javier Bardem . Other sports facilities include seven tennis courts - one with seating for 600 people.

Key attraction: Privacy and the sort of luxury you would normally only find in mainland Europe or the Maldives. Reliable short-haul winter sun with Ritz-Carlton finesse (Asprey products in the bathrooms). The hotel's extensive grounds are meticulously kept, and the beach has imported sand because the local stuff was considered to be a bit dark and gritty for the hotel.

That was noteworthy in itself; the Syrian leader doesn't spend much time with the Western media. He was in confident mood -- saying that Syria would not succumb to the unrest then spreading in Tunisia and Egypt. That same month Vogue ran an effusive feature on Syria's first lady, Asma al-Assad, describing her as a \"rose in the desert.\" But in his interview, al-Assad also recognized \"anger and desperation\" in the region and the need for reform in Syria, to \"open up the society,\" as he put it. Change was needed, he said, but \"if you do it just because of what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, then it is going to be a reaction, not an action; and as long as what you are doing is a reaction you are going to fail.\" Now, after 10 days of deadly protests in Syria, that \"reaction\" is well and truly under way. The government has responded with a mixture of aggression and appeasement. It has announced a substantial rise in wages for public employees, and has proposed ending the decades-long state of emergency and opening up Syria's cramped political space to other parties. The current Syrian constitution enshrines the leadership of the Baath Party, which both al-Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have led. At the same time, security forces have swamped Daraa and other towns in the south; witnesses speak of a mysterious group of men dressed in black patrolling the streets of Latakia. Amnesty International reports widespread arrests of political activists. But the protests have continued, and one Facebook page following the unrest -- SyrianRevolution -- now has nearly 100,000 followers. The regime's carrot-and-stick approach may work in the short term but the widely respected International Crisis Group says President Assad has two starkly different options. \"One involves an immediate and inevitably risky political initiative that might convince the Syrian people that the regime is willing to undertake dramatic change. The other entails escalating repression, which has every chance of leading to a bloody and ignominious end. \" While it has tinkered with reform over the past 10 years, al-Assad's government is hamstrung by internal disagreement, endemic corruption and competing goals at home and in the region. That at least is the picture that emerges from analyzing the U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. The cables acknowledge that al-Assad has allowed greater media freedom since he became president 11 years ago \"with Al Jazeera, the local favorite, and al-Arabiya readily available via satellite.\" Local journalists spoke of shifting red lines, adding wryly that \"it was much simpler under Hafez al-Assad; we always knew where the red lines were.\" Caution has been the watchword in other spheres, including a tentative \"reset\" of Syria's frosty relationship with the United States since President Barack Obama took office and a gradual reassertion of Syria's role in Lebanon. The younger al-Assad has blamed a rough neighborhood for slow progress at home. \"We are not the only captain,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. \"We were affected by the situation in Iraq or in Lebanon. There are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in 2012.\" The cables shed light on how Syria has been run -- with powerful and often competing cliques dominating economic and political life, and intrigue trumping open debate. Part of the diplomatic traffic is devoted to the power of \"regime financiers\" like telecom magnate Rami Makhluf, al-Assad's cousin. A U.S. contact is quoted in a cable as saying \"most Syrians viewed Rami in a negative light and his strong-arm business tactics had earned him many enemies.\" The same cable says corruption \"was rife in Syrian government and society and had undermined the president's credibility with the Syrian people.\" There is also evidence of serious rifts within the security apparatus, with one cable from 2008 reporting that \"Syrian Military Intelligence and General Intelligence Directorate officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security\" that occurred in Damascus when Hezbollah's military commander, Imad Mughniyah, was killed by a car bomb. Several months later, a top adviser to al-Assad -- Gen. Mohammed Suleiman -- was shot dead at his vacation home on the Syrian coast. His killers have never been identified, although the Syrians blame Israel. Syria's long-term alliance with Iran and its sponsorship of the Hezbollah militia in neighboring Lebanon are also sensitive issues at home. Some reports from Daraa say protesters have raised their voices against both. Syrian officials quoted in U.S. cables say Hezbollah is a legitimate resistance movement and part of the overall Middle East peace process. In other words -- Syria's (and Iran's) insurance card against Israel. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus sharply criticized Syria's alleged delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah. \"Syria's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hezbollah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region,\" he wrote. Other cables suggest constant juggling by al-Assad as he tries to keep the alliance with Iran intact while not closing the door to negotiations with Israel. Fawaz Gerges at the London School of Economics says Syria is a critical regional player. \"Instability in Syria means there will be instability in Lebanon, which is a divided country along sectarian lines.\" Iran, too, would be affected were Assad to go, he said: \"Syria is a critical player that supports a non-Arab state. The West has tried to wean Syria off Iran but has failed.\" Barak Seener, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute in London, agrees that events in Syria could alter the Middle East landscape. \"A liberal democratic Syria would be more susceptible to peace with Israel, irrespective of the status of the Golan Heights,\" he said. \"In light of the opposition that removed Mubarak, it is questionable whether peace can be made with autocratic leaders that can be removed and not with liberal societies.\" Seener says the violence so far does not threaten the regime's existence but \"will embolden the majority-Sunni population and Kurdish minority, who deeply resent the political dominance of the Alawi minority, to protest.\" Al-Assad is an Alawite. But so far, none of Syria's major cities has seen the sort of unrest witnessed in Daraa. Some Syria-watchers say al-Assad may even turn the crisis to his advantage by pushing through reform despite the hardliners and bureaucratic inertia. He may also benefit from a fractured opposition. Syrian analyst Murhaf Jouejati at George Washington University says that civil society has been stifled by decades of emergency rule. \"The protesters are not organized. The opposition is fragmented,\" he said. \"Civil society is not developed enough to be a counterweight to the state\" even if intellectuals leading the opposition enjoy a certain amount of moral authority. Other analysts say the sudden announcement of extensive concessions smacks of panic, and that endemic corruption and high unemployment are beyond the government's capacity to fix. In addition, as the International Crisis Group notes, \"as a result of events elsewhere in the region, a new awareness and audacity have materialized over the past several weeks in myriad forms of rebelliousness.\" Fear, if not gone, is no longer so pervasive. The International Crisis Group says much hinges on al-Assad, who is due to address the nation in the next couple of days. \"He alone can prove that change is possible and already in the making, restore some sense of clarity and direction to a bewildered power apparatus and put forward a detailed framework for structural change,\" it says. As al-Assad also told the Wall Street Journal in January: \"This is the Middle East, where every week you have something new.\""}]}

Monks from the Greek Orthodox and Armenian denominations were preparing for a ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City when a disagreement led to a full-fledged fistfight.

The Greek members of the clergy wanted one of their monks present, the AP reported, for fear that the procession would undermine their claim to an ancient structure built on what is believed to be the tomb of Jesus. The two sides could not agree, and when the Armenians tried to begin the procession, the Greek monks stepped in and the fighting began, the AP reported. \"We were keeping resistance so that the procession could not pass through ... and establish a right that they don't have,\" a young Greek Orthodox monk with a cut next to his left eye told the AP.

Liverpool is the whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show huge regional variations in case rates \u2013 clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts. Whiplash claims cost insurers\u00a0 \u00a32billion a year, with bogus payouts adding \u00a390 to the typical car insurance premium. Whiplash: Bogus claims cost the insurance industry \u00a32\u00bfbillion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by \u00a390 . In the 12 months to March, the number of cases in Liverpool was 22 per thousand residents. Uxbridge in West London and Oldham were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand. Those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas. The lowest rates were in Scotland, where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases. A survey of GPs last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are \u2018fake or over-diagnosed\u2019. At least 30,000 \u2013 6 per cent \u2013 are outright fraudulent, according to the Insurance Fraud Bureau.UK insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day, twice the level in other European countries. Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers, said: \u2018This is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made. \u2018And there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims. \u2018Whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down. \u2018Either we have developed the weakest necks in Europe or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected.\u2019 Aviva has called for a radical overhaul of the system, saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims. Dominic Clayden, claims director for the insurer, said: \u2018We operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to \u201chave a go\u201d \u2013 there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought. 'However, this \u201cwhip-cash\u201d is not free. It is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years. \u2018The UK needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve, but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums. Crackdown: The nationwide issue was brought to light by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke who has held a 'Whiplash Summit' in Parliament in a bid to crack down on the crooks . \u2018The Ministry of Justice needs to increase the small claims limit to \u00a35,000, meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers. We also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped.\u2019 But John Spencer, of personal injury specialist Spencer\u2019s Solicitors, said: \u2018There are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that. \u2018But you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated.\u2019 Last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: \u2018Car insurance costs are simply too high, they must be reduced. \u2018The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims. \u2018But we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the Government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down.\u2019 Whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly, damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck \u2013 a common injury in a car accident.

McDowell played his first 12 holes in seven under par at Sheshan International but dropped two shots in the last six to card an opening 67 in the second event of the European Tour's Final Series. Starting from the 10th, the Ryder Cup star birdied his opening hole and picked up further shots on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th to race to the turn in 31, before birdies at the second and third took him well clear of a star-studded field featuring 40 of the world's top 50. Former US Open winner Graeme McDowell set the clubhouse target in the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai but could have been further ahead but for a poor back nine . McDowell takes a 'selfie' with three local fans as he competes in Shanghai . Ulsterman McDowell talks to caddie Ken Comboy on the fifth hole and the Sheshan International Golf Club . However, the former US Open champion dropped his first shot of the day on the fourth and paid the price for missing his only fairway of the round on the 603-yard eighth hole, a par-five which had so far given up just two birdies. At five under par, McDowell enjoyed a two-shot lead over Ryder Cup opponent Rickie Fowler and fellow American Chris Kirk, who were approaching the end of their rounds, with Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter safely in the clubhouse on two under. American Dustin Johnson claimed the title 12 months ago with a winning total of 24 under par, but Justin Rose - who was fifth last year - had correctly predicted heavier rough and firmer greens would make scoring more difficult.

Ian Poulter watches his shot after teeing off on the fourth hole during the first round . Rose, who was fourth in the BMW Masters on Sunday, was level par after 13 holes, while the winner at Lake Malaren - Germany's Marcel Siem - was one over with three to play. Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, who took 13 on the ninth hole during his final round last week, struggled to an opening 78, while FedEx Cup winner Billy Horschel managed just one birdie in a round of 80. Fowler and Kirk duly completed rounds of 69 and were soon joined on three under by the likes of Brandt Snedeker, Tim Clark, 2011 winner Martin Kaymer and England's Tommy Fleetwood. Henrik Stenson looked set to expand that group still further but twice found sand on the ninth - his final hole - and almost thinned his third shot across the green and into the water. The resulting bogey left Stenson alongside Westwood and Poulter on two under, with world number two Adam Scott also completing an opening round of 70."}]}

Shawn R. Glans was charged with official misconduct and second-degree harassment, said Saratoga County Sheriff Michael H. Zurlo. Glans, who resigned from the force, was released on his own recognizance, Zurlo said. The video shows the deputy cursing at the man, who repeatedly tells the officer there's no reason to search the vehicle. \"I wasn't in my car when all this was happening,\" the man says. \"Why don't you want to search like my house or something?\" \"Let me see your f***ing keys,\" the deputy fires back. The video shows the deputy approaching the man. \"You want to f***ing resist?\" the deputy says. \"I'm not resisting,\" the man says. Then there's the sound of a slap. The video, which has been viewed thousands of times on YouTube, doesn't show the source of the sound. The man who says he recorded the video told CNN affiliate WTEN that the officer hit the man. \"He gave him a good whack on the back of the head, and after that he got the keys,\" the man said. \"I just thought it was really wrong, the way he went about it.\" The deputy also had harsh words apparently aimed at the man recording the video, telling him, \"I'll rip your f***ing head off.\" The press release from the sheriff said: \"The actions of Sergeant Glans both as a police officer and a supervisor were completely inappropriate and unwarranted and not condoned in any fashion by the Saratoga County Sheriff's Office.

Leyrtiz had faced up to six months in jail after his November conviction for driving under the influence, but he was spared the prospect of up to 15 years in prison when jurors acquitted him of DUI manslaughter. \"I am telling you now that if you violate probation, I will give you the maximum jail sentence,\" Broward County Circuit Judge Marc Gold told Leyritz on Thursday. Leyritz was convicted of driving drunk in the December 2007 accident that killed 30-year-old Freida Veitch. The wreck occurred after he had spent his 44th birthday with friends in Fort Lauderdale bars, and tests after the accident indicated he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.14 percent -- well above Florida's legal limit of 0.08. \"That night -- my birthday -- and every year, I will remember that night, your honor,\" a tearful Leyritz told the judge. Leyritz played most of his 11-season major-league career with the Yankees, hitting a clutch home run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series that helped propel New York to the championship. He also played with the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series against the Yankees. Prosecutors had argued for four months jail time in addition to a year of probation, but defense attorney David Bogenschutz argued that the offense was the first for Leyritz. Gold also imposed a $500 fine, the state's maximum, and revoked Leyritz's drivers license for six months. The victim's husband, Jordan Veitch, said Leyritch's conduct \"shows a lack of respect or the lives of others.\" Freida Veitch also was drunk -- with a 0.18 blood alcohol level -- and was not wearing her seat belt, according to court documents. Jordan Veitch acknowledged that his wife could have faced charges had she survived, but, \"She did not have an opportunity to be judged.\" \"Mr. Leyritz will be able to kiss and hug his children again. He will be able to go on being a parent,\" Jordan Veitch said. \"Frieda will never have that chance to do any of these things again.\""}]}

Police officers were investigating a reported marijuana-growing operation when they discovered a homemade bomb and bomb-making materials in a suitcase, the news release said. Vladislav Miftakhov, a Russian citizen, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe and drug-related offenses. He was arraigned Friday and bail was set at $500,000, Blair County corrections officer James McMahon said Sunday. According to a criminal complaint, police found one pound of atomized magnesium and one pound of Chinese potassium perchlorate along with a package labeled potassium nitrate powder. They also found fuses and several containers of compressed air. When asked what he was going to do with two devices that were found with exposed fuses, Miftakhov said \"he was going to blow things up,\" the complaint alleges. Miftakhov later said he only intended to set devices off in a field and wasn't going to blow anything up, the document says. He told police that he had previously experimented with other homemade explosives in California. Authorities found five marijuana seedlings and a grow light, the complaint says. Miftakhov will next appear in court on February 5. He will be assigned a public defender, McMahon said. The Pennsylvania State Police bomb squad \"safely deconstructed\" the device, officials said. According to the release, Miftakhov told officers that he had purchased materials for the bomb on the Internet. A man who lived in the same building told CNN affiliate WTAJ that Miftakhov was \"the weirdest individual that I've ever met,\" but Andrew Leff added that he didn't think Miftakhov had done anything dangerous before. Leff told the Altoona Mirror, which identified him as an apartment-mate, that Miftakhov had recently set off three small homemade bombs outside the apartment, leaving small craters in the ground. Another roommate, Steven Taylor, said Miftakhov was quiet. \"He barely talked,\" he told the newspaper. An independent student newspaper said the Russian native is a student at Penn State Altoona, a branch of the university about 40 miles from the main campus. The Altoona campus has about 3,645 full-time students, according to the school's website. Austin bomb an amateur job or something more insidious?

A neglected dog has been put down by a vet who described it as suffering with the worst case of starvation he had ever seen. Fly, a 15-year-old lurcher, lost half her body weight, down to only 8.1kg, and shocked vets with her horrendous condition. The dog's owner, David Lowe, 33, was summoned to appear at Bolton Magistrates' Court, to face charges of animal cruelty, on February 24, but failed to turn up. However, the case was proved in his absence and he was convicted of five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in October 2013. His sentencing, held yesterday, has been postponed while further reports are put together for the court. Warning: Graphic content . Vets and RSPCA workers described Fly as suffering with the worst case of starvation they had ever seen . Fly, left, was so starved vets had to put her down. Her owner, David Lowe, has been described as 'vulnerable' The dog was discovered by the RSPCA at Lowe's Farnworth home in October 2013 after a tip-off from a concerned member of the public. When Fly was found, she was suffering from an abscess in its mouth, overgrown nails, a severe dental disease and had discharge oozing from a sinus beneath its eye. Vets later found that Fly also had a mammary tumour and was diabetic. The RSPCA took custody of Fly that same day but, after examination, vets decided the most humane course of action was to put the dog down. RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said: 'Fly was the thinnest dog I or the vet had ever seen. 'She was in such a terrible state, with so many issues, that the vet took the difficult decision to put her to sleep there and then. Of course we would have loved her to have recovered, but this was the kindest thing to do. 'At 15 years old she was an elderly dog but she was not in this condition because of her age, she was in this condition because she had been badly neglected.' The court heard how Lowe had been given \u00a320 to take the dog to the vets for treatment but failed to do so, fearing she would be put down. The dog could have been 'easily . treated' if help had been sought earlier, the court heard, but she was . put down after being found in a 'severely emaciated condition'. Fly could have been 'easily treated' if taken to a vet sooner but had deteriorated so much nothing could be done . Fly had been starved down to weighing only 8.1kg, half of what a healthy 15-year-old lurcher should weigh . When the RSPCA found Fly in October 2013, she was suffering from a number of problems, including an abscess in her mouth, overgrown nails, dental disease, a sinus beneath her eye, left, diabetes and a tumour . Tony . Stock, prosecuting, said: 'Angus McKenzie, a vet with more than 30 . years\u2019 experience, said this was one of the most severely emaciated dogs . - dead or alive - he had seen in 30 years. 'The . dog weighed 8.1kg - less than half its ideal weight - and scored zero . in a body condition scale where one is emaciated and five is grossly . obese.' Adam Whittaker, defending, said Lowe . had been homeless for four years and his ex-partner was caring for the . dog until returning it to him last year. Lowe was, who Mr Whittaker described as 'highly vulnerable', was said to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder following an explosion in Raikes Lane, Burnden.

A former teacher has revealed how she leapt from a cliff edge to save her 19-month-old son after he fell over the side as they chased butterflies. Melanie Liu feared the worst when she saw her youngest son Eli slip off the edge as they enjoyed a picnic at a beauty spot in Whitby, North Yorkshire. The cliff has a drop of some 65 feet to a concrete car park, but luckily Eli was unhurt because he landed in a bush about 15 feet down. Safe and sound: Melanie Liu hugs her 19-month-old son Eli (left) after he survived falling off a cliff at Spion Kop in Whitby by landing in a bush (right) Ms Liu jumped down to him, breaking her fall slightly by grabbing grass and digging her nails into the cliff face. Ms Liu, 39, who runs a guest house with her husband Bill, 44, said the incident happened on Spion Kop in Whitby last Saturday. She said they had been following butterflies with her little lad at what she thought was a safe distance. But the thick grass and vegetation at the spot made it seem to her that they were two feet from the edge, when in fact they were much closer. Ms Liu, a mother of two, said she had a firm hand on the hood of Eli\u2019s jacket but as the child took one more step towards the edge - a distance she thought was too close - he disappeared over the side. 'It was just the worst moment of my life, he somersaulted twice and landed on a shrub about 15 feet down,' she said. 'As he dropped I jumped, you just don\u2019t think about it at the time. It was a maternal instinct. 'They say your whole life flashes before your eyes but it was his death that flashed before mine, I was afraid of what I would see when I found him. 'I know what was at the bottom of that cliff. It was a terrifying moment.' She said she stopped beside her son, who had started crying as soon as he landed in the bush.

Despite wearing four-inch high-heeled boots, Ms Liu was able to bring Eli back to the top after a few minutes. 'Once we got to the top we lay down for a long time,' she said. 'After 10 minutes he was fine but I was in shock and started being sick and shaking. My heart was hammering. 'It was around five minutes from when Eli fell until I got him back to safety but it seemed like hours. 'There are only one or two of those shrubs on the side of the cliff. It is so lucky that he landed on one. 'As soon as Eli fell I started screaming and was still screaming when I jumped over the side but I hadn\u2019t realised it. 'A man had been watching on another cliff and ran to get round to us. He told me that he had heard a bloodcurdling scream. 'I was bit incoherent but but he calmed me down.' Ms Liu said the man who helped her was called Tom and lived in Somerset but she had no more details. She warned other people to take care at the cliff edge but said the grass should remain overgrown for the wildlife. She said: 'I never once let go of him and thought nothing would happen but the edge is much closer than you think. 'It took me ages to get home. I kept being sick and bursting into tears on the way. 'I won\u2019t be going near a cliff edge again with children, no way. 'I consider myself to be a safety-conscious mum, but look what happened.'

Reclusive North Korea has often issued threats to attack the South and the United States but has rarely turned them into action. Such hostile rhetoric is widely seen as a means to perpetuate its domestic and international political agenda. In March this year, the North declared it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War signed with the United States and China, threatening to use nuclear weapons to attack U.S. and South Korean territories. The North has defied international warnings not to build nuclear and long-range missiles and is believed to have enough fissile material to build up to 10 nuclear bombs.

In the end, the question, both legal and moral, often boils down to who should have the burden of proof: Should states be forced to show their laws are justified because they prevent demonstrable fraud or should opponents be forced to show that the law prevents large numbers of people from voting? Voter ID cases often pit an invisible plaintiff against an imaginary problem.  It is difficult to find voters who absolutely cannot vote because of an ID law, just as it is challenging to find instances of the type of fraud such laws intend to prevent. The plaintiffs are invisible because very few people have the means to bring the federal case to challenge such laws but don't have the ability to navigate the barriers at the Department of Motor Vehicles to get an actual ID. Also, although we do know about 10% of Americans might not have the ID necessary to vote, we don't know how many won't vote specifically because of this extra burden, how many will be motivated to get an ID or how many will resort to absentee ballots, which do not require ID. In the Pennsylvania case, the lawyers had the perfect plaintiff, Viviette Applewhite, a 93-year-old, wheelchair-bound African-American woman who had no driver's license and no birth certificate because she was born at home. For such people, getting the required documents can be burdensome and sometimes expensive.  For Applewhite, unlike most of us, exercising her right to vote was worth the fight in court. (Did I mention she also marched with Martin Luther King Jr.?)  It also turned out that once she lost her case, she was able and willing to get through the bureaucratic maze necessary to get her ID. The moral of the story:  If you are one of those people who considers voting a right worth dying for, you'll most likely be able to do what is necessary to get to vote.  Such is not the case, however, if you are one of the unfortunate few who can never get the right documents you need. Or if you're one of the great many nonvoters for whom any additional hindrance makes you think it's not worth it -- that the added costs of registering and voting exceed the intangible benefit of knowing you have participated in the democracy. Even after an election takes place, another reason makes plaintiffs difficult to find and the effect of voter ID laws uncertain: It's unclear whether the laws are actually enforced as intended.  For any number of election regulations, there's a huge gap between the law on the books and the practices in the polling place. When the poll worker's neighbor shows up without an ID, the odds are that she might let him vote anyway -- that is, assuming he has been neighborly.  Of course, that might not happen if she doesn't recognize him or she has trouble understanding his accent. Indeed, political scientists find that huge numbers of voters in states even without ID laws report being asked for photo ID on Election Day.  And at least one election administrator in Pennsylvania has even pledged not to enforce the new law. Against the invisible plaintiffs in these cases is the imaginary problem of voter impersonation fraud -- the kind of fraud where someone goes to the polling place and votes using the name of someone else. Even though we have few documented cases and prosecutions, make no mistake about it:  Voter impersonation does happen.  It probably happens with the same frequency as voters collapsing in line while waiting to vote, or getting nauseous when they see the names on the ballot.  And yes, if every election were to be a replay of the 2000 election, then any mishap -- fraudulent or otherwise -- could determine the outcome.  As of yet, however, we have not required all polling places to be prepared with smelling salts. The reason voter impersonation fraud is so rare is that it is an incredibly stupid and inefficient way to rig an election. Shepherding hordes of fraudsters from one polling place to the next to vote in other people's names would take a lot of time and effort and expose them to trouble with the law with little potential payoff.  Successful fraud  is usually perpetrated at the wholesale, rather than retail, level. Absentee ballots, in particular, have proven to be the fraudster's method of choice.  They are cast in private out of the view of suspecting eyes of poll workers or fellow voters.  They are ripe for coercion and undue influence from whoever might be sitting next to the absentee voter -- think union or corporate bosses.  And multiple ballots can be collected over the course of several weeks, saving the expense and rush of a one-day voter impersonation campaign. The greatest irony of the new crop of voter ID laws is that they do nothing to combat the more frequent problem of absentee ballot fraud. In fact, they might even make such fraud more likely because the number of absentee voters might increase, given that absentee voters do not need to have a photo ID in order to vote.  Worse still, absentee votes are much more likely to be otherwise disqualified because of errors committed by either the voter or the vote counter. They present the perfect storm of fraud and mistakes that conjures up images of the cockeyed Florida vote counters in the 2000 election. I happen to be in the camp that believes a state should provide a compelling justification for new election laws even if they have an admittedly uncertain effect on voters' rights.  But you do not need to be a fellow traveler or even to be preoccupied with voting rights to worry about the implications of these laws. Enforcement of these laws will be spotty.  They will cause confusion in the polling place as relatively untrained, volunteer poll workers come up to speed with sometimes complicated new regulations.  Some voters will choose not to vote, while others will cast provisional ballots -- so-called because the legality of the vote will be determined after Election Day if the voter can come up with ID in time for the ballot to be counted. This will all be done in the name of preventing voter fraud. Yet if these laws lead unwittingly to an increase in the number of voters casting absentee votes out of public view, then they will not even have addressed the fraud they intend to solve.  Indeed, they might even make it worse. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter ."}]}

A conman plunged a kitchen knife into his housemate's neck  at his luxury Mayfair apartment before screaming 'you're going to die' as the alleged victim begged for mercy, the Old Bailey has heard. Darren Scott, 26, allegedly slashed the man's throat midway through a friendly massage, before stabbing him repeatedly\u00a0in a scene 'straight out of a horror movie'. The victim, a writer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - managed to break free from the frenzied attack and lock himself in the bathroom, while blood was gushing from his wounds, the court was told. He then banged on the door shouting 'murder', before pleading with Scott to call an ambulance. But Scott screamed \u2018you\u2019re going to die\u2019 before throwing a chair at the bathroom door and trying to kick his way through, the court heard. Scott, who had moved into the plush London flat just two weeks earlier, was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull. The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the \u00a3280 train fare. Prosecutor John Clifford told the Old Bailey how the alleged victim had feared Scott was a \u2018psychopath\u2019 due to his 'big, staring eyes'. But he had still allowed him to move into his flat, just one day after they had met online, in July last year. After he had moved in, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told. But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. Another document showed a \u00a3420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told. Scott also allegedly used his new friend\u2019s bank card to pay for the train trip to Hull, as well as to go on a \u00a31,700 spending spree at House of Fraser. The court was told how the alleged incident unfolded after Scott offered to give his new friend a massage at around 9am on July 3 last year. Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a t-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to \u2018quite loud and angry\u2019 sounds. Mr Clifford told the court: \u2018It was then that (he) became aware that Mr Scott began tapping, trying to find a vein in his neck\u2019. 'The next thing he was aware of, he had been stabbed without warning by Mr Scott in the neck. \u2018Immediately he tried to get up using his arms to protect himself from the blows of the knife which continue to rain down upon him.\u2019 Scott, of no fixed address, is on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) and denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud . Mr Clifford said the victim struggled free and locked himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. He said: \u2018At this stage, he had blood quite literally gushing from his wounds, over the door to the bedroom, over the floor, over the inside of the shower - it was something you would only expect to see in a horror movie. \u2018Having managed to get inside the en-suite bathroom, he became aware of a loud crashing sound as if something had been thrown against the door. \u2018He was in a state of panic with blood gushing from his wounds to the neck, to the nine stab wounds to the upper part of his body, to the 12 other injuries to his arms and hands, banged on the bathroom wall, crying \u201cmurder\u201d repeatedly. \u2018Alas, these cries were not answered by anyone at all. During this time, Mr Scott was just outside the door screaming: \u201cYou\u2019re going to die\u201d.\u2019 Mr Clifford said the trapped victim tried to reason with Scott, but the knifeman instead broke down crying and refused to call for help. He then said something 'very significant', Mr Clifford told the court. \u2018He said: \u201cIf you die, then I will get life, but if you live then I\u2019ll only get 14 years\",' he said. \u2018That was a very chilling and sinister remark to make, something which you may think says a lot about Mr Scott\u2019s state of mind on that day.\u2019 In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Scott told his friends he had been attacked by potential investors who had pulled out a knife. He took a train to Brough near Hull to stay with a friend, but was arrested the next day while socialising in a jazz bar in the town. After his arrest, detectives unravelled a web of deception that Scott had left in his wake, the court was told. Mr Clifford said the victim had \u2018thought Scott was a psychopath' after they had been living together for just a few days, but dismissed the thought because he was \u2018intrigued by Scott\u2019. \u2018It was during this time that Mr Scott was in effect ingratiating himself to (his victim), and indeed was not only using his bank cards but was taking pictures of the flat, a well-appointed flat on three floors in Mayfair, sending it to his friends, and in effect saying look at my new place, look at how well I\u2019ve done for myself,' Mr Clifford told the court. 'That\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg with regards to the deception carried out by Mr Scott.\u2019 Mr Clifford said Scott had a forged job offer from Procter and Gamble and a bogus letter from the courts service saying he had been given \u00a3420,000 in compensation. The jury also heard Scott had been \u2018helping himself\u2019 to his alleged victim's bank cards. \u2018It is alleged that Mr Scott abused his bank card to purchase train tickets, first class, from London back to Hull where his parents lived at a cost of \u00a3280.50\u2019, he said. \u2018Mr Scott has pleaded guilty to using a House of Fraser bank card to make purchases in the order of \u00a31700.\u2019 He also had a set of keys with the address of another Mayfair flat written on the fob, the court heard. Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud. He has admitted a second count of fraud over the House of Fraser shopping . The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}]}

Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out. The winning bidder, who went by the online name of 'gorpetri,' failed to make good on the deal, which led New York City Housing Works thrift shop desperate for another taker. The original painting featuring a serene landscape was purchased from Housing Works a few months ago. It was then returned with the addition of a Nazi officer sitting on a bench, taking in the scene with Banksy's signature in the corner. After discovering the artist behind . their latest acquisition, the thrift shop, which benefits the homeless . and those suffering from HIV/AIDs, decided to sell the painting,'The Banality of the Banality of Evil,' at . an auction. Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. Housing Works immediately went in search of another taker. According to Gawker the thrift store contacted the next highest bidder, who refused to pay a . bid that had been placed in competition with a fraud.' Other bidders wondered if 'gorpetri' was actually the elusive British graffiti artist playing another prank to drive up prices. They also started to complain that Housing Works was not telling the truth about how the painting made it's way to their store. People gather outside the Housing Works Thrift Shop on 23rd Street in New York City to get a glimpse of Banksy's painting - 'The Banality of the Banality of Evil.' Wil Emlingman, from Minneapolis who bid on behalf of a private buyer, told TPM that he is suspicious of Housing Works. 'They were in on it all along. They knew. Actually, Banksy's people actually contacted them saying, 'Hey, we're looking for a landscape piece, we want to paint a monster on it,' Emling said. 'So the whole story about somebody buying it weeks ago and then somebody coming and dropping it off and telling them, 'I need to speak with the manager, you have a very expensive piece on your hands here,' isn't the case.' But Housing Works and Banksy's PR team deny all of the claims. A spokesperson from Housing Works said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the 'vandalized' painting last month. 'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post. The thrift store was able to eventually find a buyer. They sold the painting to an anonymous individual who paid 'at least $450,000,' according to Gawker. Before the auction, Housing Works hung the painting in their store on 23rd Street. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. 'It was one of the largest gifts Housing Works has ever received and we're thrilled,' Housing Work's chief development officer, Matthew Bernardo, told TPM. 'We're thankful that he chose us as an emblem of New York to give his donation to.' The charity donation marked the conclusion of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month of October. Banksy ended his month-long residency on the streets of New York with an inflatable tag on the Long Island Expressway in Queens. The last piece from Better Out Than In sits above other tags in a used car lot. Cops took down the balloons. One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to 'police activity'. The philanthropic turn came after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is replacing The World Trade Center. His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water with New Yorkers."}]}

The 58-year-old recently trailed Jay-Z for an upcoming documentary he's directing about the rapper's role in the Budweiser Made in America Festival due out in 2013; he's mentoring James Murphy on his first directorial project; and he'll soon return as the narrator of the upcoming season of \"Arrested Development.\" Says Howard of the comedy series' new season, \"It's hilarious and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters, and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments.\" So did you have fun hanging out with Jay-Z? I really did. The whole thing was interesting for me. I've never interviewed anybody, first of all. I'm pretty good at the initial instincts, and the very first time that I met [Jay-Z] some months back, we met with him in his office and there was just something that I really respected about him. I think he's pretty true to himself and pretty clear about what he thinks. Kind of the opposite of mercurial, I'd say. I don't know what the opposite of mercurial is, but he's I think tremendously focused. I've been around a lot of artists who are also good at business and . . . one minute they'll sound like an artist and the next minute they'll sound like the characters in \"Mad Men.\" Jay-Z's a very good businessman and he talks about it and enjoys it, but he doesn't shift. He has a sense of what he thinks people might appreciate, because he sort of trusts that if he appreciates it, there are people out there who will as well. And that's what's interesting to me: that he's accomplished in those areas but I don't hear that sort of cynical, world-weary quality. Jay-Z Gets Assist From Kanye at Made in America . And when he's onstage, the confidence he has with the microphone is pretty amazing. I got to watch in the pit, right on the edge on the stage. I understood something that I never even really had thought about before. He really communicates, whereas I think some of the other hip hop artists -- they were great performers and they were dynamic and charismatic -- but on a consistent basis, every idea seemed to be a communication. I always thought that about Sinatra. It's a connection. It's a story they're telling you. And I was kind of knocked out by that. I've never seen Eminem live, but in our movie, 8 Mile, I felt like that was happening. You interviewed Odd Future. What was that like? I like their videos. I'm laughing one minute, then my jaw drops the next. But I think they're so wild and great and I really like them. [Tyler, the Creator] and I just started talking and he just kept looking at me kind of like squinting and saying, \"You're sick. You're sick.\" [Laughs] I kind of knew it was a compliment, but I was joking later and said, \"I thought I looked fine!\" I was trying to describe them to somebody. It's kind of like there's the Marx Brothers and National Lampoon . . . this group chaos thing. It's pretty exciting to see that brand of anarchy and self expression adding up to so much. Jay-Z, actually, was really interested in them. He said to me that he, you know, Roc Nation, wanted to sign them and they went down the road discussing it, but ultimately Odd Future didn't want to be signed. They wanted to be self-reliant, self -contained. Were there any highlights from the festival? I think getting to talk to D'Angelo. Photos: Live at Made in America 2012 . That's a very rare interview. Yeah, and I don't think he's done very many. I wouldn't characterize it as probing, but, because it was on the subject of the event, I was glad to be able to share with him what I was hearing from everybody -- which is that everyone was so impressed with his reemergence and a kind of new level of musicianship. I heard that from several people. And I passed that along to him, so more than sort of the interview I was glad to be able to communicate that to him, and he was, I think, flattered to hear that. But you know, he's really focused and hard at it, and I think he's really glad to be out there. It was also fun to see Run-DMC. I talked to them both and they barely rehearsed. I remembered that when Henry Winkler and I, four years ago, did this Funny or Die sketch for Obama. It was so funny, because I was wearing this hair piece, Henry was wearing kind of Fonzie wig and we fell into it and I swear to God, I honestly d\u00c3\u00a9ja v\u00c3\u00bb'ed and thought I was back in the Arnold's parking lot doing a scene. It was so easy. So when I saw those guys, they just nailed it. I just thought, \"Well, yeah, you know, sometimes when a thing becomes a part of a fabric of your life, your history, that doesn't get so rusty.\" When you were younger, because of Happy Days and American Graffiti, people associated you with music of the Fifties and early Sixties. What do you listen to? I've never been much of a consumer and we didn't listen to much music in the home except kind of at Christmas time, so it was all Bing [Crosby] and Nat King Cole and the Everly Brothers. But it never became a passion. I didn't really listen to music when I was doing homework or when I when I work on a script. I tend to drift to NPR and news. It's interesting that you're working with James Murphy, too. Oh, yeah. My kids are grown, and I feel that I can afford the time to just be a little, you know, a little more experimental about what I do with my time away from the movies and the TV shows, which are still my main drive. James Murphy just came through this project, Canon's Imagination. This is year two of that, and last year we did it and my daughter Bryce directed the film, and people send in pictures targeting their own photographs for certain narrative categories. And then the public votes and they narrow it down to 10, and last year I chose one from each category and handed it over to Bryce and she had to direct a movie. And it was successful. It was a great creative experiment. With James Murphy, we wanted somebody from the music world, and of course he's so creative and visual and a really talented and intelligent guy. So I'm actually dying to see what he does with this exercise. I think I'm going to be inspired by him. Theoretically, I'm supposed to be offering some guidance and support, but I think he's one of the ones I'm sort of most curious about seeing work with this whole program. Would you ever work with Jay-Z again? I would do a documentary about Jay-Z. Yes, I would. I mean, that's not what this is particularly, but he's central to it. But if I had a chance and I thought I could do it justice, you know, I think he's a great subject. He's a great subject. Definitely. How is it going with \"Arrested Development\"? It's going great. There's a really good article that somebody did, an interview with Mitch Hurwitz. It's pretty funny. It's hilarious, and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments that are, you know, a brand new sort of five-alarm fires or however many alarms, whatever the maximum number of alarms is. I should remember that from \"Backdraft,\" but I don't. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Rolling Stone."}]}

Dressed in matching green uniforms, they were also helping to remind class teachers who was who. Many multiple births are a happy surprise but experts say numbers are increasing because of the rise in infertility treatments and the fact women are leaving it later to have children. In 2012 there were 11,228 sets of twins born in England and Wales, compared to 8,776 in 1998. About one in every 64 births in the UK today is twins, triplets or more. Jane Denton, director of the Multiple Births Foundation, based at London\u2019s Hammersmith Hospital, said: \u2018In recent years and because of infertility treatments, the number of twins born has been rising.\u2019 She supported the policy adopted by many schools to try to separate twins if possible. \u2018Each twin relationship should be looked at to see what suits the children best but being in separate classes can bring huge benefits,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s important for teachers, friends and everybody to see them as individuals.\u2019"}]}

Controversial: Former Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell recruited his ex-colleague within weeks of arriving at the BBC . A former Labour Cabinet Minister hired by the BBC on a \u00a3295,000-a-year salary is spending thousands of pounds a week employing an outside consultant he used to work with. James Purnell, who resigned from Government in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown, joined the Corporation as a director in March. The Mail on Sunday has learned that within weeks of his arrival he recruited 34-year-old ex-colleague Jean-Paul Petranca. Mr Purnell and Mr Petranca worked together at Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy,\u00a0 as recently as January. Last night the appointment was criticised by Conservative MP Alun Cairns, who said it raised serious questions about the BBC\u2019s employment practices. Neither the BBC nor Mr Petranca\u2019s company was willing to discuss the nature of his work for Mr Purnell, which is believed to be coming to an end after six months. But one insider estimated that the BBC has been paying the consultancy firm, which describes itself as the world\u2019s leading adviser on business strategy, about \u00a314,000 a week. Mr Cairns said: \u2018This sort of situation undermines recent commitments made by the BBC to be more transparent. There have already been questions about the manner of James Purnell\u2019s own appointment. \u2018For us to find out that he secretly recruited someone from his former company gives the BBC a bad name and raises further doubts about its openness and transparency.\u2019 Battle: Mr Purnell resigned in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown . The news of Mr Petranca\u2019s BBC work comes weeks after it was revealed Mr Purnell had recruited another ex-colleague. Godric Smith, 48, one of Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctors, is being paid \u00a3150,000 a year by the Corporation as a part-time PR adviser. The appointment infuriated Tory MPs as the BBC already has 140 staff in its PR department, with a salary bill of around \u00a35\u2009million. Mr Smith was hired to help restore the BBC\u2019s reputation after the scandal over Jimmy Savile and a \u00a325\u2009million redundancy bill for senior managers.

He is already the BBC\u2019s highest paid star. Now Jeremy Clarkson is set for a \u00a35million windfall after the Corporation bought out his stake in his production company. The Top Gear presenter set up Bedder 6 five years ago with the show\u2019s executive producer, Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme\u2019s global brand. Together the pair owned half the firm, while BBC Worldwide owned the other half. But now Clarkson and Wilman have given the BBC full control. Scroll down for video . In the money: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured with fellow Top Gear stars (from left) Richard Hammond, The Stig and James May, has sold his production company to the BBC . It is understood the total deal for both men is worth around \u00a38million. The money will come from the BBC\u2019s commercial division. The production company set up by Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear executive Andy Wilman, right, was formed for next to nothing in October 2006 and has now made them millions. The pair went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. Bedder 6 was later bought into by BBC Worldwide in 2007, purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company. Its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago, where it made a \u00a31.8million post-tax profit and paid out \u00a3700,000 to its shareholders. And now the BBC has bought Clarkson out - making him \u00a35million. There is speculation about where the name Bedder 6 comes from, and it is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. Martin Robinson . Separately, Clarkson is believed to be paid a \u00a3500,000 talent fee by the BBC from the licence fee, which will remain fixed if the show continues until 2015. In addition, Clarkson has signed a new deal with the corporation that will see him present Top Gear for another three years. Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \u2018BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial . deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear\u2019s . international future for another three years. 'This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world and return profits to the BBC.\u2019 He caused controversy when it emerged that he earned \u00a33 million in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6, as the company made pre-tax profits of \u00a315.2 million and is estimated to be worth more than \u00a350 million. It has had huge success making money out of merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international exploitation of the show. But Clarkson and Wilman, who have been . friends since their schooldays, resigned earlier this month, and BBC . Worldwide now have total ownership of the company. Showstopper: It has also been revealed Clarkson has signed up to present Top Gear for the next three years . Publicly the corporation is saying it cannot say how much the pair have paid for their stakes, but insiders say it is below \u00a310 million. Clarkson will still get a share of Top Gear commercial revenue generated by the show, in return for promoting the show worldwide. His fellow presenters also signed a three-year deal with BBC Worldwide, suggesting that they will continue to work on the show until 2015, and will also receive money from commercial activities, in addition to the talent fee. The money will be paid to them directly rather than through a private company. Clarkson and Wilman\u2019s windfalls because of Top Gear\u2019s success have left many at the BBC uncomfortable as the organisation attempts to make cutbacks. By Martin Robinson . Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's efforts as a presenter and writer. But there have been plenty of problems along the way, and Clarkson has often been at the centre of the controversy. In November 2008 he decided to make a joke about changing gear in a lorry and how tough a job it is - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright - who murdered several sex workers in Ipswich. Complaining Clarkson said (pictured right and video below): 'Change . gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, . change gear, change gear, murder.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he made a joke about a woman in a . burka wearing a red G-string to illustrate dangerous driving conditions, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints as a result. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. But probably his most controversial moment came as he appeared on the One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families' (video below). Clarkson . was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation . after his remark, made on The One Show, sparked around 31,700 . complaints. But he was later cleared."}]}

Saheena Tegally, pictured, has been cleared of trying to let an uninsured driver off following a flirtatious exchange of messages . A policewoman accused of trying to let an uninsured Porsche driver off after they exchanged flirtatious messages has been cleared of perverting the course of justice. WPC Saheena Tegally, 26, swapped numbers with Richard Myerson after she pulled him over for an insurance check, London's Wood Green Crown Court heard. They sent texts and emails to each other, including one in which Mr Myerson suggested the Metropolitan Police officer should sit at her desk in her underwear after she complained about the heat, the jury was told. In another message, the court heard the West Hampstead-based officer told Mr Myerson 'It's really hot. I'm in my bikini catching the sun.' Prosecutors claimed WPC Tegally falsely told other officers that Mr Myerson had been covered when he was stopped because he was flirting with her and asked her out on a date. But she denied perverting the course of justice, telling her trial that the messages the couple swapped were just 'banter' and she never had any intention of meeting him on a date. The jury of eight women and four men unanimously found WPC Tegally not guilty of perverting the course of justice today, less than two hours after they retired to consider their verdicts. Wearing a black blazer, pink top and black skirt, WPC Tegally, of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock and hugged members of her family after leaving the courtroom. Following the verdict, WPC Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' Her mother added: 'She needs to rest, it's been a tough year.' During the trial, WPC Tegally said that at the time of the alleged offence in July last year she had just broken off a relationship, during which she had undergone an abortion. The court heard the officer sent Mr Myerson a text saying 'far too hot to be stuck in uniform', to which he replied 'you could sit behind your desk in your underwear, then people will take bad news much easier'. Saheena Tegally (pictured) of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock after a jury cleared her of perverting the course of justice . She admitted she had been 'flattered' by the attention after the court heard she sent a text to a friend, saying she had 'seized a Porsche off a 25-year-old, he is minted and has asked to take me out'. During cross-examination, Miss Tegally said: 'It was flattering, yes it was. But that doesn't for one minute mean I was going to meet up with him or go for a drink. 'It was never my plan to go with him.' She told the jury she had still been in love with her ex-partner at the time, and still was, so would not have met up with Mr Myerson. Ms Tegally admitted that she helped Mr Myerson receive insurance documents and was sent via email documents showing he had not been insured but claimed she did not read them closely and initially assumed he was covered. She told the court it was just a mistake on her part and that she had never told her superiors definitively that he had been legally driving, only telling them it 'looked like' he was. She also denied a prosecution claim that she deliberately deleted emails relating to the case. Outside London's Wood Green Crown Court, Ms Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' She said she created a proper 'paper trail' but the emails may have been lost after she deleted a large number from her account simultaneously without checking them, following a warning about not having enough space. She added: 'Although I was going through a bad time, I worked hard to become a police officer. 'I was struggling but it was, and still is, my life.' Ms Tegally, who joined the Met as a community support officer in 2007, was suspended by the force pending the outcome of the trial.

Patrick Tuter, a former Garland police officer, has been indicted on a charge of manslaughter by a Grand Jury, the first time in 15 years that an officer has been charged over a fatal shooting . It is the first time in 15 years that an officer has been indicted for a fatal shooting while on duty. On August 31 Tuter spotted Allen's white GMC pickup and recognised it as having been involved in a chase with Sachse police. He tried to stop the vehicle, but Allen fled, leading to a half hour chase that only ended when Tuter opened fire. The former officer had tried to claim that Allen rammed into a police vehicle while cops were trying to box him in, however video footage taken from a dash camera has since revealed that officers actually rammed Allen. Tuter then opened fire, letting off 41 rounds and hitting Allen, from Wylie, three times which killed him. Tuter initially claimed he opened fire after Michael Vincent Allen rammed police vehicles while they tried to box him in. However footage shot from a dashboard camera showed police actually rammed Allen . According to witness reports from the time, Tuter reloaded his pistol at least once. Mitchell Wallace, who lived in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, told The Dallas Morning News last year that he was asleep when the gunshots began. He said: 'There was a pause in between the firing that made me believe he was reloading. From the time they yelled, \"Get out, get out,\" they didn\u2019t give him three seconds to get out.' In a separate incident officer Cardan Spencer, another Dallas policeman, was fired from the force after shooting Bobby Bennett, a mentally ill man with a knife who had said he wanted police to kill him. Again video played an important role after authorities initially said that Bennett had aggressively come at the officers with the knife raised.

I write this as someone who not only thought that the act would be overturned, but also still thinks there are strong constitutional arguments to be made against the mandate. All Americans, however, regardless of their partisan affiliation or views on the Constitution, had something to celebrate Thursday . Despite what almost all the pundits predicted, the court's decision provides some evidence that there remains one institution of American government that cannot be seen as nakedly partisan. In the end, Chief Justice John Roberts, a career Republican who was nominated for the Supreme Court by George W. Bush, cast the deciding vote upholding the signature act of the current Democratic administration. This, I think, is what Americans indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who, four years earlier, had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would \"slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states.\" Unfortunately, the divide between Republicans and Democrats has, if anything, gotten worse over the past 3\u00c2\u00bd years. Of course, each side blames the other for this result; they are both right. More blame, however, is not what is needed. We used to refer to Congress, or at least the Senate, as the \"world's greatest deliberative body.\" We all know that very little of what might be termed \"deliberation\" goes on within either chamber nowadays. Instead, Republicans attack Democrats, and Democrats attack Republicans. To deliberate means to consider something carefully. It means you have to listen to and weigh the position of your opponent. Unfortunately, in today's world, partisans have adopted what amounts to a version of political fundamentalism in which giving any credence to the other side's position is a form of heresy. But deliberate is exactly what the Supreme Court does. It is a far from perfect process, and yes, the court is affected by politics. As James Madison reminded us, however, neither the government nor the governed are angels. Perfection is not to be expected. Some attempt, however, to think through issues in a nonprejudicial way is required. Of course, Supreme Court justices have advantages. They do not have to stand for election and, as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read Thursday, they do not have to take a position on whether a law \"embodies sound policies.\" Nevertheless, the court, and particularly the chief justice, offered an important lesson to the political branches on Thursday on how they might undertake to solve the nation's problems. Will those who serve in the political branches listen? Their initial reactions are certainly not encouraging. The president and Congress may, however, want to take a look at current approval polls. Although even their numbers have declined lately, the Supreme Court has a much higher net approval number (+8), than Obama (-4), or the Congress (-62). Hopefully, the court's numbers will be improved after Thursday's decision. Both the Republicans and Democrats will doubtless find fault with Roberts' opinion, but the example of bipartisan deliberation that the court provided was much needed in today's political climate. \"This Honorable Court\" deserves our gratitude. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Sracic."}]}

An experienced construction worker was crushed to death by a tonne of wet concrete while working on a Crossrail building site, an inquest heard today. Slovakian Rene Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn, on March 7 last year, becoming the first fatality on the \u00a315 billion project. Mr Tkacik, of Hackney Road, east London, had been working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter Esther to go to university, a statement from his wife Renata said. The court heard that Mr Tkacik, 44, 'didn't know what he was supposed to do' on some occasions because of his lack of English. He was  crushed by a tonne of concrete after he went to check the surface of the tunnel - suffering 'devastating injuries incompatible with life'. He  was employed by contractor BFK and had been working on the section of tunnel which had been widened. His mother, widow and three sisters were in court today for the inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court. Speaking to the family Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I accepted that we will have a lot of detailed discussion about the matters of concrete spraying. 'But I recognise at the heart of all of this is your loved one.' In a statement read in court Mr Tkacik's widow Renata said she last saw her husband five days before his death. She said: 'He studied as a miner and worked as a blaster in a uranium mine. 'When he worked in the mine he was responsible for people's lives. He worked in different countries. 'He moved to Spain and worked there as a cement sprayer and he had huge experience in that. He was well read and taught himself Spanish.' She explained he came to the UK to work on Crossrail as a concrete sprayer to raise money to send his daughter to university. She said: 'To work on Crossrail he had to complete four exams which he passed first time. Not many people were admitted to the project and he did the exams in Spanish . First casualty: The 44-year-old construction worker was\u00a0the first fatality on the \u00a315 billion project (file picture) 'He had difficult living conditions and wasn't able to sleep properly and was constantly tired. His English was rudimentary and he was working with a lot of people speaking English. At times he didn't know what he was supposed to do. She added: 'He would take a dictionary to work and people were rude to him because he didn't understand them. 'He had become so tired and found himself a flat. I came to visit him there and I hardly recognised him, he had got out of his sleep routine and found it hard to get back into it. The 2nd of March was the last time I saw him.' The court also heard how he kept to himself in the evenings and would call his wife instead of meeting up with co-workers as he did not drink and never did drugs. The jury also heard from Metropolitan police detective sergeant Kavin McGrath who showed the jury a digital image of the tunnel where Mr Tkacik had been working when he died. He showed the court where the machine which had been spaying the concrete on to the walls of the tunnel and where the concrete had fallen. He said: 'At the time of the fall, the concrete spraying machine had run out of concrete and was waiting to be refilled. 'It appeared the deceased was in an exclusion area underneath the concrete. He also had a shovel in his hand at the time the concrete fell. Scene of the accident: Mr Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn on March 7 last year . 'It was just under a tonne of concrete that came down, which is the equivalent of a bag of building sand.' The detective added: 'It happened within a second and people further up the tunnel came down to help and they pulled him away from the danger zone and tried to resuscitate him.' An ambulance crew were first called to the scene and then the London Air Ambulance but he was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.14am. Before the start of proceedings campaigners and union members who were part of the Construction Safety Campaign protested outside calling for a full investigation into the health and safety of Crossrail. The coroner heard submissions from the family's legal team for the evidence from two witnesses to be heard, who would have given information about the safety processes at other Crossrail sites. However the request was rejected by the Ms Hassle who said: 'There is a danger this inquest will turn into a review of Crossrail, this inquest cannot do that and this is not a public inquiry to consider Crossrail's operations across London.

Whether it was jealousy or nervousness, this bird of prey's antics almost ruined the big day for a bride and groom. Lilo the Barn owl was supposed to be flying the rings down the aisle for Ceire and Andrew Bode but he decided to head for the rafters and refused to come down. Mr Bode, 32, tried to coax Lilo down with a piece of chicken but he remained on his perch and it was only when his handler produced a dead chick that they managed to get him down. Wedding chaos: Lilo the Barn Owl (pictured) was supposed to fly Cerie and Andrew Bode's rings to the altar - but instead flew into the roof . The couple, who got married in Hoghton, Lancashire, said Lilo\u2019s performance helped calm their nerves and made sure the day was even more memorable. Flown off: Lilo the Barn owl sits on a rafter holding onto the rings and refuses to come down - despite efforts to tempt it with chicken . Ceire, 33, said: 'It was absolutely hilarious. We wanted our wedding to be something different and this made sure it was. 'If we\u2019d just had the owl delivering the rings then our guests would have talked about it for maybe five minutes. 'Because of what happened, people are still talking about it now. It really broke the ice and stopped everyone feeling nervous.' Andrew, who hired Lilo for \u00a3150 from a bird sanctuary, said: 'Ceire is a big Harry Potter fan and she wanted to incorporate this into the wedding day. 'We\u2019ve also been to hundreds of weddings in the past through work so we wanted one with a difference. 'The owl was at the back of the church with one of the people from the sanctuary. 'None of the guests knew we had an owl as ringbearer so it was a surprise for them when, after we\u2019d said our vows, I picked up a glove and a piece of chicken. 'I\u2019d been told to make a clicking sound with my mouth to call the owl over, but it wasn\u2019t coming. 'Eventually it started flying up the aisle, but then it veered off and almost flew in Ceire\u2019s face. Then it just flew up into the beams and stayed up there for about five minutes - only it felt a lot longer. 'But we didn\u2019t know how to get the bird down and the guy from the sanctuary pulled out a dead chick to coax it down. Wedding chaos: The couple, who hired the owl as ringbearer, were relieved when the owl was eventually be tempted down from the rafter . 'It was a bit of a surreal moment really, I didn\u2019t expect to be holding a piece of chicken and trying to lure an owl down from the roof with a dead chick on my wedding day. 'The guests were all really laughing. And it did stop me from feeling so nervous.' Ceire added: 'I didn\u2019t mind at all. It was still the best day of my life. Everything else went to plan, this was just a little hiccup in my perfect day.' The couple, who have been together for seven years, have taken a long weekend to the Lake District for their honeymoon. In September this year another owl held up a wedding after it flew to the roof of a church and fell asleep on a ledge. On that occasion the owl could not be coaxed down and so Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mettle, 49, had to get married using a back up set of rings. It remained perched high inside the 900 year-old Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire, for an hour after falling asleep.

She managed to get up and move to the center of the house. \"Amazing what you can do when you have to,\" she said. The tree's impact left a large, visible crack through her ceiling. Now, days later, Campbell sits on her porch in a wheelchair, surviving record heat with no power and a quickly dwindling supply of food. Her husband managed to get some staples such as bread. \"There was no lunch meat or anything that we found in the stores, but there is always peanut butter,\" she told CNN with a smile. \"We're tough, we'll make it. West Virginians -- we can make it.\" The lack of power and limited food supply have put her in the same boat as millions of others this week. Triple digit strategies for staying healthy . As of Wednesday night, 699,000 customers scattered across 11 states had no electricity, down from about 1.8 million late Monday -- and from a peak of 4 million over the weekend. A household is considered one customer, so the actual number of people without power is higher. Pepco power company, which serves the D.C. metro area, said it expected to restore power by the end of Wednesday to 90% of its customers who lost electricity. West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said about 300,000 customers were without power Wednesday morning. That number appeared to have dropped to 238,000 by evening. Parts of his state as well as South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska were under heat advisory warnings. Excessive heat warnings were in place for portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. The National Weather Service said those areas would be scorched with temperatures near or above triple digits. As Americans celebrated Independence Day, many in the affected regions are focused on finding ways to get by until power can finally be restored. Eddie Harmon and his family in South Charleston, West Virginia, have spent nights sleeping in a car just to avoid the oppressive heat inside their home. One of his daughters has gone to stay with her grandmother, who has a generator. He walked to visit some neighbors to make sure they're OK, he said in an iReport. Getting around is tough because many gas stations have run out of supplies. People are running out of cash as well and the ATMs have run out, he said. Ironically, a previous power outage paid off, he said. His deep-freeze freezer had 3 inches of solid ice at the bottom because of a power outage two winters ago -- and that helped keep some chicken cold enough to be safe for cooking. \"I actually had cold Corn Flakes last night before I went to bed because I had milk that was still good,\" he said in a YouTube video Tuesday. Tomblin said Wednesday that while food is in short supply, \"we've made a lot of progress\" since the storm. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . The Democrat praised federal officials for their assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \"has responded fantastically,\" providing generators and ice within hours of the state's request, he said. Jeanne Campbell was among those who got power back and then lost it again -- meaning more wasted money and more wasted food. And with the large tree that shaded her house now down, she can't spend much time indoors. \"With a tin roof, it's gonna get even hotter now,\" she said. But, she added with a smile, she can deal with the inconveniences. \"I'm not worried.\" David McMann, in Charleston, West Virginia, has paid a price for the storm and lack of power at his home. He raises koi fish and lost three as a result. \"It was hard to watch them die, and stand by knowing I had done all I could do.\" One of the fish \"was 15 years old and had become almost a friend, if that is possible,\" he said in an iReport. \"This has been an expensive storm for us in more ways than one. This was to have been our vacation. Our traveling has been put off, for we do not have any idea when the power will be restored. I am 63 years old and have been through hurricanes in Virginia and Florida. I have never experienced the wrath of nature any stronger than what blew through these mountains on Friday evening.\" While some of the most harrowing tales come from West Virginia, people throughout much of the Northeast have been struggling as well. Mark Cohen sent iReport a video of his destroyed yard and neighborhood in Mays Landing, New Jersey, showing downed trees, smashed cars and damage to his home. \"We would have been better off with a tornado,\" he said. Cohen, his daughter and his girlfriend have been sleeping in the basement to stay cool. Despite damage to his home, Cohen is looking at the bigger picture. \"When you see this around you -- I'm not an emotional guy -- you quickly think, 'Wow this is nothing. It could have been so much worse,' \" he said. \"You think about the people around the country losing their houses and you can't complain. It's inconvenient, but big picture, we're fine.\" The heat-driven storm that started Friday has resulted in at least 22 deaths from Ohio to New Jersey, 13 of them in Virginia. Another three people in North Carolina died in a second round of storms Sunday. People react to record temps: \"It's not the heat, it's the stupidity\" CNN's Maria White, Jake Carpenter and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report."}]}

Gambia's president has demanded a United Nations investigation into the 'manmade sinking, capsizing' of boats carrying migrants to Europe, saying 500 citizens of his African country had died in such incidents in the past five years. Migrants have been streaming out of North Africa, mostly lawless Libya, in rickety boats in rising numbers for years. Many head for Italy, a gateway to the European Union. Nearly 3,000 of those migrants have drowned in shipwrecks this year. Earlier this month, some 500 migrants are believed to have died after traffickers rammed their ship off Malta's coast, leaving only nine survivors. At the U.N. General Assembly, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh described these incidents as 'the very dangerous, racist and inhuman behavior of deliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to sink.' 'The U.N. must conduct a full and impartial investigation into this manmade sinking, capsizing of these boats carrying young Africans to Europe,' Jammeh said. 'If these boats are able to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea only to sink on European coasts, we must find out what deadly mysterious force exists on the European Mediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young Africans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival,' he said. Dozens of civil defense officials, medical staff and police were waiting at dockside to receive the people after the cruise ship had docked. A small group did disembark from the ship to negotiate with authorities, authorities said, but talks broke off with the group returning to the ship. But several adults holding small children were seen leaving the cruise ship, while one man led away by police in handcuffs. The cruise ship had answered a distress signal from a trawler sailing some 50 nautical miles off the Cyprus coast in poor weather conditions, the Cyprus defence ministry said. Salamis Cruise Lines Managing Director Kikis Vasiliou\u00a0said his company received the request from Cypriot Search and Rescue authorities to assist in the rescue operation on Thursday morning while the cruise ship was returning to Cyprus from the Greek islands. But he said the unexpected turn of events is costing his company 'several hundred thousand' euros after the cancellation of a trip by 300 mainly Russian tourists to Haifa, Israel aboard the cruise ship that was scheduled to depart late Thursday. The Cypriot Defense Ministry said the boat had 'most likely' set sail from Syria loaded with 'civilian refugees.' They will remain at a reception center near the capital Nicosia until authorities determine what will happen to them. The Mediterranean has been plagued by shipwrecks in recent months involving migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says more than 2,500 people have drowned or been reported lost at sea this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. In one of the deadliest wrecks on record, a ship carrying some 500 migrants - including Syrians, Palestinians and Egyptians - was deliberately sunk by traffickers off Malta earlier this month, leaving just 10 known survivors. In trouble: The cruise ship had answered a distress signal from a trawler sailing some 50 nautical miles off the Cyprus coast in poor weather conditions . New liner work: The liner had been en route from the Greek island of Syros to Limassol when it received a call to assist in the rescue operation . Cyprus is located about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the shores of war-ravaged Syria. In August 2012, seven Syrians, including two children, drowned when the boat they were sailing to Cyprus to escape the conflict in their homeland sank off the island's northern coast. Thousands of migrants fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and northern Africa attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea in rickety boats in search of safe havens in Europe, and hundreds have died at sea."}]}

Police have seized scissors and knives from the home of a 21-year-old woman charged with dismembering and strangling her newborn son moments after delivering the baby in the bathroom. 'Horrific crime': Lillian Alvarado, 21, has charged with dismembering her newborn son on Thanksgiving last year . Lillian Alvarado has been ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after she was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and cruelty to children on Thursday, months after police first stumbled upon the shocking crime in northwest Washington. Police were first called to Alvarado's apartment in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW on November 28 after downstairs neighbors complained of bloody water dripping from the ceiling. Authorities said cops arrived at the apartment just before noon on Thanksgiving and that, once Alvarado could be coaxed out of the bathroom, she sat on the bed and said 'forgive me', The Washington Post reported. It was then police found the dead baby, with umbilical cord still attached, lying in an inch of blood and water in the bathtub, with a pair of scissors in the sink. Alvarado\u2019s 70-year-old father, Santiago Alvarado, said family members thought his daughter was taking a shower that morning. He said that she has a history of mental illness and that during episodes, she is unable to communicate. Alvarado came to the United States from El Salvador about a year ago, the father said, fleeing the violence in her native country, where her husband was killed. Scene: Lillian Santiago lived with relatives in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW, Washington. Family members said they believed she was showering on the morning on November 28, when the alleged crime occurred . She made a living cleaning houses in the Washington area and 'worked very hard', he said. Alvarado told her father she didn't know she was pregnant and that the baby was stillborn. However on Thursday the medical examiner said there were air bubbles found in the infant's lungs, meaning that he had died after the birth. The autopsy also found that the newborn\u2019s neck had been compressed, and there were signs of drowning. The cause of death was determined as dismemberment and asphyxiation. Alvarado told police that she knew she was pregnant in April or May, and she believed that by November she was seven months along, according to court documents obtained by The Post. She said she woke up at 6 am on Thanksgiving with a sharp pain and told others in the home that she was sick from something she ate. She later went into the bathroom, where her water broke. According to the charging documents, Alvarado got into the shower, thinking she was about to go to the hospital, and that the baby was born there. The affidavit says she told police she cut the umbilical cord with scissors and did not hear the baby cry. She told police that she remembers hitting her head on the sink as she got out of the tub and flushing the toilet, but then 'everything went dark'. Relatives told police that Alvarado went in and out of the bathroom all morning, once asking for a pair of pants, another time fetching a plunger from a hall closet. 'This was a horrific crime that occurred on Thanksgiving Day to an innocent child killed by his mother,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Wright said at a D.C. Superior Court hearing, arguing that the suspect is a danger to the community. Santiago Alvarado said his daughter has a history of mental illness. 'She has mental disturbances sometimes, and when that happens, she doesn\u2019t talk,' the father said in Spanish. 'She goes out of her mind. The doctors diagnosed her with a sickness.' He said he did not know the official diagnosis. Lillian Alvarado has a two-year-old daughter who was taken by social workers the same day the baby was born, he said. Santiago Alvarado said that his daughter was hospitalized for about a month after the baby\u2019s death and that he just received a bill for $24,000. They have not spoken since her arrest."}]}

Despite his playboy persona, Prince Harry has made no secret of his desire to settle down if he could find the the 'right person' who was 'willing to take on the job'. Now it seems he has found 'The One' in the form of  Cressida Bonas, a member of the so called  BBB Crew - Blue-Bloods And Blonde - who he has been dating since last year. Despite being coy when quizzed about his love life while in Afghanistan at the end of last year, the Prince made no secret of his affection for the 24 year old beauty this week as they were pictured embracing on the slopes during a ski holiday with his uncle Prince Andrew and family. Public display of affection: Prince Harry embraces Cressida Bonas on the ski slopes in Switzerland this week .

A source told today's Sun that the Prince is keen to accompany Cressida to the wedding because: 'Harry and Cressie are at . the exciting stage of a relationship where they just want to spend as . much time together as possible.' Date night: The blue blood blonde was first linked to the Prince last May when they were seen leaving a night club together . Girlfriend in waiting: Prince Harry has been coy about their relationship until now . Wedding bells: The couple are due to attend the wedding of Sam Branson to Cressida's half sister Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe . As any woman in a fledgling . relationship will know, a beau agreeing to attend a family wedding with . you is a promising sign of commitment. So while Harry, 28, may be a long way . from popping the question himself, his recent behaviour suggests he's . now prepared for Cressida to go from being his casual date to filling . the role of royal girlfriend. Indeed, before his trip to . Afghanistan, friends of privately-educated Cressida had joked that she . was his 'girlfriend-in-waiting'. Given the intense press interest in . royal love lives and the impact Harry has seen it have on the life of . his late mother Princess Diana, and more recently the Duchess of . Cambridge, it's no surprise he has wanted to shield Cressida from the . public gaze for as long as possible. Blue-blood: Cressida with her mother Lady Mary Gaye at the Macmillan . Cancer Relief Dog Day held at the Royal Hospital Chelsea South Grounds . in July 2003 . The fact his long-term relationship . with Chelsy Davy broke down because she wasn't prepared for a life in . the global spotlight could have also played on his mind. But according to the Evening . Standard's royal correspondent, Robert Jobson, Harry's public display of . affection with Cressida this week was 'a clear message of intent' from . the media savvy prince. That message being, 'she's my girl, and I don't . care who knows.' While being the subject of global media attention is new to Cressida, mingling with the rich, famous and royal, is not. She is friends with both Princess . Beatrice and Eugenie, joining the former in the world record attempt to . complete the London Marathon in a human caterpillar in 2010, while the . latter is said to have introduced her to Harry. Royal circles: Cressida Bonas (second from right) went to Ascot in 2010 with friends Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie . Record breaker: Cressida, bottom right, joined Princess Beatrice in a human caterpillar to complete the London Marathon in 2010 . She is the daughter of renowned Sixties It girl Lady Mary Gaye Curzon (whose father was the 6th Earl Howe) and Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas (her mother's third husband) owns a fabric company . called MacCulloch & Wallis. Her parents have racked up six . marriages between them so Cressida has a number of half brothers and . sisters including soon-to-be a Branson, Isabella, who was once admired . by Prince William, and Gabriella Wilde, a model for Burberry. Following her parent's separation, Cressida continued to enjoy a privileged upbringing as her bohemian mother then married multi-millionaire Christopher Shaw. Cressida attended \u00a330,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham where she showed a flair for acting as well as sport. She was said to be one of the most popular girls at the sixth form because of her zest for fun and free spirit. Fun: The dance student, left and far right, loves music festivals and socialising with friends . \u2018It was non-stop laughter and . mischief for two years,\u2019 her school friend told the Daily Mail last . year. \u2018Our group of girls were all quite different and arty, which is . more Cress.\u2019 She then attended Leeds University where she studied for a degree in dance and had another boyfriend with royal connections - Harry . Wentworth-Stanley \u2013 whose stepfather, George Milford Haven, is a cousin . of the Queen. Dancing is the blonde's passion and she now studies contemporary dance at The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich. In the spotlight: The world's media will now be watching Cressida . She is said to dislike the London . Sloane party scene usually popular with the upper classes and instead . prefers letting her hair down at music festivals. Her friends say, 'when not in the studio she's out on the tennis court or up a mountain with her skis.' She's also a fan of travelling, . having spent time after university working in Australia, which would . suit Prince Harry when he undertakes royal tours. He lamented travelling solo last year . to Jamaica for the Queen's Jubilee saying: 'I've always said that it\u2019d . probably be easier as a couple. I don\u2019t have anyone. I wasn\u2019t allowed to . bring anybody with me. Perhaps that won't be the case for much longer now things are getting more serious with Cressida.

Clinton met with Guy Cecil, the outgoing head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, on Wednesday in Washington, according to Politico, and has talked with Robby Mook, a former Clinton aide, about 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 Both are seen as frontrunner for the top job in a Clinton campaign. Although Clinton's spokesman said he wouldn't confirm or deny the meeting and conversations occurred, Nick Merrill acknowledged that Clinton is talking with a wide array of people about 2016. \"As she decides, she's casting a wide net and wants to hear from a variety of people on a range of specific topics, from policy ideas to what a successful campaign would look like,\"  Merrill said in an email. Democrats have repeatedly said that Clinton has yet to make up her mind, but according to people close to Clinton, there have long been four names in the campaign manager race: Cecil, Mook, Stephanie Schriock and Ace Smith. Here is what you need to know about each. Cecil: . Although Cecil, as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was at the helm when Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, he is close with the Clintons -- particularly Bill Clinton -- and worked as Hillary Clinton's national political and field director in 2008. Cecil is an unpretentious figure and has won the trust of many on Capitol Hill. Earlier in his career he led the standard journeyman campaign life, working for campaigns in Arkansas, North Carolina and Colorado (where he led Sen. Michael Bennet's dark-horse win in 2010). Cecil has been hesitant to talk about Clinton publicly as she considers a 2016 run and did not respond to an email for this story. Mook: . The then 33-year-old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered Gov. Terry McAuliffe to victory in Virginia in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to Clinton as a smart choice for campaign manager. Before working for McAuliffe, Mook was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in 2008 steered the Clinton presidential campaign to wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana. Mook, who has a loyal following in his own Democratic circle, started his political career working for then Gov. Howard Dean in Vermont. Like Cecil, Mook has been hesitant to comment publicly on Clinton's 2016 bid. He did, however, make the most interesting splash of any of the possible campaign managers when emails he sent to a group of supporters were leaked to ABC. In the emails, which were sent to a group called the \"Mook Mafia,\" the operative urged his supporters to \"smite Republicans mafia-style.\" Schriock: . Schriock currently has what she calls \"one of the very best jobs in American politics right now\" and it wouldn't be a stretch to say Hillary Clinton probably agrees. As head of Emily's List, Schriock's goal is to help elect pro-choice, Democratic women across the country -- something Clinton regularly talks about on the stump. Schriock, the often-on-message campaign veteran, started her career as Dean's 2004 finance director, where she tapped into a new revenue stream -- the internet -- to raise money. She then went on to lead high profile Senate campaigns, including Jon Tester's in Montana and Al Franken's in Minnesota, to wins. Schriock briefed the press at last month's Ready for Hillary strategy session, where she flatly said she was \"not going to talk about\" a possible role in the Clinton campaign. \"I am not going to talk about any conversation I may or may not be having with any candidate who may or may not be running for office,\" she said. Smith: . Smith, a California based consultant with deep ties to the Clinton, would be the dark horse in this field of four. While Smith led Hillary Clinton's campaign to 2008 wins in California, Texas and North Carolina, it is the list of other Democrats he has worked for that is impressive: Richard Daley, Paul Simon, Ann Richards, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, to name a few. People close to Clinton say that Smith would be a good, outside-the-beltway choice for campaign manager. Although he had deep ties to Washington -- through the people he has worked for -- Smith is based in California and has focused on the state in the last few years. And it seems like Smith is interested. \"Anything Hillary Clinton asks me to do, I will do,\" Smith told the San Francisco Chronicle in November. \"I'm a huge charter member of the Hillary Clinton fan club.\""}]}

The Harlequins scrum-half was officially withdrawn from Saturday\u2019s series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park once it became apparent that he had failed to recover from a shoulder injury in time to play. His removal means that Ben Youngs of Leicester will join forces with Freddie Burns in an untried half-back combination, while Lee Dickson comes on to the bench. It emerged that Care\u2019s injury stemmed from an incident on Monday that initially prompted much amusement among team-mates and management. Asked how the 27-year-old had hurt his shoulder, defence coach Andy Farrell said: \u2018It\u2019s his own fault actually. Tradition: The England team walk onto the pitch during the Captain's Run at Eden Park . Put your back into it: Rob Webber pushes a weights sled .

I burst out laughing but then realised it wasn\u2019t too funny. \u2018It . was a little grubber through on the floor, which he mis-kicked. He . won\u2019t be doing it again. I\u2019ve got it on tape. I showed it to all the . lads the next day; it was hilarious. But it wasn\u2019t quite as good two . days later when he wasn\u2019t playing in the Test match. Anyway, we\u2019ll get . over it.\u2019 The . joke lost its appeal very quickly, as the loss of Care is another . grievous blow to English hopes of causing an upset in the opening clash . with the world champions. He was an integral part of the team\u2019s . attacking development during the Six Nations and his vibrant presence . will be sorely missed. Yet, . Farrell suggested the coaches are optimistic that the Yorkshireman will . be available for selection in Dunedin next week. \u2018He was very close,\u2019 he said. \u2018He's a couple of days off and we expect him to be fully fit . for next week, but his strength wasn't quite there. Lookout: Stuart Lancaster runs the rule over his England charges at Eden Park . Faster! Chris Pennell takes a sprint test as England prepare for the All Blacks . Where's the pass? Marland Yarde takes control of the ball during training . \u2018He's . settling down nicely, but the player has to be mentally right that he's . 100 per cent fit. We have good replacements in Ben and Lee. Danny will . rest this one out and start training again on Monday and Tuesday next . week. \u2018He's been in great form, not just throughout the Six Nations when he was outstanding, but he finished the season really well at Harlequins. In general he was in very confident mood coming over here and was looking forward to the tour.\u2019 England have been beset by the absence of so many leading lights for this first Test, due to a pile-up of injuries and fixtures. But the tourists are refusing to be demoralised and accept a grisly fate against Steve Hansen\u2019s experienced, outstanding Kiwi team. Farrell claimed that the visitors will take heart from some rousing performances and results on the road in the last two years. \u2018We\u2019re not frightened of the occasion \u2013 of going to these places and giving it a good crack,\u2019 he said. 'For some of these guys, it\u2019s new to come here, it was new to go to South Africa and for some of them it was new to play in Paris. Everything is new to us but we don\u2019t shirk it. There is always a fighting spirit there. The fighting spirit has been in this team since the start.\u2019 Sitting it out: Danny Care (right) will miss England's first Test with New Zealand on Saturday . Blow: Care (left) was injured in a training ground incident when he fell on his shoulder after taking a kick . Coming through: Joe Marler holds onto the ball during the England training session . Tough task: England are preparing to face New Zealand but will be huge underdogs . Breather: James Haskell takes a break after the training session . Preparation: England face a daunting challenge in New Zealand . The All Blacks haven\u2019t lost at Eden Park since 1994. Their imperious record in their Auckland lair and their dominance of this rivalry over the decades is a grim omen for England, but they are determined to ignore it. \u2018We know we\u2019ve only won twice here,\u2019 said Farrell. \u2018We know we\u2019ve only beaten the All Blacks seven times. \u2018We are aware of the history, but we\u2019re more aware of our own history of late and that\u2019s a side that started two years ago and guys are averaging 20-25 caps. They\u2019ve been through a journey together and we\u2019re seeing the improvements. There\u2019s still a long way to go, but we need to come to places like New Zealand, to test ourselves and see where we\u2019re at.\u2019"}]}

He was dismissed towards the end of his second season in charge with Bayern sitting fourth in the Bundesliga and already out of the DFB-Pokal, bringing to an end a relationship which had not always been easy according to the Bayern chairman.

Guardiola won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and FIFA Club World Cup in his first season in charge, and then strengthened the squad with the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from league rivals Borussia Dortmund. Although both transfers were controversial - the first for its timing on the eve of Dortmund's Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid and the second being one of the game's worst-kept secrets with Bayern agreeing terms with the Polish striker even before they were permitted to speak to him - Rummenigge says they did German football a favour. 'If we hadn't signed them, they would now be playing abroad somewhere,' he said. 'Both make the league attractive.

Ali Saremi's body was buried over the weekend at the Amir-Abad village in Boroujerd, nearly 400 kilometers southwest of Tehran. \"The authorities never informed my family about my father's execution and now the government has barred us from holding any kind of funeral service,\" his son, Akbar Saremi, said. Ali Saremi was hanged for \"fighting against the sacred Islamic Republic of Iran system and launching antagonist propagations,\" Iranian state-run media reported at the time of his execution Tuesday. Iranian authorities allege that Saremi was a member of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, which has opposed the Iranian government for decades. Tehran considers the group to be a terrorist outfit, as does the United States. The European Union does not. Members of the Friends of a Free Iran group condemned Saremi's execution Tuesday, calling it \"another crime for which the mullahs will be held to account when freedom is finally restored to that beleaguered nation.\" The group also demanded that Iranian leaders \"be tried in the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity.\" Ali Saremi had been arrested five times since 1982. His latest arrest came in 2007 after visiting his son at Camp Ashraf, a refugee community in Iraq that is home to an estimated 3,500 exiled members of the Mujahedeen, Akbar Salemi told CNN. Saremi was arrested for his alleged presence at anti-revolutionary gatherings organized by the People's Mujahedeen and for sending information for the group, according to Iranian state media reports. Akbar Salemi denied those allegations, saying his father's \"only interest in Mojahedin-e Khalgh (MEK) and Camp Ashraf was to visit me, and that's the last time I saw my father.\" \"This is a very difficult time for my family,\" Akbar Saremi said, adding that other family members are being targeted now. \"My cousin is still being detained after he displayed a picture of my father on the door of the family home as a sign of mourning,\" Saremi said. Other family members were detained last week as they gathered outside the prison where Ali Saremi was hanged. They have since been released."}]}

Lucy Francis Maloney creates miniature replicas of deceased dogs for grieving owners . Lucy who lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota, came up with the idea in 1997 when her parents suggested creating a miniature version of their family dog, Old Ted, a Yorkshire terrier. Combining household items such as string and loose hair from her family pet, the first miniature mutt was born. Since then, she has created thousands of miniature dogs using yarn, chicken wire, and a selection of materials to replicate the fur including alpaca, cashmere, baby camel and occasionally real dog hair. Lucy creates her models using as little as an old photograph of the much-loved pet to work from . Lucy uses a selection of materials to replicate the fur including alpaca, cashmere and occasionally dog hair . Lucy has created thousands of dog models since she first started creating them in 1997 . The addition of glass eyes and fur grooming completes the life-like look. Having spent the last 18 years honing her skills, Lucy is now inundated with requests from pet owners across the world who are longing to resurrect their furry friends. Often spending hours to produce them with meticulous detail, customers from Netherlands, Russia, Qatar, Germany and the UK pay anything between $200 (\u00a3132) and $2,000 (\u00a31326) on Lucy's website for her realistic models. Lucy  created her first miniature model when the family pet Old Ted, a Yorkshire terrier, died in 1997 . Lucy's creations have received so much attention that she now receives orders from all over the world . The prospect of keeping a souvenir of their passed-on-pup has even seen Lucy receive interest from celebrity dog lovers, with Martha Stewart, Andrew WK, Shirley McLaine, John Prine and Keither Sykes all requesting a petite pooch of their own. Lucy, owner of three dogs, says that she has been fascinated with pooches her whole life and this job means she can do what she loves. 'My passion for dogs has been with me since my earliest memory. All I wanted was to do something with dogs. The artist now charges between\u00a0$200 (\u00a3132) and $2,000 (\u00a31,326) for her miniature creations . Lucy has even had several celebrities get in touch wanting to purchase a model including Martha Stewart . 'I started working with miniatures when I created my old dog Ted, but soon word of my mini dogs reached other pet lovers and I started creating peoples' dogs exact to the photos.' Lucy says that her replicas provide something that a photograph of an old pet can't. 'People loved the idea of a three dimensional piece to remember and cherish their pet. 'Customers are usually reduced to tears when they see their dog brought back to life.' The 61-year-old says that people are generally reduced to tears when they receive their models . As well as dogs that have passed away Lucy creates miniatures of live hounds too . Lucy says that she can completely emphasise with her customers and says that it is really rewarding to help owners through a difficult time. 'When a dog is brought back to the owner in a realistic way it always brings emotions to the fore. I always work to get the dog as perfect as the real one. 'I love to reach people suffering that loss. I myself know the pain of losing a pet, combined with my unequalled love of dogs; I feel I have a profound understanding of the grief.'

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addressed the  Republican National Convention on Wednesday. Here is the text of that speech: . Former Gov. Mitt Romney says Sen. John McCain will rein in government spending. Romney: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Ann and I love you all. We have a deep feeling in our hearts for you. We respect you for the values you have and the vision we have for America together. Thank you so much, our dear friends. We sure love you. Thank you. You know, for decades now, the Washington sun has been rising in the east. You see, Washington has been looking to the eastern elites, to the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and to the broadcasters from the -- from the coast. Yes.  Watch Romney's entire speech \u00bb . If America really wants to change, it's time to look for the sun in the west, because it's about to rise and shine from Arizona and Alaska. Last week, the Democratic convention talked about change. But what do you think? Is Washington now, liberal or conservative? Let me ask you some questions. Is a Supreme Court decision liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal. Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? It's liberal. Is a Congress liberal or conservative that stops nuclear power plants and off-shore drilling, making us more and more dependent on Middle Eastern tyrants? It's liberal. Is government spending, putting aside inflation, liberal or conservative if it doubles since 1980? It's liberal. We need change all right: change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington. We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington: Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin. It's the same prescription for a stronger economy. I spent 25 years in the private sector. I've done business in many foreign countries. I know why jobs come and why they go away. And I know that liberals don't have a clue. They think that we have the biggest and strongest economy in the world because of our government. They're wrong. America is strong because of the ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, and hard work of the American people. The American people have always been the source of our nation's strength, and they always will be. We strengthen our people and our economy when we preserve and promote opportunity. Opportunity is what lets hope become reality. Opportunity expands when there's excellence and choice in education, when taxes are lowered, when every citizen has affordable, portable health insurance, and when constitutional freedoms are preserved. Opportunity rises when children are raised in homes and schools that are free from pornography, and promiscuity, and drugs, where there are homes that are blessed with family values and the presence of a mom and a dad. America -- America cannot long lead the family of nations if we fail the family here at home. You see, liberals would replace opportunity with dependency on government largesse. They grow government and raise taxes to put more people on Medicaid, to take work requirements out of welfare, and to grow the ranks of those who pay no taxes at all. Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. It's time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is. You know, it's time for the party of big ideas, not the party of Big Brother. Our economy is under attack. China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids, buying oil from the world's worst and selling nuclear technology. Russia and the oil states are siphoning more than $500 billion a year from us in what could become the greatest transfer of economic wealth in the history of the world. This is no time for timid, liberal, empty gestures. Our economy has slowed down this year, and a lot of people are hurting. What happened? Mortgage money was handed out like candy, and speculators bought homes for free. And when this mortgage mania finally broke, it slammed the economy. And stratospheric gas prices made things even worse. Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government, and less trade with other nations. It's the same path Europe took a few decades ago. It leads to moribund growth and double-digit unemployment. The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago and by John McCain and Sarah Palin today. The right course is to rein in government spending, lower taxes, take a Weedwacker to excessive regulation and mandates, put a stop to tort windfalls, and to stand up to the Tyrannosaurus appetite of government unions. The right course -- the right course is to pursue every source of energy security, from new efficiencies to renewables, from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear, and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores. And I have -- I have one more recommendation for energy conservation: Let's keep Al Gore's private jet on the ground. Last week, last week, did you hear any Democrats talk about the threat from radical, violent jihad? No. You see, Republicans believe that there is good and evil in the world. Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire. George Bush labeled the terror-sponsor states exactly what they are: The axis of evil. And at Saddleback, after Barack Obama dodged and ducked every direct question, John McCain hit the nail on the head: Radical, violent Islam is evil, and he will defeat it. This party... You're hearing it here. You're hearing it here, and they're hearing it across the country. You see, in this party, in this room tonight, and all over America, people in our party prefer straight talk to politically correct talk. Republicans, led by John McCain and Sarah Palin, will fight to preserve the values that have preserved the nation. We'll strengthen our economy and keep us from being held hostage by Putin, Chavez, and Ahmadinejad. And we will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism. Just like you, just like you, there's never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We -- we Americans inherited the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. It's our burden and our privilege to preserve it, to renew its spirit so that its noble past is prologue to its glorious future. To this we're all dedicated. And I firmly believe, by the providence of the almighty, that we will succeed. President McCain and Vice President Palin will keep America as it has always been: The hope of the Earth. Thank you, and God bless America."}]}

Former Page 3 girl Jilly Johnson described Max Clifford as a \u2018gentleman\u2019 yesterday as she defended his reputation.

Clifford winked at the ex-glamour model from the dock as she tottered past on high heels after finishing her evidence. Scroll down for video . Jilly Johnson, 60, said Max Clifford, 70, was a 'perfect gentleman' who helped her with her career in the 1970s . The 70-year-old PR mogul is standing trial accused of 11 counts of indecent assault \u2013 all of which he denies. He allegedly groped, molested and abused a succession of girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1984. His accusers have claimed he wandered around his office naked and made them perform sex acts on him. But . yesterday, a woman famous for taking off her clothes told Southwark . Crown Court in London that Clifford had always behaved impeccably. The jury had been promised Clifford\u2019s \u2018celebrity\u2019 friends had not abandoned him, and blonde Miss Johnson was duly sworn in. She met Clifford when she was 17 and in 1975 she became the first woman to appear topless in the Daily Mirror. She . said she had dressed as \u2018provocatively as you could imagine, in mini . dresses and boots\u2019 when she knew the celebrity fixer in the 1970s. Now a 60-year-old grandmother, Miss Johnson wore an above-the-knee skirt and a smart jacket as she sat at the witness stand. Asked . to explain how Clifford behaved around her, Miss Johnson, a . twice-married mother-of-one, said: \u2018Respectfully, nothing untoward or . inappropriate. \u2018Literally as . a mentor, as a guide and as a great help. Yes, he was marvellous.\u2019 She . told the jury of six men and five women: \u2018I think he is a very . honourable man.

He is very much a gentleman.\u2019 The . former model, who was also a member of girl band Blonde on Blonde, said . Clifford had been crucial in helping her make the transition to . actress. She subsequently appeared on popular television programmes . including The Jim Davidson Show and The Des O\u2019Connor Show. Next . up in the witness box was a former secretary of Clifford, who attacked . suggestions that he regarded his offices as his \u2018sexual fiefdom\u2019. Jilly Johnson, 60, pictured left in 1977 and, right, last year, said Clifford gave her 'helpful' career advice . The . ex-model, who cannot be named, told jurors it was \u2018absolute nonsense\u2019 to suggest the offices in New Bond Street, central London, were . \u2018sexually charged\u2019. She said: \u2018The atmosphere was great. A lot of laughs. Max was a practical joker.\u2019 The . witness said that she\u00a0 never saw him walk around\u00a0 naked. She could not . recall a woman she knew telling her\u00a0 that Clifford had exposed himself . to her in his offices. \u2018If a . friend had said she had been assaulted, I think that is something that . would have stuck in my mind,\u2019 she said. \u2018The Max Clifford I knew would . never assault someone.\u2019 Clifford, who listened from the dock with a hearing aid loop, smiled as the women gave their evidence .

Diedra Taylor said she came . forward to be a character witness after the publicist was arrested. Tina . Tolfrey, a mother who knew Clifford through his work as a patron of . Chase Children\u2019s Hospice, said he was a \u2018hero\u2019 to young people who made . children\u2019s \u2018dreams come true\u2019 by taking them on trips to Disney parks . and football matches. \u2018The kids would look at him as an uncle figure,\u2019 she said. \u2018He\u2019s the gentlest, kindest person.\u2019 Clifford, wearing a bright blue blazer, white shirt and black trousers, smiled warmly at the women as they gave evidence.

Confusing: Millions are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system, the Government warned today . The Government wants to strip out red tape that makes it hard for workers to transfer their pensions throughout their careers into one pension.

He said: 'I am concerned that people are at risk of losing their small pension pots as they move from job to job.

The man claiming responsibility for the operation is a veteran jihadist who is also renowned for hostage-taking and smuggling anything from cigarettes to refugees. Read more: Islamists take foreign hostages in attack on Algerian oil field . His name is Moktar Belmoktar, an Algerian who lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan in his teens and has long been a target of French counter-terrorism forces. Today, he leads a group called Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones), which is associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM.)  In the last few years, he has cultivated allies and established cells far and wide across the region. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Assault on In Amenas . The gas complex where Belmoktar's followers struck at dawn Wednesday is in a region that has seen plenty of jihadist activity in recent years, in part because of the collapse of government authority across the Libyan border, just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from In Amenas. Counter-terrorism experts differ as to how the attackers - in several pickup trucks - may have reached In Amenas, but there are several roads and tracks across uninhabited desert from Libya. On the other side of the border, a patchwork of militia prevails rather than any government presence. A spokesman for Al-Mulathameen told Mauritanian news websites that the attack was in retaliation for Algeria permitting French overflights as part of the intervention in Mali. But regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in days. Robert Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat who was abducted by Belmoktar's followers in Niger in 2008 -- and met the man himself --  told CNN, \"I suspect they have an intelligence wing and they are constantly looking for ways to grab westerners and embarrass the West and confuse our options. And that's exactly what they are doing.\" Read more: Fallout from Mali battle goes global after militants seize Westerners in Algeria . In a 28-minute video that appeared on jihadist forums last month, Belmoktar warned that Al-Mulathameen would soon act against Western interests in the region. \"This is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries and we will attack your interests,\" he said. Announcing the formation of an elite commando unit called \"Those Who Sign With Blood,\" Belmoktar said it would be the shield against the \"invading enemy.\" Wednesday's attack in Algeria was claimed in the name of that unit, which Belmoktar said would include \"the best of our youth and mujahideen, foreign and local supporters.\" Counter-terrorism analysts tell CNN the language suggests this group was dispatched to carry out an act of jihad rather than abduct foreigners for ransom. Watch: Islamist militants attack oil field, two dead . \"This feels much more like attacks staged in the past by other al Qaeda affiliates, rather than another attempt to exchange hostages for ransom, as has often been AQIM's practice,\" said Andrew Lebovich, a long-time observer of AQIM currently in Senegal. \"Belmokhtar likely wants to show he is still engaged in active operations and he is not moving away from the fighting - especially at a time when other Jihadists are in active combat against French troops in Mali,\" he said. But it is also possible that Belmoktar may try to bargain for the release of al Qaeda operatives held in Algerian jails. In his December message, he said, \"To our captive people...it is our promise and our debt as long as we live that we will liberate you, and we sacrifice our lives for you and everything we own to free you.\" Three al Qaeda operatives were detained last July by Algerian security services, but it's not known whether they were close to Belmoktar.

He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname \"Belaouar\" -- the \"one-eyed\" -- after a battlefield injury, and joined forces with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters. Belmoktar later claimed he met al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in the Sudan in the mid 1990s. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar who has extensively studied AQIM, Belmoktar rose steadily through the ranks to become the GIA commander for the Sahara. After a popular backlash against the terrorist group in Algeria, Belmoktar switched allegiance to a spin-off group -- the GSPC -- in 2000, and continued to operate in the sub-Saharan region. The GIA was the forerunner of AQIM, which still counts many Algerians in its leadership. Belmoktar remains associated with this fissiparous group -- but is very much his own man. Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, is said to have demoted Belmoktar late last year from his position as 'Emir of the Sahel.' Belmoktar also feuded with a rival commander - Abou Zeid - one of the most violent and radical figures in AQIM. More than most al Qaeda affiliates, AQIM is divided into often competing groups. Citing regional security officials,  Agence France Presse reported Belmoktar had been dismissed for \"continued divisive activities, despite several warnings.\" Libyan sources tell CNN that Belmokhtar spent several months in Libya in 2011, exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups, and securing weapons supplies. One Arab media report - cited in a US Federal Research Division report last year - said Belmoktar had attended an event organized by Wissam ben Hamid, an Islamist commander, in the town of Sirte. There is no way to verify that. More recently, his center of operations was the dusty town of Gao in northern Mali. Another offshoot of AQIM known as the Movement for Unity and Jihad has taken over Gao and introduced Sharia law, including public amputations and floggings. To make money, \"Belmoktar increasingly engaged in smuggling, earning the popular nickname 'Mr. Marlboro' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,\" Jean-Pierre Filiu in a 2010 Carnegie Paper. A wide theater . Criminality helped fund jihad. In December 2007, Belmoktar's followers murdered four French tourists in MaurItania.  Two months later, they carried out a drive-by shooting on the Israeli Embassy in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. \"We set an ambush to kill the ambassador of the Zionist entity in Mauritania before attacking the compound that housed the embassy and the nightclub that the ambassador was present in minutes before the attack,\" Belmoktar told a Mauritanian journalist in November 2011. Despite US satellite surveillance and the deployment of Algerian and MaurItanian troops to vulnerable areas, al Qaeda affiliates in the Sahel have grown in strength. The vast distances and empty landscapes - as well as a complex relationship with local tribes - play to their advantage. Borders are difficult to seal: the rugged Algerian-Malian frontier is as long as the distance from New York to Chicago. In February 2012, a cache of SAM missiles - looted from Libyan armories - was discovered buried in the desert not far from In Amenas. Andrew Lebovich says the weapons - SA-7 nd SA-24 \"seem to have been at a midway point in the delivery process,\" their destination and customer unknown. Many AQIM figures - Belmoktar and Abou Zeid included - know the region minutely. Indeed, Lebovich says some suspect that it was relatives of Abou Zeid who kidnapped a local Algerian official a year ago - bundling him across the border into Libya. In the view of one Libyan source with close contacts among the region's jihadists, Belmoktar has often been a thorn in the side of AQIM's leadership. \"He was seen as a loose canon, running things in his own way,\" the source told CNN recently. \"and the last thing the leadership wanted was to antagonize the United States just when it was trying to build up strength by stealth, below the radar.\" However the hostage stand-off is resolved, that strategy has now been blown to pieces."}]}

Frankel will stud at owner's Khalid Abdulla's Banstead Manor, which is part of his Juddemonte Farms group after leaving Warren Stables, the yard of trainer Henry Cecil last week. \"The fee for Frankel reflects his merits as being perhaps the greatest racehorse we have ever witnessed,\" said Juddmonte Farms' general manager Philip Mitchell on the firm's official website. \"He is by Galileo, who is now recognized as the best sire in the world, and out of Kind, a winner of six races (from five to seven furlongs) and herself a daughter of one of the most influential stallions in the history of thoroughbred breeding, Danehill.\" Fabulous Frankel: What made the thoroughbred so special . Frankel, named after American trainer Bobby Frankel who died three years ago, ended his career in perfect style at Ascot last month by winning the Champion Stakes.

Investigations carried out by security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve \u2018deleted\u2019 data from second-hand models of the device. Experts typically advise carrying out a factory reset to remove data from any gadget, but the investigation has revealed this technique may not always work on the supermarket\u2019s tablet. Investigations carried out security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve \u2018deleted\u2019 data from second-hand models of Tesco's Hudl tablet (pictured).\u00a0Using free software, a security expert obtained unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords, and browsing history . The investigations involved second-hand gadgets bought on auction sites, including eBay, and included 10 Hudls. Earlier this year, researchers from Avast found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean.

'If you sell or dispose of your device, we recommend you enable encryption on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand; this has been available on Android for over three years.' The BBC, with help from Ken Munro, security expert at Pen Test Partners, said the Hudl was vulnerable because of a bug in its Rockchip processor\u2019s firmware. Using free software, Mr Munro discovered that the flaw in the firmware meant he could read data stored on it, as well as write to it. He uncovered data including unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords and browsing history. Tesco said that devices returned to the stores have personal data wiped, and advised customers to use data wiping software, as well as carrying out a factory reset, to make sure the information is removed. Sven Boddington, vice president of global marketing and client solutions at computer firm Teleplan told MailOnline: \u2018To say it's worrying to find tablet devices are being sold with data still on them is an understatement. \u2018This is not the first instance, we\u2019re constantly seeing this kind of story in the news. \u2018It\u2019s not good enough to delete the personal data to only a \u2018basic standard\u2019 or worse still, not at all as there is an obligation to comply with data protection laws.\u2019 Earlier this year, researchers from Avast found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary Instagram Wednesday announced new policies aimed at stemming online sales of illegal guns. The social media platforms have agreed to remove reported posts that evade gun laws, restrict minors under the age of 18 from viewing posts about firearm sales and provide education to better inform law-abiding sellers of guns. \"By taking these unprecedented educational and enforcement efforts, we've been able to strike an important balance in helping people express themselves, while promoting a safe and responsible community,\" Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, said at a news conference. The new rules come after campaigns by gun safety organizations nationwide have pushed for stricter controls on the sale of firearms. Moms Demand Action, an organization devoted to gun-control reforms, started on a Facebook page in December 2012, shortly after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The organization lobbies for more restrictive gun policies that protect the safety of children and families. Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts said more than 230,000 Americans signed the group's petition, tweeted or used other social media to ask Facebook and Instagram to crack down on online sales. The organization last year campaigned for Starbucks to ban guns in stores, resulting in an open letter by CEO Howard Schultz telling customers to leave guns at home. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the largest gun violence prevention group, which was founded by former Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston, discussed the issue with Facebook officials. \"People are logging onto the Internet and signing into what has become, unfortunately, a virtual gun show,\" John Feinblatt, chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a conference call Wednesday. In November, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman joined efforts to persuade Facebook and Instagram to issue new gun rules. \"Responsible social media sites know that it is in no one's interest for their sites to become a 21st century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. Facebook already prohibits ads for the sale of guns or ammunition, said Bickert, adding that the new rules will strengthen that policy. Neither Facebook nor Instagram are e-commerce sites, but both facilitate conversation and provide an open marketplace that makes it possible to exchange information promoting weapons sales. Gun sales listed by site users talked about \"no background check required\" or said \"will cross state lines,\" Feinblatt said. Law enforcement officers and advocacy groups will have a direct connection to Facebook to flag posts that may promote this illegal activity, officials said."}]}

Sydney's temperatures are expected to surge past 31 degrees this weekend, with thunderstorms developing throughout the day. Other capital cities, Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth, will reach highs of 30 degrees over the week.

Wild weather has caused chaos across Australia's southern states with an electrical storm taking over the sky in Adelaide on Sunday night . Severe weather warnings were issued as thunderstorms swept across South Australia and Victoria late on Sunday, with the electrical storm causing thousands of homes to lose power and major delays to public transport. Around 3000 homes in Sydney's west lost power on Monday evening, after winds brought down power-lines and trees,\u00a0Nine News\u00a0reports. In Paddington, east of Sydney, a tree collapsed and crushed several cars from the strong winds that  occurred during the day. Across Sydney, State Emergency Service crews assisted  40 different wild weather reports. A family were forced to flee their home in Prahran, south-east of Melbourne's CBD, early on Monday morning after a lightening strike started a fire. Severe weather warnings were issued as thunderstorms swept across South Australia . The family of five were woken by the fierce electrical storm about 2am before they heard a loud crash, smelt smoke and saw their home going up in flames. It took about two hours to contain the blaze as neighbouring houses were forced to evacuate. A witness, Andrew, told 3AW the fire looked 'very fierce'. 'We all thought lightning actually went through the house because it was blown apart,' he said. The incredible lightening strikes sent social media into a frenzy with a number of photos capturing the bolts . Severe weather warnings were issued for several areas, including Eastern Eyre Peninsula, Lower Eyre Peninsula and parts of the West Coast .

India's science and technology minister, Jitendra Singh, described the cyclone as \"very severe\" but not as threatening as a \"super cyclone.\" Hudhud is expected to intensify and peak to around 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) by Sunday afternoon, Singh said. But Singh downplayed the intensity of the storms, asking people \"not to get unduly alarmist.\" At least 100,000 residents from four districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh were moved to safer locations, such as schools and other structurally strong buildings, according to authorities. Many others will be shifted Sunday well before the storm's landfall, Andhra Pradesh's disaster-management commissioner, A.R. Sukumar, told CNN. In neighboring Odisha state, another 100,000 people have also been evacuated, according to a senior emergency official. \"We are confident damage will be minimum,\" said Kamal Lochan Mishra, an Odisha disaster-management official. The Indian military has mobilized its resources to areas vulnerable to Hudhud, defense officials said. In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about the government's plans to prepare for and recover from the surging storm, according to a statement from Modi's office.

Mark Faird will live in an art gallery in London comprising a bed and bathroom area and will not remove the Oculus Rift headset for the duration of the exhibition. The 'Seeing-I' exhibit is intended to raise questions of intimacy, surveillance and voyeurism in the world today using virtual reality technology. A British artist plans on wearing a virtual reality headset for 28 days in a confined space to experience life through another person\u2019s eyes. Mark Faird (pictured) will live in an art gallery comprising a bed and bathroom area and will not remove the Oculus Rift headset for the duration of the exhibition . The social-artistic experiment will be overseen by a psychologist because no-one has ever worn a virtual reality headset for so long in one stint and there are health concerns. \u2018For 24 hours a day for 28 days, artist Mark Farid will wear a virtual reality headset through which he will experience life through another person\u2019s eyes and ears - this person will be referred to as \u2018the other\u2019, according to the Kickstarter website. The artist is raising cash on the crowd funding website to make the exhibition possible. \u2018For 24 hours a day for 28 days, artist Mark Farid will wear a Virtual Reality Headset through which he will experience life through another person\u2019s eyes and ears - this person will be referred to as \u2018the other\u2019, according to the Kickstarter website. He is shown sleeping in an Oculus Rift headset, in a test run . He will have no previous relationship with the person through whom he will experience the world, but will be aware that \u2018the other\u2019 is a heterosexual male, who is in a relationship. \u2018The other\u2019 person living outside the gallery,  will have to wear a pair of glasses that covertly capture audio and video. This footage will then be watched back by Mr Faird, who will inhabit a space consisting of only a bed, a toilet and shower area, and will be on constant display to the public apart from one hour after he goes to sleep. Mark Faird (pictured) will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what \u2018the other\u2019 eats and shower when \u2018the other\u2019 showers, for example . During this time, a psychologist will check on Mr Faird\u2019s welfare and the headset will also act as a \u2018verbal diary\u2019 to capture his mental health, the website says. The artist will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what \u2018the other\u2019 eats and shower when \u2018the other\u2019 showers, for example. Presumably the artist will see the most intimate details of the 'other's' life through his eyes. The team of artists and video directors behind the project write: \u2018Over the course of the project, it will become apparent whether Mark will begin to lose his own sense of self, and start to inhabit the reality of the other.\u2019 \u2018With no one to talk to, and no one to validate any of Mark\u2019s thoughts, will his only source of validation - the other\u2019s life - become the life which makes sense to Mark?\u2019 The artist could alternatively retain his own sense of self and exist in a strange \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 they explained. The findings of the arty experiment will be made into a documentary which will include commentary by psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, philosophers and artists. So far the group of artists behind the project have raised just over \u00a32,000 of their ambitious \u00a3150,000 goal, with 29 days to go. The exhibition seeks to find out whether the artist will lose his sense of self and experience life though another person\u2019s eyes. The end result of the experiment is unknown to everyone, and has the potential for a variety of implications to the artist\u2019s physical and mental health. A psychologist will check on Mark Faird\u2019s health throughout the 28 days and if he is not coping it will be cut short. His physical and mental health will be constantly monitored to ensure his eyesight is not harmed by wearing a virtual reality headset for so long, for example. He is undergoing sessions with a psychologist in preparation for this project so it is possible to assess how the project has affected him."}]}

Her remains were spotted by a dog walker in woods on farmland near Anmer, about a mile from the main gate to Sandringham House. Following forensic tests, police identified the victim, who went missing from her home in August. Alisa's family said they were 'devastated' at the news. Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry, senior investigating officer in the case, said: 'Family Liaison Officers have been sent to meet with close family this morning to provide the update. 'I shall now be liaising with officers from Cambridgeshire who have been working on trying to locate Alisa in recent months as a missing person. 'The information they provide will give me and the team an extra focus to the inquiry. 'I should also add we are still trying to establish any activity which took place on or around the site during the timeframe of the end of August to the end of September 2011.

One of about 30 protesters who had been on hunger strike in an eastern Ukrainian city over pension cuts died on Sunday night after police broke up their tent encampment, emergency services and the protest leader said. The group were survivors of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear accident and had been staging their protest in the mining city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine since November 14 after reductions in the state pensions they receive for their part in fighting the 1986 disaster. With temperatures hovering around zero, emergencies ministry workers had provided one large tent with heating for the core protesters to sleep in until the issue had been resolved. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lonely protest: Liquidators of the Chernobyl nuclear power station 1986's accident stand near a tent during a protest for better social treatment in the eastern industrial city of Donetsk . But after a court ruled the protest illegal late last week, police stormed into the main tent on Sunday night and removed a power generator, a stove and cut off lighting, the protest leader Nikolai Goncharov told reporters. In the ensuing disorder, 70-year-old Gennady Konoplyov was taken ill and died in an ambulance after the police operation, Goncharov said. \u2018The police attack on the tent city was an act of terrorism,\u2019 Goncharov said. The local emergency services said in a statement today the main tent had been taken down swiftly and it was shortly after the police operation had ended that they had been called to give help to Konoplyov. Konoplyov had earlier complained to local medical workers of pains in his chest, but had refused their advice to receive hospital treatment for heart trouble, the statement said. Trying to keep warm: Demonstrators sit beside a fire to try and warm up in zero degree temperatures in the Ukraine protest . Tragic ending: One of about 30 protesters who had been on hunger strike in an eastern Ukrainian city over pension cuts died last night . Emergency services said protesters had initially hindered the movement of the ambulance carrying Konoplyov last night. He died on his way to hospital, the statement said. The incident is a personal embarrassment for President Viktor Yanukovich. Donetsk is his home town and normally a loyal bastion of support for him and his Regions Party. \u2018All this has happened with the silent agreement of the guarantor of the Constitution, President Viktor Yanukovich of Ukraine. The death of our comrade will be on his conscience because the president arranged this mayhem,\u2019 Goncharov said. Attacked: A Chernobyl 'liquidator' reacts after his tent was attacked and destroyed by unknown persons in Donetsk . Injured demonstrators: Ukrainian veterans of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster or Chernobyl 'liquidators' carry their friend after their tent were disassemble by police officers . Reform of the ex-Soviet republic's bloated pensions system is one of the commitments that Yanukovich's government has had to make to the International Monetary Fund in return for a $15 billion (\u00a39.6bn) stand-by programme. It is dragging its heels, however, on another promise to the IMF to raise the price of household gas which it fears will dent the popularity of the Regions Party before a parliamentary election next October. The Chernobyl disaster-fighters, who were evacuated with their families from the northern region 25 years ago, have become a powerful action group against the government's austerity moves and regularly stage protests at the parliament building in the capital Kiev.
