According to an unnamed source quoted in The Guardian, the heir to the throne is \u2018ready to reshape the monarch\u2019s role\u2019 when he accedes to the throne. The newspaper claimed Charles wants to make \u2018heartfelt interventions\u2019 in national life, in stark contrast to his mother who rarely utters a word on matters of public debate \u2013 including September\u2019s Scottish referendum. Prince Charles (pixtured) will break with the Queen\u2019s habit of discretion when he becomes King and will continue to speak out on issues close to his heart, it was claimed today . The Prince frequently speaks his mind, often controversially, on issues that he feels passionately about such as the environment, farming, health, education and architecture. While some see his interventions as well-meaning, others \u2013 including some former ministers \u2013 have accused him of meddling. Next week the Supreme Court will rule on a legal battle by The Guardian to publish 27 of Charles\u2019s so-called \u2018black spider memos\u2019, correspondence sent by the Prince to ministers on a variety of issues affecting public life. Clarence House, backed by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, has argued that the Prince has a right to express his opinions and for those views to be kept secret in order to protect the monarchy\u2019s political neutrality. The Queen (pictured) rarely utters a word on matters of public debate \u2013 including September\u2019s Scottish referendum . But critics of the Prince say his \u2018meddling\u2019 and \u2018lobbying\u2019 over national affairs have put him in an invidious position. Now what the paper describes as a \u2018well-placed source\u2019 says of his future role: \u2018He will be true to his beliefs and contributions. 'Rather than a complete reinvention to become a monarch in the mould of his mother, the strategy will be to try and continue with his heartfelt interventions, albeit checking each for tone and content to ensure it does not damage the monarchy. \u2018Speeches will have to pass the following test: would it seem odd because the Queen wouldn\u2019t have said it or would it seem dangerous?\u2019 The paper also quotes Patrick Holden, an adviser to the Prince on sustainability, as saying: \u2018The Prince understands the need to be careful about how he expresses concerns\u2026but I do think he will keep doing exactly that.\u2019 Clarence House described the claims as \u2018speculative\u2019, but a spokesman added: \u2018The Prince of Wales cares deeply about this country and has devoted most of his working life to helping individuals and organisations to make a difference for the better.\u2019"}]}

A man who challenged himself to do one new thing every day of 2012 to raise money for charity after his wife lost their baby has announced she is expecting again. Richard Roberts, 31, started a blog detailing the one new thing he did every day of the last year - and asked readers to donate a penny for each new thing he did to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, after his wife Sian lost their first child. Richard Roberts decided to raise money for the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust after his wife Sian lost their first child. He started a blog detailing the one new thing he did each day of 2012 - here, trying Iranian food . Richard asked readers pf his blog to donate a penny for each new thing he did. Here, being bench-pressed by a friend . After a year of completing tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous - ranging from conducting a philharmonic audience to eating a deep-fried Mars Bar - Richard has raised more than \u00a32,000 for the charity. And yesterday, on the 366th day of his blog, he touchingly announced he had become a dad-to-be, posting a scan of his unborn child. Richard, from Thatcham, Berks, started the blog after kissing his new wife Sian on New Years' Eve 2011 - and realised it was the first time he had kissed his wife in 2012. Down the hatch: Drinking Armadillo milk was another new experience, as was the Man vs Food challenge . He also rescued a piglet and spent a day flying a hawk . He explained on his blog: 'As we drunkenly ushered in the new year in Central London, I grabbed my beautiful wife and gave her a big, lickery kiss! As I did this, I realised I had never brought in the new year by kissing a wife before! 'In my drunken excitement, I informed my pals that I would bravely keep this up for the whole of 2012; trying something new everyday!' After Sian almost lost her life after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, Richard decided to use his resolution to help raise money for the charity which helped them through tough times. He said: 'By the time we got to the hospital Sian had lost so much blood, we were told she was just hours away from death. New acquaintances: Meeting newsreader Jon Snow on a train counted towards Richard's annual tally . The 366 tasks, which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous, even included a nappy changing contest . After his year of tasks, including trying archery, Richard has raised more than \u00a32,000 for charity . 'I would give anything to have avoided that fateful day. Sadly, that is not possible.' The resulting surgery meant Sian lost one of her fallopian tubes, diminishing the couple's chances of conceiving a baby in the future. Richard's new things ranged from simple deeds - like going to introduce himself to his next-door neighbours, or changing the dirty nappy of a friend's baby. But others were slightly more bizarre - including rescuing an escaped piglet at a children's farm, and chatting to broadcasting legend Jon Snow on the tube. He's also turned his hand to archery, and spent a day handling birds of prey at the Hawk Conservancy Trust. After trying a deep fried Mars Bar, engineer Richard posted: 'I had to have a shower after I finished...and I still felt unclean. Each mouthful took a day of my life.' One particular low point was the deep-friend Mars bar, every mouthful of which Richard described as 'taking a year off my life' Fortunately, his barbequed meat was more palatable . On January 8, he wrote: 'Finally got around to meeting our neighbours properly - Chris, Tracy & Joe. They ROCK!' and posted a photo of him with his new chums. And on May 14th he posted: 'On the train home, Sian and I sat next to the legendary broadcaster, Jon Snow. He had just spent the evening at a charity event at the Royal Albert Hall, in the company of Prince William and Kate. Hmmm. I expect me and Sian were a bit of a disappointment after that! 'Jon Snow was a genuinely lovely fella. I ended up booking him a taxi from Newbury Station - and boring him senseless with this little blog! He seemed startled and confused when I told him that that he was my 'new thing for the day!' But his thousands of followers were touched when on December 31, Richard wrote: 'Became an Expectant Dad! Today I am proud to announce that I'm a genuine, bona fide Father-to-be. And I could not be happier! Getting to grips with wrestling . Yesterday,on the 366th day of his blog, Richard announced he and Sian are expecting again . 'Please remember the reason for me embarking on this bonkers charity project; a few years ago, my wonderful wife, Sian, suffered an ectopic pregnancy. It took the life our wee baby, and it very nearly took my wife's life in the process. The subsequent surgery left my wife bereft on one of her fallopian tubes, thereby diminishing our chances of conceiving in the future. 'Although that fateful incident broke my heart, I was grateful that I still had my wonderful wife by my side! And we never gave up hope! 'And, as this post proves, I am glad we didn't give up- we are now expecting. We have a long way to go, so we aren't counting our chickens before they hatch, but we remain positive! 'If you have had a similar experience to my wife and me, I hope that this final new thing brings you hope too.' To see more of Richard's blog, visit: http://tinylittlefella.tumblr.com/ ."}]}

At least 14 people were killed and 52 others were wounded in two car bombs and a roadside bomb in two separate locations in eastern Baghdad's Sadr City, police said. The first car bomb was outside a busy restaurant; the second was followed by a roadside bomb near an outdoor market in the city, police added. Sadr City is a predominantly Shiite district. At least five Shiite pilgrims were killed when a roadside bomb in Taji, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Baghdad, struck a minibus carrying them to visit Al-Askariya, or the \"Golden Mosque.\" A dozen more were wounded in the blast. Police said most of the casualties were Iranian pilgrims. A roadside bomb exploded in an outdoor market in al-Mamel Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 13 others, police officials said. In the Sunni city of Mosul, five people were killed and seven more wounded in four attacks in and around the city, police said. Most of those affected were from the minority Shabak sect. The attacks included two shootings and two explosions targeting houses and shops related to the sect. On Saturday evening, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road in the al-Jihad neighborhood of western Baghdad, wounding four people. When police arrived to investigate and to evacuate the casualties, another roadside bomb detonated, killing one policeman and wounding two others, police said. In another incident, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Muqdadiya, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing one person and wounding six others, Baquba police said. Britain's ambassador to Iraq, Simon Collis, condemned as \"cowardly\" Saturday's attacks. The top U.N. envoy in Iraq, also condemned the attacks, some of which he said had targeted worshipers. \"This is an atrocious act of violence against innocent worshipers of various faiths,\" said Martin Kobler, the secretary-general's special representative and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. Last month, 365 people, including police and soldiers, were killed. It was the deadliest month since August 2010. Twin blasts kill 11 in Iraq ."}]}

Official figures show more than 80 Britons die from the diseases every day \u2013 70 per cent higher than the European average. Overall, some 138 people in every 100,000 in the UK die from \u2018respiratory diseases\u2019 \u2013 including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma \u2013 every three years. This works out at 88,000 people \u2013 or 29,000 a year. Britain has the worst record in Europe for deaths from respiratory diseases like flu and pneumonia . Nine out of 10 people who die from flu and other respiratory diseases are over 65, according to the EU report \u2013 suggesting some 26,000 British pensioners die from the preventable diseases every year. The EU said poor public health campaigns warning the elderly to get vaccinated against flu was to blame for countries suffering high death rates. In 2011 the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley scrapped the annual flu vaccination advertising campaign to encourage pensioners to get the jab. After a spike in deaths the Department of Health u-turned \u2013 reintroducing the yearly campaign. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: \u2018These figures are deeply worrying and shows us just how far there is to go to get care right for older people with poor respiratory health or at high risk from infections such as the flu. \u2018It is vital we ensure the health service is geared up to meet the needs of frail older people and those living with long term conditions and help them stay as well as possible especially as winter approaches.\u2019 Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s Shadow Health Minister, said old age deaths because they could not afford to heat their homes was a national scandal. Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Heat your home to at least 18C . If heating the whole house is a problem heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep . Have your flu jab to protect yourself  from influenza . Look out for friends, relatives and neighbours who may be vulnerable to the cold . Watch the weather forecast and plan ahead . Have regular hot meals and drinks . Get financial support to make your home more energy efficient . Have your heating and cooking appliances checked regularly . Wear a few layers of thin clothing rather than one thick layer . When you need to go outside wear shoes with slip resistant, good grip soles . Mr Gwynne said: \u2018Older people living in cold homes is a scandal and we must put an end to it. \u2018Labour's promise to stand up to the energy companies and freeze bills will help to protect older people from poor health.\u2019 Former industrial areas and countries where lots of people smoke are also likely to suffer higher flu and pneumonia death rates. The Brussels report said men were almost twice as likely to die from the diseases. Public Health England confirmed that Britain was the worst record for flu and pneumonia in Europe according to Brussels' official figures. Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at PHE, said: 'Although attempts are made to standardise coding of deaths, it\u2019s important to exercise caution when comparing country to country figures like this, due to systematic differences in the way clinicians complete death certificates. 'While these figures suggest UK has a high rate of respiratory death, it also says UK has one of the lowest rates for circulatory deaths, and it is not possible to conclude from these figures alone that the UK has had a higher burden of disease due to influenza' The Government was attacked earlier this week over official advice for pensioners to protect against the cold this winter. The Public Health England document said struggling pensioners should only turn on the heating in one room to stay warm this winter. The new guidance urges those struggling to pay their heating bills to only warm their living room during the day and their bedroom at night. A hot water bottle should also be taken to bed, according to Public Health England. Other 'top tips' to drive down winter deaths include wearing slippers, keeping out the cold with lots of thin layers of clothes \u2013 and having regular hot meals and cups of tea throughout the day. According to the report the elderly should heat their homes to at least 18C during the winter to protect their health. Last year's cold weather saw 31,100 excess deaths in Britain, mainly among over\u201375s. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and his Labour opposite number Andy Burnham (right) clashed in the Commons over the NHS today, amid warnings that the health service needs \u00a38billion more funding . Dot Gibson, National Pensioners' Convention general secretary, said: 'Every year, we get the same sort of message from public health officials. But the number of older people dying from cold\u2013related illnesses is on the rise. 'Putting on an extra jumper or walking around a bit more than usual doesn't really address the fact that fuel bills continue to go up way in excess of people's pensions. 'Warm words are nice \u2013 but a warm home is better.' The average household energy bill is now \u00a31,265 a year, \u00a353 more than a year ago. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, added: 'It is shocking that each winter an older person dies every seven minutes from cold weather. 'Turning up the heating is not an option for many older people struggling with high bills.' But Dr Angie Bone, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at Public Health England, said thousands of lives could be saved if people followed the Government's advice. The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk. Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week. However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening. Those at risk include: . Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. The flu vaccine is given free of charge to: . The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November. For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store. Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'"}]}

More than a quarter of MPs have billed the taxpayer for first-class rail travel in the past year - despite a supposed crackdown on the practice. A study of MPs' expenses yesterday revealed that 185 had claimed for first-class rail tickets rather than travel in standard class. Those involved include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Cabinet Office Minister Norman Baker, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. George Osborne in First Class on the train from Wilmslow to London with his aide watching a DVD . The claims were made by 113 Labour MPs, 48 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, three Scottish National Party and two Plaid Cymru members. Ten members of Ed Miliband\u2019s front-bench team are among the Labour claimants. The findings came as the Government tried to play down embarrassment over Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s decision to travel in a first-class carriage after purchasing a standard ticket on Friday. His office insisted he had always intended to pay for the upgrade and that an aide had sought out the train manager to do so. He is alleged to have found himself in the same situation in May, when he was also caught with a standard ticket in First Class. However, on that occasion he is said to have refused to pay the upgrade and instead 'slummed it' with ordinary travellers in economy class for the rest of the journey between London and his constituency in Tatton, Cheshire. A commuter who was on the train in May told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mr Osborne was confronted in first class by an inspector. The official seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing but quite correctly he treated Mr Osborne like anyone else. 'After a short discussion Mr Osborne gathered up his things and moved to a different carriage and slummed it with everyone else. 'I was a bit shocked to see the Chancellor trying to blag a cheap seat. I'd have thought with the money he has that he could afford the ticket.' The Chancellor faced embarrassment after being caught in the First Class carriage with the wrong ticket . After getting off the train George Osborne was confronted by journalists who had seen a string of tweets about the fiasco . But a television reporter travelling . on the same train claimed that the aide had actually got into a . confrontation with an inspector over whether he should have moved to . standard. According to . The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s analysis, some of the first-class ticket claims . have cost as much as \u00a3300, five times as much as the cheapest standard . fare for the same route. Ipsa's . guidelines on travel expenses suggest MPs should consider \u2018value for . money\u2019 and whether cheaper, inflexible tickets will end up costing more . if travel arrangements change at short notice. \u2018You can claim for first-class travel if it is less than the cost of a standard open fare,\u2019 it states. First-class tickets purchased far . enough in advance can end up cheaper than open standard tickets bought . shortly before the journey. But . Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: \u2018If MPs can . get themselves organised to order a first-class ticket in advance, they . should be able to order a standard-class ticket in plenty of time as . well and it will almost always be cheaper. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, left, and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, right, are among the MPs who have travelled first-class on trains and claimed the cost on expenses . \u2018If standard-class travel isn't good enough for MPs, it isn't good enough for ordinary commuters who pay for their own tickets.\u2019 George . Osborne was forced to hand over nearly \u00a3200 by a railway ticket . inspector during his trip on the 3.11pm Virgin Trains service from . Wilmslow, Cheshire, to London Euston this week. Rachel Townsend, a journalist with Granada TV, tweeted from the train: \u2018Very interesting train journey to Euston Chancellor George Osborne just got on at Wilmslow with a STANDARD ticket and he has sat in FIRST CLASS. \u2018His aide tells ticket collector he cannot possibly move and sit with the likes of us in standard class and requests he is allowed to remain in First Class. Ticket collector refuses.\u2019 Her account was disputed by sources close to Mr Osborne, who insisted there was never any question of him not paying for the upgrade \u2013 and it came to \u00a3189.90 for the two tickets. The source said: \u2018The Chancellor got a different train than planned due to a diary change following a series of meetings in his constituency. \u2018As he had no seat reservation on the new train which was crowded, he decided to upgrade \u2013 and obviously intended and was happy to pay. An aide sorted the ticket upgrade.\u2019"}]}

They do not just look beautiful either. All umbellifers attract into the garden beneficial insects like ladybirds, hoverflies and lacewings, which in turn are your best defence against aphids.

Birds too are attracted in autumn by the seeds, so they instantly enrich the wildlife of your garden. Q When should I trim my box hedge? Doreen Osborn, West Sussex . A Right now! The traditional date was Derby Day, which is at the end of the first week in June. In practice, this is after the risk of frost has safely passed, so depending where you live, any time between the beginning of May and end of June is ideal. This gives time for new growth to harden off before the autumn frosts. Q Half of my 25-year-old Leyland cypress 'Castlewellan' has turned brown. Is this a disease or old age? Jim Henry, Jedburgh, Scottish Borders . A It is not age \u2013 at 25 your plants\u00a0 are babies \u2013 nor is\u00a0 it disease. It is the cypress aphid, which sucks sap from the trees, causing the foliage to die back. The plants can recover and regrow \u2013 but often do not.

Why is this happening? Mrs M Wincott, Lancashire . A This could be petal blight, which is encouraged\u00a0 by excess moisture and poor ventilation.

Please include your full name and address. We regret Monty can't reply to letters personally . Many umbellifers add a tall, even stately element to the garden, whether growing in a border or 'wild' at the fringes. Mind you, some are taller than others. My White Garden that I made last year is based upon the spirit of cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), which froths so gloriously along our verges in May. By now it has all but disappeared but there are plenty of good garden plants that capture its free, floating spirit. Ammi majus is perhaps the most exact garden version and it is at its very best right now. It is a biennial that is best sown in September, so it's a good idea to order your seeds now. Keep it over the winter with a bit of protection (a cold frame is ideal) and then plant it out in spring, when it will grow to about 1-1.3m (3-4ft) topped with clean white florets. The only drawback that I have so far discovered is that it can be irresistible to rabbits. Orlaya grandiflora, the white lace flower, is a superb and graceful annual with rather larger flower heads that can be sown either in spring for flowering in late summer or in September for an earlier display the following year.\u00a0 It will flower continuously for about ten weeks so is excellent value in any border. Angelica grows huge on my damp, rich soil. It self-seeds vigorously so needs thinning if it is not to become too invasive, but in its right place it is an absolute joy. No plant is more popular with butterflies, hoverflies, bees and wasps than the lovely, plum-coloured umbellifer Angelica gigas. It starts out slowly, easing itself into summer with modest foliage, but in late July it throws up a 2m (6ft)-tall crimson stem topped with a beautiful bud that opens to reveal umbellifer flowers of the deepest burgundy. You can buy it to plant out now \u2013 it is monocarpic, which means that it dies back once it has set seed, but the seeds will produce a rash of seedlings that can be lifted and moved to wherever you wish to place them, so the plant can live on through its offspring for years. I grow Valeriana officinalis in a pot but it is a spectacular plant nevertheless, which deserves \u2013 and gets from me \u2013 pride of place. The white umbels are touched with pink and carried on tall, upright stems that last for months. The roots are apparently irresistible to cats and rats but the leaves are a sedative for humans. The common fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) exemplifies all the virtues of umbellifers: open, lacy, towering but not shading anything beneath it. The leaves are the perfect accompaniment to baked or barbecued fish and the seeds are delicious too, both rubbed into a joint of pork and to munch on by the handful. Good for the tummy too. Finally, one of my favourite umbellifers is sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata), which grows in quite deep shade. As with fennel, you can buy it to plant out now, and all of it can be eaten, from root to flower to seed. It tastes of aniseed and is good cooked with tart fruits such as rhubarb or gooseberries because it reduces the acidity."}]}

A university lecturer has apologised to the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after taking ecstasy tablets he'd left stashed in his home during an unsupervised party. Isobel Jones-Reilly, known as Issy, took two or three pills at the party at a west . London townhouse owned by university lecturer Brian Dodgeon on Easter Saturday in April . 2011. A group of young partygoers found a secret drugs stash - including ecstasy, LSD and ketamine - hidden by the academic, who was a lecturer at the Institute of Education at the time, in a whisky container in a wardrobe cupboard in his bedroom. Mr Dodgeon today broke down in tears as he apologised to the parents of Isobel for leaving the drugs in the house - claiming he didn't believe he was being irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised as there was a '0.1 per cent' chance of his illegal narcotics being found. Tragedy: Isobel Reilly, 15, pictured left, died in April 2011 after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the home of Brian Dodgeon, pictured right leaving the hearing, and Angela Hadjipateras . Cleared: Brian Dodgeon, pictured with partner Angela Hadjipateras, was given an eight month suspended sentence for drug possession after Isabel's death. The couple have been told they will not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter . At an inquest into her death, he turned to Isobel's parents in the front row and said: 'I am so sorry about what happened. 'All I can say was at the time I didn't feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.' His voice cracked and he wiped away a . tear as he added: 'In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all . and I made that decision.' But Dodgeon refused to accept it was . 'blindingly obvious' he should not have left his house unsupervised to . attend another party in Hastings with his partner Angela Hadjipateras that night. He said: 'At the time, it didn't seem . likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start . systematically looking through the drawers. 'There was a 0.1 per cent chance of . anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that . someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes . a fire and people die.' Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where he kept drugs but insisted they would be 'virtually impossible' for the teenagers to find . Addressing Mr Dodgeon, Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox . said: 'Isn't it blindingly obvious 14 to 15-year-olds are very likely . to take the opportunity to misbehave and to really push the boundaries, . and you should not have left them unsupervised.' Dodgeon said the teenagers usually . invited to his home for parties did not appear to be big drinkers, and . the idea they were look for his drug stash never occurred to him. 'I had never had the experience of our bedroom being used by anyone but Angela and myself', he said. 'At none of the other parties had . anyone gone into our bedroom, even a party that was unsupervised until . 3am - it was a no go area.' He added: 'I didn't think that people . would go through our drawers in our bedroom, I didn't think anyone . would go into our bedroom at all. 'You would have to go through 15 drawers before exhausting all the convenient drawers to look through.' The inquest has heard at previous . parties at his home, a teenage girl had to be put to bed for being too . drunk and there had been cannabis smoking. But Mr Dodgeon said: 'There had never . been evidence of drug taking and never serious problems with people . getting drunk and being sick, or having to be driven home. 'It seemed to me from parties that we had supervised, people would sneak in very small beers or cider.' The lecturer said the teenagers . appeared to be 'polite and studious', adding: 'At that time, I felt that . party was going to be safe. 'I felt it was important to occasionally demonstrate a degree of trust to that generation of kids, I felt it would show trust. 'I really did not think that people would search the bedroom.' Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets . Mr Dodgeon previously admitted four counts of . drugs possession when he appeared in court after Issy\u2019s death and was . sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years in December . 2011. The  lecturer . was today told at the hearing . he would not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter over the . pills being 'readily accessible'. Dr Wilcox said: 'It has been decided there are no further prosecutions that can be brought.' Dodgeon's partner Angela Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed his drug stash was 'virtually impossible' for the . partying teenagers to find. Ms Hadjipateras admitted she knew her . partner of 27 years was a recreational drug user, but she did not want . to know where they were hidden in the house. She . told the inquest Dodgeon regularly smoked marijuana or hash cannabis, . and was aware he had taken LSD and ecstasy in the past. Dudgeon only confessed where his drug . stash was hidden, inside a whisky bottle in the bedroom closet, when . they drove back from Hastings following Isobel's death. 'I knew he had hash and marijuana, . and that that had, I can't remember dates, but I know I had asked him if . he had any ecstasy or other drugs', she said. Mourning: Friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7C after taking the drugs . 'If he had anything in his possession, he said I wouldn't have to worry about it, they would be very well concealed.' Ms Hadjipateras said Dodgeon moved . his whisky tin of drugs to different places round the house, often . picking hiding places which were 'high up'. She said she had 'deduced' he would . have drugs in the house because she knew he used them, but added: 'I . chose not to find out where it was.' She told the inquest: 'On the way home from Hastings, he told me. He told me that there were drugs hidden in the top cupboard. 'It was in the early stages, before . we knew what had happened, and he said it was virtually impossible it . could have been drugs in the house that would have been the ones. 'He said we couldn't have any problems with any of the kids finding them. 'He told me he had them right at the back of the cupboard, they were in our bedroom in the top cupboard. 'He told me that there was LSD ecstasy, and that there was a very small amount of ketamine.' Asked . by the coroner why she had not tried to find the drugs, Ms Hadjipateras . said: 'I believed that Brian is extremely responsible, and that if he . told me they were extremely well hidden, I preferred not to know.' Ms . Hadjipateras admitted 'eight or nine' teenage parties had been held at . their home prior to Isobel's death, although this was the first to be . unsupervised. Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell . She had . been forced to help a drunk teenage girl at a previous party, and . accepted it was 'not totally outrageous' that drug taking, drinking, and . underage sex could take place at a party. 'Isn't that why you would generally supervise the parties, because of the risk that something can go wrong?', asked Dr Wilcox. 'Surely . it is absolutely barn door obvious the risk of alcohol, cannabis, and . teenage behaviour is more likely to go up if the party is unsupervised.' Ms Hadjipateras said she had asked a neighbour to be 'on call' during the party in case of emergency. She . added: 'When I weighed up whether it was wise or unwise to go and leave . the kids at the party, I heard the views of a number of people whose . children are the same age, I came to the conclusion it was a manageable . risk.' Shortly after taking the drugs, Issy began hallucinating and frothing at the mouth, the hearing was told. But her friends only called an ambulance when . she collapsed and started shaking - about an hour after she took the . pills. When paramedics arrived at the house . in leafy Kensington, west London, her temperature had soared to 41.7C - . compared to the normal body temperature of 37C, Westminster Coroner's . Court heard. Issy was taken to St Mary's Hospital, but she died later that morning. Professor Robin Braithwaite, a . forensic toxicology expert based at King's College in London, said Issy . could have survived if she had been taken to hospital before her . temperature had risen so dangerously out of control after she took the . drugs. He said: 'That is a very high . temperature. The start of irreversible death is something like 42C, a . temperature of 41C is very high. 'It may have been possible that she . would have survived had help been summoned earlier when her temperature . was not quite so high and she was unwell. 'There are cases reported where hyperthermia can be treated. 'The earlier help is sought, before . the temperature rose to those high levels, it may have been possible had . she been admitted to hospital that treatment could have been given to . try and lower her temperature.' He said even with a temperature of 40C or 41C it is 'possible' she could have survived. The 15 year-old suffered from . suspected hyperthermia, brought on by taking two to three ecstasy . tablets which were of 'high' purity, the inquest heard. Cause of death was given as ingestion of MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy. Two other teenagers, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also took pills at the party and were taken to hospital. The inquest continues."}]}

Let's make sure this type of tragedy never happens again. And how do we know that was really Beyonce? Maybe it was a hologram or a body double!\" The above are just the (slightly) exaggerated responses of some in the cybersphere to the revelation that Beyonce Knowles might have lip-synced all or part of the national anthem at Monday's presidential inauguration. There are simply too many people in this country who go from zero to (faux) outrage in a matter of nanoseconds. Just look at Twitter and you will see the overuse of capital letters by people who feel CHEATED and ROBBED by the possibility of Beyonce's prerecorded performance. The U.S. Marine Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for Beyonce, is neither confirming nor denying that she lip-synced to a prerecorded track, although earlier a spokeswoman said the pop star \"did not actually sing.\" The Marine Band did explain that Beyonce, like all singers at the inauguration, made a recording of the song she was scheduled to sing which would be played \"in case of freezing temperatures, equipment failure or extenuating circumstances.\" To be honest, if Beyonce did lip sync the entire song she should be nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding acting in a TV Special, because it looked amazingly real. And I worked at \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2004 when Ashlee Simpson had her infamous lip-syncing meltdown so I have seen up close the horrors of bad lip-syncing. It's not that I'm unsympathetic to those who wanted to experience Beyonce singing live. There's truly no substitute for live performances. (Although on nights when I'm tired, I wish I could lip-sync some of my jokes to a prerecorded track, but alas, that's not allowed in my field -- yet.) And true, Kelly Clarkson sang a great version of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" live at the inauguration. However, to those outraged by the thought of Beyonce's possible lip-syncing, you need to keep a few things in mind. First, there's no dispute that was Beyonce's voice we heard. This isn't a Milli Vanilli type scandal where a singer lip-synced to songs actually sung by others. Secondly, performing to prerecorded tracks has been done at previous presidential inaugurals as well as at other big outdoor events because of audio concerns posed by weather conditions or technical issues. Indeed, at President Obama's 2009 inauguration, music legend Yo-Yo Ma mimicked playing his cello to a prerecorded track because the frigid weather would have made it too difficult to play live in tune. And at the 2012 Olympic games in London, the majority of musical performances in the opening and closing ceremonies were performed to prerecorded tracks, including ones by iconic bands like The Who and the Rolling Stones, because of acoustic issues with the outdoor venue. (Audience members were told well in advance that some songs would not be performed live.) Obviously, this is not an uncommon practice in special situations. Plus, this is clearly different than if people had paid to see Beyonce in concert and she lip-synced most, if not all, of her songs. That would have been wrong, just as it was when Britney Spears did it during her 2009 tour. In fact, Britney's overuse of lip-syncing so angered people in Australia that lawmakers there actually considered passing a law requiring that concertgoers be informed if parts of a show will be lip-synced. Beyonce hasn't responded about whether she did lip-sync. If she did, it could have been for a very valid reason, such as concerns about the weather or acoustics, or maybe nerves -- even superstars must get a little nervous when they see a crowd of close to a million people. Unfortunately for Beyonce, this issue will not go away quickly, because she's scheduled to perform in less than two weeks during the Super Bowl halftime show. There's no doubt reporters will hound her regarding whether she will be singing live or not. But to me, the real question people should be asking is: Who is going to win the Super Bowl? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah."}]}

But . they were left angry when the dealership quoted her \u00a314,600 to fix the car, . before another garage eventually solved the problem for just . \u00a31,000. Alan Thompson and Liz Moulton were left angry when they were given a \u00a315,000 repair bill after Mr Thompson accidentally put the wrong fuel in her Porsche Cayenne . Mr Thompson said: 'I wanted to take it back with a full tank. She drove off and I had no idea there was a problem. 'It is a common and very easy mistake to make when especially when you get to my age, when one frequently makes mistakes. 'We all make mistakes but I do object to being ripped-off to such a ludicrous extent by Porsche who I have found to be unsympathetic, inefficient and unhelpful.' The dealership Mrs Moulton originally took the car to in Stratford, East London, said the Porsche needed new fuel pumps, fuel lines, a fuel distributor, pressure regulator and sensor, six high pressure injectors, a fuel hose and even a replacement fuel tank - quoting her \u00a314,60 for the work. Mr Thompson then got quotes from other official Porsche dealers and found their prices ranging from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000. But he eventually found a garage who would solve the problem it for \u00a31,000 - and Mr Thompson has accused Porsche of trying to rip him off. Mr Thompson wanted to say thank you to Ms Moulton by returning the car with a full tank after he borrowed it for a weekend . Mrs Moulton has forgiven her friend the blunder, but is angry at Porsche for trying to charge her nearly \u00a315,000 to solve a problem which eventually cost \u00a31,000 to fix . Mr Thompson, who drives a Mercedes, says a local Mercedes dealer told him they charge \u00a3450 when it happens to their cars. The garage he ended up using carried out the work for just over \u00a31,000 - with the 4x4 not needing any of the new parts Porsche had listed. They removed the fuel, fitted a new fuel filter, filled it with a fuel flush detergent to clean out the remainder of the contaminated fuel and then filled it with the diesel. They charged him \u00a31,103 for parts, labour and VAT and the Cayenne is now running as it was before the mix-up. Mr . Thompson said: 'I'm happy as I'm over \u00a312,000 better off than if Liz had . had Porsche Stratford carry out the work as per their estimate of . \u00a313,169.24. 'Porsche should invest another \u00a320 on fitting a fail-safe device to their new vehicles as BMW, Ford and Land Rover do. The fuel cap cover is clearly labelled with the correct type of fuel, but Mr Thompson say Porsche should fit the cars with a device that prevents users filling up with the wrong kind . Mr Thompson is not alone in making the mistake, over 120,000 motorists fill up their car with the wrong fuel each year, prompting some manufacturers to fit safeguards . 'I am pretty sure that every potential buyer of a new Porsche diesel will be delighted to pay \u00a3100 for what I would regard as a must have option.' Mr Thompson, from Hadley Wood, North London, said Mrs Moulton was very understanding about his fuel blunder. Mrs Moulton said: 'I was dumbstruck when I was told the cost, I didn't know what to say or do. I couldn't be furious with Alan but I was furious with Porsche. I just thought \"for goodness sake\". 'Now the work has been carried out, the car is running brilliantly. I just think Porsche should be taken to task over this.' Porsche have defended the original quote they gave, insisting other parts of the engine would have become damaged and would have needed replacing . But . Porsche defended itself over the incident, saying the quote was . 'representative of the work that is recommended to be undertaken in this . situation'. A statement from the German manufacturer said: 'By not only filling the tank with petrol but also driving the vehicle with the wrong fuel, it is likely that the engine (in particular the fuel system) suffered considerable damage. 'As diesel fuel acts as both a lubricant and a fuel in a diesel engine, the contrasting solvent-effect of petrol could also have caused longer-term impact on the cylinders, valves, pistons etc. In short, it is highly damaging to the engine.' Porsche added its diesel vehicles are fitted with warning labels on the fuel flap and surrounding area which highlight 'very clearly' the type of fuel the car requires. Over 120,000 motorists fill their car with the wrong fuel each year and a number of manufacturers now having safeguards to prevent it from happening."}]}

Scroll down for video . Research: A new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas, an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives . Academics from Zurich University behind the study argue that other countries have changed the law, or at least had a serious debate about the issues, as a result of the rise in suicide tourism. However, British experts claim there has been little impact in the UK despite increasing numbers seeking help to die abroad. The Zurich Institute of Legal Medicine produced data on 611 cases of assisted suicide of non-Swiss people from 31 countries around the world during the five year period. The highest number was 268 Germans followed by 126 Britons \u2013 making two thirds of the total. The study, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, found in 2008 there were 123 cases of suicide tourism. This dipped to 86 cases in 2009 and increased steadily to 2012 when it reached 172 cases. Overall, 58.5 per cent of cases were women and the average age of those using these services was 69 - although the range was from 23 years to 97. There are six \u2018right to die\u2019 organisations operating in Switzerland offering assisted suicide to their members providing they meet certain criteria. Law: While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners (file photo) Four of these bodies offer services to foreign nationals, including people from the UK. These organisations deal with around 600 cases of suicide each year, some 150 to 200 of which are suicide tourists, the researchers found. Most cases of suicide tourism used Dignitas which charges between 9,000 to 10,500 Swiss francs (about \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000) for assisting suicide, says the study. Neurological diseases including paralysis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis were the most common reasons for assisted suicide - accounting for almost half of cases. Dr Charles Foster, of Green Templeton College at Oxford University, in a commentary in the journal, said there may be growing public acknowledgement of something \u2018intellectually, if not morally uncomfortable, about getting another country to do your dirty work\u2019. But, he said, this was not a reason for changing English law on assisted suicide. In the House of Lords, when he presented the Assisted Dying Bill, Lord Falconer said \u2018The current situation leaves the rich able to go to Switzerland, the majority reliant on amateur assistance, the compassionate treated like criminals. \u2018It is time for a change in the law but only a very limited and safeguarded change. \u2018It would not lead to more death but to less suffering.\u2019 The second reading of the Bill, which would offer the chance of assisted dying to terminally ill patients deemed mentally capable and within six months of likely death, took place in July and is to be moved to the next Parliamentary stage - the committee stage - at a date yet to be set. Other countries in the top 10 between 2008 and 2012 were France with 66 cases, Italy 44, USA 21, Austria 14, Canada 12, Spain and Israel (eight each)."}]}

Bush defended his administration's handling of the war in Afghanistan on Sunday, telling CNN that some NATO allies who contributed troops to the conflict \"turned out not to be willing to fight.\" In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush strongly refuted criticism that his administration took its \"eye off the ball\" in Afghanistan when he ordered troops to invade Iraq. He said he ordered American forces to overthrow Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein with the assumption that allied forces would help make up the difference in Afghanistan. \"What happened in Afghanistan was that our NATO allies, some of them, turned out not to be willing to fight,\" Bush said. \"Therefore, our assumption that we had ample troops -- U.S. and NATO troops -- turned out to be a not-true assumption. So we adjusted.\" The former president didn't name any countries specifically from NATO, which includes 28 nations in Europe and North America. Some 785 military personnel from NATO countries besides the United States have been killed in Afghanistan since hostilities began in October 2001, with the United Kingdom, Canada and France having the most fatalities. The comments by the 43rd U.S. president, along with those of his brother and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, aired during a CNN special, \"Bush: Two Years Later.\" The former president addressed a host of matters in the interview, which came days after the release of his 481-page memoir, \"Decision Points,\" and two days ahead of the groundbreaking for his presidential library and museum on Southern Methodist University's campus in Dallas, Texas. Bush said he \"felt terrible\" that weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq, despite the administration's persistent and insistent case that Saddam Hussein had them before the invasion. But while he took responsibility for the big push on and subsequent lack of WMDs, the former president said he still thought the Iraq war was justified. \"If (Saddam Hussein) was in power today, the world would be a lot worse off,\" he said. \"I believe that a free Iraq will be transformative in the Middle East.\" Bush said he had no regrets, too, about his decision near the end of his second term to push the 2008 federal bailout that loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to companies including AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America and General Motors. President Barack Obama later successfully pressed to use billions more in federal funds to buttress the U.S. economy, as it struggled through what's been called \"The Great Recession\" marked by high unemployment and rounds of foreclosures in a percolating real estate crisis. \"I set aside my free market principles and made a very difficult decision,\" Bush said. \"I believe that those decisions ... did prevent the economy from heading into a depression.\" Bush said he was dismayed when his administration's efforts to efforts to change the Social Security system -- an effort to control its costs -- failed to bear fruit. In late 2004 and early 2005, his administration laid out proposals to overhaul Social Security, in part by creating individual investment accounts that would act more like a traditional 401k and replace the current collective Social Security pool. But the plan floundered under pressure from Democrats and special interest groups such as the AARP, and Congress never even saw any formal legislation, much less voted on it. \"Not reforming Social Security was a huge disappointment,\" Bush said. Jeb Bush joined his brother for part of the CNN interview, saying he never publicly disagreed with George W. Bush when he was president and is \"not going to start now.\" Alluding to the hyperpartisanship in Washington, the former Florida governor said there's still room for civility in politics. \"I don't think you can be against everything, just because someone has a D (for Democrat) by their name and you have an R (for Republican) by your name,\" Jeb Bush said. George W. Bush said that he was mindful not to get involved in \"name calling\" as president, adding that he wasn't bothered when he was targeted. Bush said, too, that he didn't support Republicans challenging Democrats' patriotism just because they disagreed with them. \"I don't remember doing that personally, and that was uncalled for if that was the case,\" he said. \"Patriotic people disagreed with my decisions.\" One Democrat he has no qualms with is his Oval Office predecessor, Bill Clinton. Bush said he \"genuinely liked\" Clinton, whom he called one of his \"buddies,\" in part because he's been so \"gracious\" to his father, George H.W. Bush. iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . The Bush brothers both said Republicans' setbacks in recent election among Latinos -- which voted Democrat by a 2-to-1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party, with George W. Bush calling the situation \"un problemo.\" \"Part of it relates to tone,\" said Jeb Bush, saying some Latinos turned away from the Republican party when some of its members spoke strongly on illegal immigration. \"If they don't feel welcome, they're not going to listen to the message.\" Jeb Bush reiterated that he would not run for president -- like his brother and father -- in 2012. The former governor also said he did not want to head the national Republican party because he wanted to achieve \"some financial independence\" for himself and his family. The current GOP party chief, Michael Steele, has faced persistent criticism from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and others in recent months, even though Republicans scored big wins in the recent mid-term elections. As to speculation about Steele's future as the party's head, Jeb Bush opted not to wade into the party leadership debate, saying he was \"Switzerland in relation to national Republican politics.\" \"If I'm trying to achieve financial security for my family and I'm not running for office,\" Jeb Bush said. \"I certainly wouldn't run for RNC chairman.\" Jeb Bush said that he could see either or both of his sons, Jeb and George, following their father, their uncle, their grandfather and their great-grandfather (former Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut) by running for political office. But George W. Bush said he didn't see his daughters, twins Jenna and Barbara, who turn 29 this month, going into politics. \"They will be involved in helping improve people's lives,\" Bush said. \"But I doubt they'll ever run for public office.\" As to his own future, and legacy, Bush said he was content to let his memoir and his decisions speak for themselves. \"I'm not trying to shape my legacy,\" he said. \"I'm trying to provide data points for future historians.\""}]}

Just 24 hours after it was reported that Kim had ordered the machine-gun execution of his former singer lover, Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers, it was claimed today that hawkish army chief Kim Kyok-sik, 75, had been removed from his post, his future unknown. North Korean watchers in the hated South Korea said the sacking appeared to be an attempt by Kim, whose age is estimated to be about 30, to bring unruly and ageing military leaders to heel. General Kim Kyok Sik, right, stands with former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Although close to Jong Un, he has been removed from his post . But his ruthlessness appears to be paying off in his own country - according to researchers at Seoul University, the dictator now has a higher approval rating then both U.S President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Seoul-based North Korean analyst Daniel Pinkston, said yesterday that Kim had learned that he had to manage his dictatorship carefully if he wanted to stay in power. 'He is replacing officers appointed by his father, Kim Jong-il, with younger men who he hopes will now shore up his political power base.' Kim Kyok-sik does not go without leaving an impressive record of aggression behind - he is credited with masterminding the torpedo sinking of the South Korean Navy ship, Cheonan, and the shelling of the south's Yeonpyeong Island, both incidents occurring in 2010. Analysts said there was little doubt that Kim had been removed after studying a report in a North Korean newspaper, the official Rodong Sinmun daily. A source in the South Korean government said: 'We're closely watching development in the North, believing that Kim Kyok-sik has been replaced by Ri Yong-gil, the Army's General Staff chief of operations.' Execution: Kim Jong-Un, pictured with his wife Ri Sol-ju (left), also had Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers killed . The official said the North Korean paper had mentioned Ri Yong-gil behind senior regime figures Choe Ryong-hae and Jang Song-taek in a report about Kim watching a soccer match alongside selected soldiers. It mentioned Ri before Jang Jong-nam, the minister of the People's Armed Forces, but significantly there was no mention at all of Kim Kyok-sik, who was always photographed at Kim's side. In addition, Ri was seen with a four-star insignia rather than the three stars he displayed earlier, denoting his less senior post. 'Ri seems to have been promoted to chief of the Army's General Staff, because the chief of operations is never mentioned ahead of the Armed Forces minister,' said the source, quoted in Seoul's authoritative Chosn Ilbo newspaper, which revealed the alleged execution of Kim's former lover. Popular: Kim Jong-un, seen applauding during the final of the Torch Cup soccer tournament in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, has higher approval ratings than U.S President Barack Obama . According to the paper, Kim Kyok-sik's dismissal might have been discussed at a meeting of the Workers Party's Central Military Commission - chaired by none other than Kim Jong-un - last weekend. North Korean media reported that the meeting discussed 'organisational matters' and noted that the leader made an 'important decision.' The leader's ruthlessness has become apparent once again, because he held Kim Kyok-sik in high esteem - yet still felt the need to remove him. Analysts said it was possible that Kim Jong-un hopes the removal of the general might improve relations with South Korea and China - despite Beijing already being an ally. In spite of his ruthlessness, Kim is still supported by the majority of his people, according to research by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. Although not strictly accurate as they polled 133 North Korean defectors, researchers found that 61.7 per cent of those asked thought that the dictator had the backing of the majority of his country. According to the Telegraph, the result not only makes him\u00a0 more popular than his predecessor and late father, but also U.S President barack Obama who has a 41 per cent approval rating and UK Prime Minister David Cameron who is languishing on 38 per cent."}]}

But we have many young players trying to get into the squad, like Erik Durm (of Dortmund). \u2018We have to give these players an opportunity when the established ones are ruled out for whatever reason. \u2018So we definitely need this qualifying process to take the up and coming players by the hand \u2013 and allow them to be blooded for the highest level. \u2018Look at Toni Kroos, for example. We might need to leave him out if he\u2019s irreplaceable for Real Madrid. I have to accept that because sometimes World Cup tournaments can affect players\u2019 stamina and physical condition. \u2018It\u2019s difficult for them to have just three weeks\u2019 holiday and then go into pre-season training. They\u2019ve been thrown into the deep end again very quickly. Out of action: Sami Khedira (left) and Mats Hummels (right) are among Germany stars out of action this week . \u2018So it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll fall into a \u201cperformance hole\u201d and suffer a little crisis. That\u2019s when other players have to step up to the mark. \u2018For the established players, it\u2019s been very hard for them to get back to normal in the Bundesliga so I need potential candidates in my squad to fill their positions.\u2019 Low\u2019s immediate thoughts are with a rematch against the nation they defeated in Rio to lift their fourth world title. But, with the more meaningful game against Gordon Strachan\u2019s side lying around the corner, he admitted the Scots would not have been the team of choice to face in the first competitive game since the triumph in Brazil. \u2018Scotland is the kind of team Germany have always struggled against,\u2019 he added. \u2018With Scotland\u2019s sheer commitment and their running \u2013 they are a team who never give up no matter what the score is \u2013 then they are difficult opponents. Tight unit: Low and his now captain Bastian Schweinsteiger will lead the next wave of Germany players . \u2018Their fans get right behind them and drive them on. \u2018If you look at this group and the likes of Scotland and Ireland, they come across as similar teams. \u2018They have similar playing styles, who excel for their passion and the physicality of their football. \u2018We know this group is anything but easy because all the teams will try as hard as they can to make life difficult for us. \u2018The likes of Scotland have not been at the last few tournaments so they will give their all to be at the next European Championships.\u2019 While the focus must now be on the Euros, Low feels drawing a psychological line under what went on in South America may prove easier said than done. \u2018It\u2019s nothing that comes automatically and it\u2019s almost impossible to tell players to forget the World Cup,\u2019 he conceded. Last time out: Now-retired captain Philipp Lahm holds the World Cup trophy aloft in Rio de Janeiro . \u2018It\u2019s difficult for players to motivate themselves and be fully aware of the situation. \u2018It won\u2019t be easy but we want to win the game on Sunday. \u2018Despite the fact we have some players missing we still have enough quality to beat opponents such as Scotland. \u2018But, that said, it won\u2019t be easy over the next few months. \u2018We won\u2019t have players playing at the same level because some will have personal ups and downs, physical difficulties. \u2018Their bodies will demand a longer period of rest, so things will be different in the months ahead. \u2018The players will be robbed of physical strength because of the World Cup. Rio was really great but the message has to be \u2013 let\u2019s now focus on Paris 2016. That cycle begins with the match against Scotland on Sunday.\u2019 It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football\u2026 There's \u00a31,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager ."}]}

The militant, who has not been identified, reportedly said fighters blasted the Boeing 777 out of the sky - killing all 298 people on board - after mistaking it for a\u00a0Ukrainian government cargo plane. He said the rebels only realised their mistake when they began searching the crash site for the parachutes of military crew who may have bailed out the aircraft, only to find the bodies of children. Scroll down for videos . [caption] . The rebel - who worked locally as a miner before joining pro-Russian separatists - told a reporter for Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera that officers initially told him MH17 was a government plane. 'We shot down a Kiev plane, our superiors told us. We thought we were looking for baled-out Ukrainian pilots but instead we found dead civilians,' he was quoted as saying. 'All those poor people with baggage that certainly wasn\u2019t military... I was looking for a parachute and found the body of a little girl,' he added. His sensational admission that rebel forces shot down MH17 is in stark contrast to other pro-Russian forces in the area, who remain insistent that the plane was taken down by government troops. This morning Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, described evidence suggesting rebels had possession of a BUK missile launcher as 'fake'. A pro-Russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the site of the MH17 crash. 298 people were killed when the plane was apparently blasted out the sky by a surface to air missile . Gun wielding: Pro-Russian rebels, followed by international observers, walk by plane wreckage as they arrive for a media briefing at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 this week . The 31-year-old fighter, who said he . could not be named in the article but was happy to pose for photographs, . is understood to be from the Oplot combat unit, which was operating in . the area around the Hrabove crash site at the time MH17 was shot down. The newspaper claims they spoke to him at Torez railway station on Tuesday, where he posed for photographs standing alongside one of the refrigerated train carriages containing the bodies of 200 MH17 victims. Ten of his rebel colleagues are said to have stood guard while he spoke. Just hours later these bodies were transported to Khirkiv airport, from where 40 of them were yesterday flown back to Eindhoven in the Netherlands to begin the process of identification - something that is expected to take several months. The wife of a South African helicopter pilot killed in the MH17 disaster has been forced to cancel his credit cards because they have been used since the plane went down in Ukraine last week. Reine Dalziel's husband Cameron, a South African with a British passport who recently moved his family of four to Malaysia, was on board the Malaysia Airlines jet when it was struck by a missile fired by pro-Russian rebels. As it emerged that heartless rebels are using victims' credit cards, answering their phones at the crash site and stealing their belongings - including sentimental items such as jewellery - Ms Dalziel's brother Shane Hattingh told CNN his sister was stunned to see activity on her husband's account. South African helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel and his wife Reine recently moved to Malaysia with their two children . 'People are abusing it in the Ukraine... They have no respect for each other, look what they're doing,' Mr Hattingh told CNN. 'It's no surprise that they were treating the remains of people like that. It made me angry beyond words.' The claims comes as a series of disturbing new allegations emerged that added further weight to claims pro-Russian rebels looted the MH17 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster. Desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with 'eastern European-sounding voices'. After the initial shock, they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used, according to reports. Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Wreckage: A man looks at the debris scattered at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in a field near the village of Hrabove in the rebel-held Donetsk region of Ukraine . Tragic: A child's shoe is seen among the wreckage of MH17. A week after the disaster took place, the crash site is still littered with debris and, in some cases, body parts . Describing . the confusion in the minutes after the crash, the rebel was quoted as saying: 'Our commanders ordered us to get into the lorries . with our weapons and plenty of ammunition. Perhaps 10 minutes earlier, . there had been a huge explosion in the sky.' The men were allegedly told that white objects had been seen falling from the plane as it plummeted to the earth. These were wrongly assumed to have been parachutes and as such the men were told to prepare to fight to round up the military personal they mistakenly believed had been on the flight. 'All of a sudden, I saw scraps of material in a clearing,' he was quoted as saying. 'Underneath I found the body of a little girl, who can\u2019t have been more than five. She was lying face down. It was awful,' the militant added. 'That was when I realised it was a civilian plane. Not a military one. And all these dead people were civilians. A heap of burst suitcases confirmed it,' he went on to say. Care: Coffins containing the remains of MH17 are removed from a transport plane at Eindhoven airport. The dignified reception was in stark contrast to the treatment of the victims' remains in eastern Ukraine . Remembrance: Stewardesses at Schiphol airport observe one-minute of silence in remembrance of the victims of flight MH17 . Yesterday Queen Maxima of the Netherlands broke down in tears alongside members of the Dutch royal family as the first bodies of those killed in the MH17 crash arrived back in Holland during a poignant and emotional ceremony attended by relatives of the victims. The remains of around 40 international victims of the Malaysia Airlines tragedy left Ukraine's Kharkiv airport on two military planes, ahead of a painstaking identification process. The dignified reception at Eindhoven airport is in stark contrast to the treatment of the victims' remains in eastern Ukraine in the days after the crash, where pro-Russian rebels left corpses to decay in the summer heat in body bags dumped around the crash site. Among those attending the solemn ceremony were King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, who held on to each other's hands as the bodies were removed from the transporter aircraft. At several points the Dutch Queen was seen wiping tears from her face.

Respect: King Willem-Alexander (second left) Queen Maxima (third left) and Prime Minister Mark Rutte (third right) observe a minute of silence during a ceremony to mark the return of the first bodies of passengers and crew killed in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 . British father Barry Sweeney, 52, . travelled through the night to meet the planes in the hope that the body . of his son Liam, 28, might be on board. He . said: \u2018We need closure. We need to see our children. All the families, . the mums, the dads, brothers, sisters, we need them back here.\u2019 He and his other son Marc, 25, comforted each other during the sombre ceremony yesterday. Dutch military personal then carried . each coffin on their shoulders to a motorcade of hearses. They were . driven to military barracks in Hilversum, where the process of . identifying them began. Last night, it was unclear whether any of the bodies that arrived in the Netherlands were those of British citizens. Undignified: Dozens of bodies of MH17 victims were seen being loaded on to a rubbish truck so they could be removed from the crash site and taken to a train station in Torez . Discarded: Body bags containing the remains of MH17 passengers were seen dumped around the crash site for several days after the crash. Many of the bodies were decomposing in the summer heat . Mr . Sweeney, from Killingworth, North Tyneside, managed to catch a flight . from Newcastle to Amsterdam early yesterday morning after renewing his . passport on a fast-track. Mr .

Costs be damned. Well, not really. But those who moan and groan about the \"costs\" of the Olympic movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city. Tokyo is a great, safe and hopefully cost effective choice to host the 2020 Summer Games. The Japanese capital achieved a crushing victory over rivals Istanbul and Madrid in Saturday's final International Olympic Committee (IOC) vote. As the Financial Times notes, the current budget projections are 0.2% of 2012 GDP. Plus, more than half of the $8 billion build-out cost projections is already set aside, the new hosts tell us. Construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts. Architects have already been hard at work. Full-time and part-time jobs will be created. Sure, the budget will rise. It always does. London tripled its initial budget estimates to $14 billion for the construction, security etc. and privately raised $3 billion or so to stage the games, from corporate sponsors, ticket sales and broadcasting rights. Construction money came from taxpayers and lottery funding. In fact, once London confirmed its final budget about five years before the Games, it stuck to it. It can be done. Now, Winter Olympics are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs. Many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places. Let's hope Sochi's $10bn budget (or more) is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year-round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a Formula One grand prix. And yes, you can always point to the abysmal state Montreal was left it with its stadium after 1976. It took something like 30 years to pay off. Montreal is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow. It has rightfully scared the IOC and host cities into getting it right, or face financial headaches for years to come. Athens 2004 was also a prescription for how not to do it. Expensive white elephants still sit idle. The last minute \"Mediterranean\" rush to finish off some venues and infrastructure plans inevitably lead to higher costs. Atlanta '96 was no great success either, but for the start of the trend to plan the use of big venues, before the Games began. The Olympic Stadium was partially knocked down and used by the city's popular baseball team. Beijing and London went in other ways -- new stadia for the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics -- with a vow to keep the spirit of the Olympics in the building's bones. While Beijing's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction, London's will be home to a mix of football, athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes, lots of tourists. Speaking of tourists, those who stayed from London in droves last summer, were here this summer, I can tell you. I have not suffered from London being so busy as July and August just gone. London also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city. Sure, the poor in the area should have had that already, but now they do; along with new schools, swimming pools and housing. Could Olympic money be \"spent\" in better ways? Not likely. Governments often go over budget and over time when undertaking large infrastructure projects. The Olympics give cities one big, wonderful immoveable objective; a deadline. As Rio is now learning, there is no pressure like the pressure of IOC inspectors."}]}

A woman who 'borrowed' a young girl as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager kept the child chained to a post for eight hours a day over two years, it was revealed today. The shocking case of child abuse resulted in police taking the four-year-old girl's 'carer' into custody - but have now decided not to charge her out of pity for her own poverty-stricken circumstances. Police and child protection workers who went to a village hut near the Cambodian town of Kemarak Pumin found the girl sitting on the floor of the community building with a chain padlocked around her ankle, securing her to a post. Heartbreaking: A girl was tied to a post eight hours a day by a woman who 'borrowed' her as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager . The Phnom Penh Post reported today that the girl had told police that on one occasion she was so thirsty that she had to drink her own urine. Last night the girl was in the care of social workers as the shocking circumstances of her imprisonment were revealed. Police said the 'adoptive mother', who had loaned money to the child's biological mother - had taken the four-year-old as collateral against a loan, but found it impossible to care for the girl during the day because she had to go to work. 'The adoptive mother said the girl used to get in rainwater and get messy and she feared she might leave the house and drown or get lost,' said Srey Touch, head of the local police human rights and juvenile protection unit. Released: The girl was found by police and child protection workers and placed in the care of social workers . The adoptive worked as a farmer at a plantation about half a mile from the hut and chained the child each workday from 7am to 11am and then from 1pm to 5pm, the paper reported. Police were alerted to the girl's plight by Keo Chhon, a 60-year-old village resident who told the Post: 'I felt so much pity for her. It is so bad. 'I think all children have the right to be cared for, not chained up like a dog. I wonder why the other workers didn't report it, but for me, I had to report it.' Despite the treatment the girl had suffered, her biological mother said she could still not take her back because of her poverty. 'I love her but I have no-one to look after her when I go to work,' she said, repeating what the adoptive mother had told police. Child abuse is common among poverty-stricken village families in Cambodia, particularly as adults are unaware of laws that protect youngsters. Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children's rights section of the child protection group Adhoc, said that youngsters are more often the subject of beatings and other abuse, . 'In Cambodia, 75 to 80 per cent are uneducated and they don't know how to care for their kids,' she said. 'Rarely is there a case where the nighbour or relative makes a complaint.'"}]}

Sarah Palin, is completely unqualified to be president. (CNN) -- John McCain needs what Kinky Friedman calls \"a checkup from the neck up.\" In choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate, he is not thinking \"outside the box,\" as some have said. More like out of his mind. Palin a first-term governor of a state with more reindeer than people, will have to put on a few pounds just to be a lightweight. Her personal story is impressive: former fisherman, mother of five. But that hardly qualifies her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. For a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible. Suddenly, McCain's age and health become central issues in the campaign, as does his judgment. In choosing this featherweight, McCain passed over Tom Ridge, a decorated combat hero, a Cabinet secretary and the former two-term governor of the large, complex state of Pennsylvania. iReport.com: 'McCain pick might be a gimmick' He passed over Mitt Romney, who ran a big state, Massachusetts; a big company, Bain Capital; and a big event, the Olympics. He passed over Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who is knowledgeable about the military, good on television and -- obviously -- a woman. He passed over Joe Lieberman, his best friend in the Senate and fellow Iraq Kool-Aid drinker. He passed over former congressman, trade negotiator and budget director Rob Portman. And he also passed over Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas. For months, the McCainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience. In his first presidential decision, John McCain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country, potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful, complicated, difficult job in human history.

A hospital could keep you warm and provide food and nursing care, but as surgeon and writer Atul Gawande pointed out, in many cases the patient would do no better than if he or she had stayed home. In those days, doctors who mastered the few techniques that could make a difference, such as setting fractures and treating certain kinds of heart conditions, were seemingly all-powerful, Gawande told the TED2012 conference in March. \"A doctor could kind of know it all and do it all,\" he said in an interview with CNN following his talk. Doctors were rewarded for being cowboys, for being daring and self sufficient. Today, the world of medicine promises and provides much more -- cures and care for many of the worst health problems people have. But doctors can no longer know everything and do everything. As medical knowledge has exploded, doctors increasingly must specialize in a field to absorb all the relevant information to treat a certain kind of illness. And a patient who goes to a hospital often winds up being treated and cared for by as many as 15 doctors, nurses and therapists, Gawande said. The result? \"Well, it's been a disaster,\" he said. \"We have 40 percent of coronary artery disease patients who receive incomplete or inappropriate care, we have 2 million people pick up infections in hospitals because one of those people on that team failed to follow basic hygiene practices.\" Watch Atul Gawande's TED Talk . \"Holding on to our streak of autonomy, each of us, we end up losing the patient in between,\" he said. Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, also is a researcher at Harvard University and a writer at The New Yorker. Today doctors are still often rewarded and trained as cowboys, but Gawande says what we really need are doctors who can function as members of a team, the way those in an auto racing pit crew work together to get vehicles back in the race. Ted.com: Trial, error and the God complex . Gawande has been a pioneer in advocating the use of checklists by medical teams working together in surgery or on other procedures. \"We've had checklists in medicine for people we considered the lowest on the totem pole, but the idea that the surgeon would have to follow a checklist is anathema,\" Gawande said. But in fact, he added, \"when checklists have been used to make sure even the best, most specialized doctors don't miss key steps in providing care ... we're finding that carefully designed checklists cut death rates in half in surgeries, that they can eliminate certain kinds of infections and that they can slash costs.\" Gawande has found reason to question the assumption that the most expensive care must be the best care. \"What we're discovering is that the best care, the places getting the best results, are often among the least expensive,\" he said. In those places, doctors and nurses providing care function like teams. \"We are going through a dramatic change where it's no longer about what your doctor knows, it's about what a team of doctors, nurses and others are able to do together.\" TED.com: Doctors make mistakes -- can we talk about that? These days Gawande brings a checklist with him into the operating room. At first, it was a bit of a shock for him. \"I did it reluctantly. I have been someone who believes, you know, do I need a checklist? No ... but i didn't want to be a hypocrite. I was bringing them to Tanzania and Seattle, so I started using a checklist myself. So that meant before the patient went to sleep we would do a series of checks -- not just, 'Do we have the right person and the right side of the body?' But also, 'Do we have a plan for what happens if this is a high-blood-loss case?' \"Before the incision, we'd introduce ourselves by name because it would turn out often that you would have a team of people working together for the first time who may not know each other very well. \"We discuss the plan in detail, and in doing these things I found from the very beginning that we were catching problems that we were missing otherwise. The anesthesiologist or the nurse was noticing things that I had missed. \"I have not gotten through a week of surgery in three years using this kind of checklist without it catching something that was a danger for the patient or would have made the care better.\""}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- When Bridget and Scott Bear were expecting their first child, they wanted to know what it would cost so they could set aside enough money in their health savings account. Knowing in advance what the price tag would be for the birth of their son gave the Bears \"peace of mind.\" The Omaha, Nebraska, couple went to Alegent Health's Web site and found the My Cost function, entered their insurance information and learned the hospital charges would be around $2,500, Bridget Bear said. When Bridget Bear gave birth to their son, Lawson, on April 2 at Lakeside Hospital -- a healthy 8-pound, 8-ounce baby -- the couple were ready for the bill, she said. Alegent is one of a growing number of hospitals, Web sites, even states, helping patients comparison shop on the Internet before undergoing a medical procedure or test. Hospitals say they're responding to a growing demand from patients who are paying for more of their health care out of pocket, thanks to rising deductibles and the advent of high deductible, consumer-driven plans like the Bears have. In the early 2000s, Bellin Health System in Green Bay, Wisconsin, began receiving more calls from patients wanting to know what a particular procedure would cost, said Jeff Hampton, director of revenue cycle management. \"As sad as it sounds, we had to say we didn't know,\" Hampton said. That's because something like knee replacement isn't one expense but many. There are the surgeon's fee, the operating room charge, equipment and supplies, the hospital bed during recovery, and other costs. Five years ago, Bellin put the information together so would-be patients could get an accurate picture of the final bill. On its Compare Care Line, a Bellin financial adviser provides an average cost from the previous six months for a given procedure and the price range over that time period. \"People are shopping around more,\" Hampton said. \"If consumers want to know what the cost of something is going to be, we should be able to give them an answer.\" Alegent, with nine hospitals in Nebraska and southwest Iowa, started My Cost in January 2007, posting the price of more than 500 tests and procedures along with data on quality of care. Integris Health, a 14-hospital system in Oklahoma City, has a Consumer Price Line number that allows patients to learn what the out-of-pocket costs will be for their procedures. The service started in July 2007 after CEO Stanley Hupfeld had some \"secret shoppers\" try to get pricing information, said Nicole White, Integris spokesperson. Consumer Price Line receives between 800 and 1,000 calls a month, she said. Sixteen state hospital associations operate Web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies, maternity stays and knee or hip replacements: Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. Other states have their own systems. Minnesota health care providers collaborated on the HealthScores Web site, which allows price comparisons between 110 providers for 103 common medical procedures. The Web site tells what insurance companies pay, on average, for procedures ranging from Caesarean delivery to a colonoscopy. Pennsylvania has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its Health Care Cost Containment Council Web site, but the data are several years old. Still, it underscores the enormous differences in prices. For example, knee replacement costs ranged from $11,243 to $97,031 at the state's hospitals. Even individual hopsitals are striving to offer more transparency. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, posts very detailed information about prices on the hospital's Web site. Spokesperson Jason Aldous said it's part of the medical center's mission to provide transparency about cost, outcomes and patient satisfaction. The information is only a starting point, though, Aldous said. \"We want that to drive you to a more informed conversation\" with a doctor, he said. \"A bilateral knee replacement is not like buying a car on the lot.\" But Brad Myers, co-founder of New Choice Health, said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think. The eight-month-old site was created to do for health care what automobile pricing guides did for new car buying 20 years ago, Myers said. New Choice Health, which does not charge for its service, lists the average cost insurance companies pay for 400 different procedures at different facilities across the country. Want to know the cost of a colonoscopy in Cleveland? New Choice Health gives you more than 50 facilities, with prices ranging from $550 to $1,200. How about a PET scan in Portland? The site offers more than 20 facilities with a price range of $1,600 to $2,100. The site is designed for people who are uninsured, individually insured or with a high deductible plan, Myers said. Patients who are not covered in a group plan generally get bills three times as high, he said. He advocates bargaining. \"Just picking up the phone will get you 20 percent off. Nine times out of 10, if you want to haggle, it's more like 50 percent off,\" Myers says. New Choice Health, which went live in January, now gets 40,000 to 50,000 users a month, Myers says. Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said cost sites such as New Choice Health are crude tools because they don't tell people with traditional plans what they'll pay out of pocket. A lot depends on how much of their deductible they've already spent. Also, people with expensive chronic diseases such as diabetes usually reach their deductible early in the year and are less concerned about price after that, Fronstin said. Childbirth is a perfect procedure to price ahead of time, according to Kathleen Stoll at Families USA. Others are not as clear cut. With knee surgery, for example, patients may not know the exact procedure they need or what complications could arise, she said. Bridget Bear said knowing what hospital fees would be in advance gave her and her husband peace of mind: \"We were able to enjoy the anticipation of Lawson a little bit more instead of having to worry about the financial piece of it.\" CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report."}]}

A pair of identical twin brothers who were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can\u2019t tell them apart. Ryan and Grant Seymour, 19, were caught on CCTV - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year. A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Identical twin brothers Ryan and Grant Seymour were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl and have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can't tell them apart . A court heard the twins also hurled vases and bottles at their victims\u00a0 - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers are almost impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' as both were naked from the waist up and wearing blue shorts. They have both sentenced to nine months' detention at a young offenders institute after officers could not work out which one had been involved in more of the violence. Jailing the pair at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn said: 'Your conduct has been described by witnesses as mayhem, barbaric and vile. 'You were not the only people to behave disgracefully. 'There was undoubted provocation. 'A group of other men visited the house to cause trouble. Pictured is Ryan Seymour.  He and his twin were caught on CCTV  - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year . A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Pictured is Grant Seymour . 'That was the catalyst for what followed. 'The trouble started in the house and spilled out onto the street. We can see from the CCTV how close this was to the centre of Biddulph.' The court heard the vicious attack was sparked when members of the Yoxall family banged on the door of the twins\u2019 friend Daniel Tatters\u2019s home. Prosecuting Oliver Woolhouse, said: 'A witness living in South View described hearing a disturbance in the street. 'He could see from his living room window four men go into a house. 'A short time later a man was heard hammering on the door, it was opened and he went inside, followed by six others. 'A Peugeot 306 car and a van appeared and the occupants of the car got out and stood by the front door. 'A man then appeared, he was bleeding heavily from his head and was followed by the rest of the men. 'They were shouting at each other and there was something of a stand-off. The twins also hurled missiles at their victims\u00a0 - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers (left Ryan and right Grant) are impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' Probably the most famous twins in criminal history were Ronnie and Reggie Kray from Bethnal Green in east London. It was reported that early on in their careers, both twins were arrested for a particularly vicious assault but the police did not prosecute because they could not identify which twin was the assailant. Since identical twins - also known as monozygotic twins - come from the same fertilised egg, it was believed that they have the same DNA. However, a new test is being developed which would enable twins' DNA to be told apart by scientists in Germany. They have found a subtle genetic difference which means there is now a definitive test to learn which twin was at the scene of a crime. This breakthrough will stop the current procedure whereby one twin might escape justice because of the inability of the authorities to tell them apart. 'The witness says one of the twins had a small portable TV that was thrown through the car window. 'Glass bottles and vases were also thrown at the vehicle before the driver of the car attempted to drive away. 'One of the twins then attacked the vehicle with a large metal spanner. His arm was bleeding.' The pair both admitted one count of affray and Ryan was also caged for a further 15 months to run consecutively for an unrelated affray for an earlier incident. Jason Holt, defending Ryan, said: 'It is accepted that the other family came to the house of Daniel Tatters and that\u2019s what caused this incident in the first place. 'They even blocked both ends of the road with a car and a van. 'Mr Seymour has matured since this incident, he is no longer the angry man he once was. 'He even apologises to the people of South View who saw this going on.' Robert Smith, defending Grant, added: 'Since this offence in July last year there has not been any further incident involving Grant. 'He is now a roofer and has stuck at it. He has reduced his drinking and now has a stable life. He has been out of trouble.' Co-accused, Daniel Tatters, 29, and Peter Holland, 36, both from Biddulph, were each handed a 12-month community order, with supervision for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work."}]}

Yet, even at the age of 74, Melvyn Bragg shows no sign of easing up \u2013 because his extraordinary workload is the key to his health. In a deeply personal interview with Radio Times, he revealed that his workaholism was his salvation, protecting him from the mental breakdowns he suffered as a teenager and after the suicide of his first wife in 1971. Lady and Lord Bragg: Cate Haste (Lady . Bragg) and Lord Bragg are both celebrated authors . Lord Bragg said: \u2018Work. Always.

He admitted he had concerns about the Coalition\u2019s support for the arts but added: \u2018Looking back on the last 25 to 30 years, it\u2019s par for the course. It\u2019s very odd that philistine governments can do terrific things. \u2018For instance, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government put Channel 4 in place.

A Fijian soldier who moved to the UK after serving in the British Army for nine years faces deportation on Sunday because of a simple administrative blunder. Private Filimone Lacanivalu, who served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and Afghanistan, left\u00a0 the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment in 2010. Mistakenly believing Commonwealth troops automatically\u00a0 qualified to remain in Britain after more than four years in the military, he failed to apply to the Home Office for residency within 28 days of leaving the Army and missed the paperwork\u2019s deadline. Years of service: Filimon Lacanialu, left, is pictured on patrol in the Falkland Islands . Now Pte Lacanivalu, 34, has spent a month detained by the UK Border Agency in an immigration removal centre at Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, awaiting deportation on Sunday. Others held at the centre include murderers, rapists and drug dealers. Last night he said he felt \u2018betrayed\u2019 by Britain. He said: \u2018It is confusing, sad and depressing. \u2018I never dreamt that this is the place that I would end up... I have been let down. I have been betrayed.\u2019 In a plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, he said: \u2018Please take account of my military service and what I have done for Great Britain. Release me from here and I will continue my life as usual.\u2019 Pte Lacanivalu\u2019s case has left the Government accused once again of \u2018abandoning\u2019 the military, following round after round of spending cuts. It comes after the furore over Fiji-born Lance Corporal Bale Baleiwai, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who was threatened with deportation because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010. Following an outcry, he was granted an 11th hour reprieve. Campaigners for Pte Lacanivalu will contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay in Britain despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car. His case also appears at odds with Mr Cameron\u2019s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society\u2019s duty of care to servicemen. Pleae: Pte Lacanivalu has begged the Prime Minister to intervene and let him stay in the country because of his military service . Pte Lacanivale, whose uncles served in the Army, including one who fought with the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, signed up with 2 YORKS in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at Buckingham Palace. He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in Afghanistan. He said: \u2018That was the first time for me to see people getting wounded and killed.\u2019 He left the Forces in January 2010 but several months later received documents from the Army informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days. The soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the Army. He hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in Britain but he was informed in September he had been rejected. On October 12 he went to a Home Office centre in Croydon, South London, hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings. Now Vinita Templeton, a solicitor with law firm Duncan Lewis, is planning to launch a judicial review action against his detention, which would include an application to block Pte Lacanivalu\u2019s imminent deportation. Ian Sadler, the father of Trooper Jack Sadler, killed in Afghanistan while Pte Lacanivalu was on the frontline, said he was \u2018dismayed\u2019 by the situation. He said: \u2018He should be put up in a hotel and a civil servant should straighten this out.\u2019 A Home Office spokesman said: \u2018Mr Lacanivalu applied to stay in the UK outside of the period. However, due to his service with the Army his case is now under review.\u2019"}]}

The BBC has admitted faking key scenes in a hit nature documentary about grizzly bears. Programme makers were forced to apologise after it emerged hit BBC1 show Great Bear Stakeout deliberately misled viewers by carefully editing footage. A dramatic episode appeared to show one of the documentary's expert guides watching and commentating as a mother bear took her cubs into the ocean, before one of them drowned. In fact, the guide \u2013 Chris Morgan \u2013 was never present at the touching scene. Filmed separately, the shots of him standing by the seaside were later edited together with the original footage to make it seem he was just yards from the dangerous animals. The truth was only revealed yesterday \u2013 more than seven months after it was aired on TV \u2013 after an investigation by the BBC\u2019s governing body found the public were \u2018misled\u2019 and trust in the BBC could be damaged. Up close, but not too close: A bear inspects a remote camera in the documentary Great Bear Stakeout. But the show has been criticised for being less than honest . It is the latest in a series of fakery rows to engulf the BBC\u2019s respected natural history unit, and comes just two years after it was revealed Sir David Attenborough\u2019s Frozen Planet series had shown supposedly wild footage of a polar bear and her cubs \u2013 which was actually filmed in a zoo. Last night Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said it was \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019 to fake footage, adding: \u2018It is wrong to mislead viewers, and as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has happened. \u2018Otherwise, the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes and viewers\u2019 confidence in the BBC\u2019s output will be undermined. \u2018I welcome the fact the BBC Trust have recognised that this was misleading and wrong.\u2019 In its damning report yesterday, the corporation\u2019s governing body admitted the latest scandal could further damage the public\u2019s faith in its output. It said: \u2018Viewers were on a journey with the guide and this was a crucial event which was interpreted through the eyes of the guide. On location? The Great Bear Stakeout team, including Chris Morgan (centre), pose up for the camera at Katmal National Park, Alaska . \u2018The Trustees agreed that it was not acceptable to portray him as if he was present when he was not present. The public had been misled.\u2019 Saying the BBC\u2019s natural history programming is \u2018one of the jewels in the crown of British broadcasting\u2019, the BBC Trust report continued: \u2018Enactments of this nature could undermine the trust of the public in the BBC\u2019s natural history programmes and even risked casting doubt on the accuracy of the natural history depicted in the BBC\u2019s programmes. \u2018This would be an extremely unfortunate outcome which could damage a world class brand.\u2019 Filmed in Alaska, Great Bear Stakeout drew plaudits when it was screened in April and captivated almost four million viewers. The fake scene \u2013 contained in the first of four episodes \u2013 showed a mother bear, Parsnip, taking her two cubs Pushki and Wren into the ocean. Wren was washed away by the waves and presumed drowned. 'It is wrong to mislead viewers and, . as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things . are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has . happened. Otherwise . the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes . and viewers\u2019 confidence in the BBC\u2019s output will be undermined' - MP John Whittingdale . The BBC Trust said producers gave repeated reassurances the shot was accurate. They did not reveal the true sequence of events because they felt it was \u2018acceptable\u2019 and \u2018did not alter the editorial truth of the scene\u2019. The report added: \u2018It was only when a planned radio interview proposed to feature the cub-drowning sequence that the bear guide flagged up the fact that he had not actually been present at the time.\u2019 In the wake of the revelations, the BBC required all natural history staff to carry out new training into editorial standards. The show\u2019s executive producer Gavin Henderson said: \u2018Please accept my apologies for this mistake. The Natural History Unit is taking immediate steps to address the issues raised and to prevent similar issues occurring by providing additional training across the entire unit.\u2019 Following the Frozen Planet scandal in 2011, Sir David Attenborough \u2013 who narrated the series \u2013 defended the footage by saying he was \u2018making movies\u2019. Last year, an episode of Planet Earth Live \u2013 starring Richard Hammond and Julia Bradbury \u2013 was slammed by viewers after it emerged most of the first episode was in fact pre-recorded."}]}

Spared jail: Would-be teacher Abi Ellis appearing at Truro Crown Court after attacking another girl on a night out by biting her face . A pretty undergraduate and wannabe teacher who has twice BITTEN women in the face during boozed up brawls has been spared jail. Violent Abi Ellis, 20, sank her teeth into startled Katie Roberts during her most recent attack - after the two women clashed outside a nightclub. Ellis is prone to losing her temper and when she does she likes to lash out and 'bite', a court was told. The latest 'violent and extremely antisocial' assault left Miss Roberts with a gaping wound to her cheek which later became infected. Both girls had gone to Falmouth School but the former pupils were not friends, Truro Crown Court in Cornwall heard. The pair were attending separate birthday parties when Ellis spilt a drink on Miss Roberts and they exchanged words. Trouble flared again outside Truro\u2019s L2 nightspot when Katie went to get in a pre-booked taxi with her brother - only to find Ellis in the vehicle. But when Katie asked Ellis what she was doing, the brunette attacked her and bit into her left cheek. She was found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, ordered to carry out a community order for 12 months, undertake 180 hours unpaid work and pay her victim \u00a3500. The court heard Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl. Thomas Bradnock, prosecuting, said: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn\u2019t it? You bite. 'It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.' Katie told the court: 'I was obviously very shocked that she was in my brother\u2019s taxi and I said, \u2018what is she doing?\u2019 'She launched at me and by that time her teeth were in my cheek and gripped on very tightly. I touched my cheek and there was blood on my hand. I was very emotional.' Scene: The disagreement occurred outside Truro's L2 nightclub, which resulted in Ms Ellis biting a fellow reveller's cheek . The wound later became infected and Katie, reported the attack shortly after it happened on December 18, 2011. Ellis spent Christmas in Ireland before travelling to Thailand, where she spent nine months teaching English, but was arrested upon her return. Mr Bradnock said Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl. He told her: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn\u2019t it? You bite. It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.' Ellis, a Tesco receptionist about to start an English literature and language degree at Brighton University in just a few weeks, claimed the bite was in self defence. Recorder James Waddington told Ellis, of Falmouth, Cornwall, she had come close to going to jail. He said: 'The matter has taken a long time because you made yourself scarce after this incident. You decided to go out of the area, no doubt hoping that matters would calm down. 'Be in no doubt that this was a serious assault and it is futile trying to offload responsibility on to your unfortunate victim. It was wholly unacceptable, violent and extremely antisocial.'"}]}

A bitter husband posted pictures of his estranged wife on an adult website with a message declaring she would 'do anything for \u00a340'. Michael Anderson, 49, posted holiday snaps of his wife Michelle - with whom he has two children - in a bikini on a website called Hot Mums and MILFs. Anderson, who pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment without violence yesterday, added a comment which said his estranged wife of 22 years could 'go to the highest bidder', a court heard. Harassment: Michael Anderson, seen left outside court\u00a0 yesterday, posted holiday pictures of his estranged wife Michelle, right, in a bikini on an adult website . Anderson posted a link to the adult webpage on Facebook after adding the holiday photographs. 'Devastated' Mrs Anderson, 42, called the police when friends called her to tell her what he had done, and her estranged husband was arrested. Anderson was given a three-month community order at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday, and made the subject of an indefinite restraining order banning him from making contact with his ex. Mrs Anderson said in an interview after the hearing that the former couple, who have two sons, split in October when she learned he had cheated on her with one of her close friends. But Anderson embarked on a campaign of harassment after she left him, Mrs Anderson said. 'He did not take the news well, bombarding me with texts and phone calls and even threatening to kill himself,' she said. 'In January he put the pictures on the Hot Mums and MILFs website and then posted a link to the page on Facebook. 'My friends started texting me and calling me to let me know what he had done. 'I wasn't friends with Michael on Facebook anymore, but my mates sent me the link. 'I was devastated when I saw the pictures and what he had written, it was horrific. 'I was so embarrassed,' said Mrs Anderson, who added that her ex had written that she would 'do anything for \u00a340'. 'There were photos taken of me on holiday and I was wearing a bikini.' Mrs Anderson said the pictures were taken down after she called the police. 'They were online for about three hours altogether, but it was long enough,' said the mother-of-two, who said she wants to 'put him behind me and concentrate on my two children'. At yesterday's court hearing Paul Doney, prosecuting, told the court that the harassment all took place between the beginning of January and early February this year. 'The victim said he had been very controlling,' he said. 'Unpleasant': Anderson is seen with estranged wife Michelle in a photograph taken on a family holiday . 'On January 4 she was in the Chichester Arms in South Shields with one of their sons, who was playing in a poker tournament. 'At one point he went up to their son and said he was going to knock her head off. 'Later that day he turned up at her house and started shouting before trying to open the kitchen window.' Anderson was warned by the police to keep away from his former wife, but later in January he turned up at the house demanding a computer from her that he claimed was his. Mr Doney added: 'She then found out that he had posted holiday photographs of her in a bikini on this site, saying she would do anything for \u00a340 and could go to the highest bidder.' A statement from Mrs Anderson read out in court said he had been making her life 'hell'. It said: 'I was scared of physical and emotional violence and feel like I am being stalked. 'He is making my life hell and he knows it.' Charlton James Carr, defending, said: 'It all happened in the aftermath of Christmas, a particularly emotional time for families. 'But since this happened there have been no more problems and everyone has got back on with their lives.' Magistrates read a report about Anderson from the probation service before sentencing him. Chairman of the bench Gordon Minto said: 'You appear to have a complete lack of acknowledgement that there was anything untoward about your behaviour. 'We don't see any evidence that you understand what you did was wrong - which makes this particularly unpleasant. 'The only saving grace is that this seems to have stopped.' Anderson was given a three-month community order with an electronically-tagged curfew between 7pm and 7am and made the subject of a restraining order. He was also ordered to pay \u00a385 costs and a \u00a360 victim surcharge."}]}

It was July 27, Liverpool had just breezed past Olympiakos in a pre-season friendly. After Gerrard had dealt with the thorny issue of what happened during the title run-in last April, then discussed what would happen in the post Luis Suarez era, the conversation turned to Frank Lampard. His old England colleague had just decided to embark on a fresh challenge in the MLS and it was put to Gerrard whether he could ever envisage a life beyond Liverpool. This was his response. Gerrard has only ever played for Liverpool, winning the Champions League in Istanbul in 2005 . Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . Gerrard was instrumental in his sides run to the Champions League final in 2005 to win their fifth European title . \u2018At his age of 36, he\u2019s had a wonderful career and I don\u2019t think he has anything to prove in England anymore,\u2019 said Gerrard. \u2018He\u2019s broken records with Chelsea and won everything with them. I think it\u2019s a perfect move for him at his time. One day that might happen to me, I don\u2019t know. \u2018I\u2019ve never really discussed it with anyone or thought about it. Maybe one day I would like the chance to go away from Liverpool for a short time and try something different. But I haven\u2019t given it much thought. That carrot hasn\u2019t been dangled yet.\u2019 Now it has and it has prompted Gerrard to make a heart-rending decision. From May 23, Liverpool Football Club will no longer have their talismanic No 8 to turn to. There was always going to be a day when Liverpool and Gerrard were no more but, even still, the news takes some getting used to. Like Jamie Carragher (left) Gerrard's departure will leave a void that is impossible to fill . Liverpool now have a job to do replacing two club legends who will leave within two years of each other . Gerrard has been offered a new deal by his club, but will not sign a deal beyond the end of the season . Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy . Gerrard fast established himself as a fans favourite and has stayed with Liverpool for 17 years . There has been a lot of noise this season about Gerrard, his form and whether he can still contribute in the Barclays Premier League. He might not be the rampaging force of nature who, 10 years ago, inspired that night in Istanbul but his role runs deeper than what happens on the pitch. Gerrard, along with Jamie Carragher, provided the heart and soul to Liverpool during countless changes since the turn of the Millennium and has always been on hand to say or do the right thing at the right time. They had been the link between the terrace and the squad. Carragher has never been adequately replaced in the 18 months since his retirement but if manager Brendan Rodgers had a hard job looking for a new No 23, he is now faced with an impossible challenge to find someone who will adequately fill that No 8 jersey. Gerrard has never won the Premier League title, coming closest last season when Liverpool fell just short . Since making his Liverpool debut in 1998 Gerrard has played almost 500 league games for the club . This decision is something Gerrard has been wrestling with for months, the excitement of pursuing a new challenge somewhere else always being counterbalanced by the love and affinity he has for Liverpool, the club he grew up dreaming he would one day represent. He will not want the next five months to become overly nostalgic and he will be committed to helping Liverpool obtain their highest possible finish in the Premier League, while hoping that, perhaps, there will be one final day at Wembley. Once the end of May arrives, though, that will be it. And Liverpool will never be the same again."}]}

And with a price tag of \u00a33.6million Euan and Suzanne Blair's new marital home in central London is more than a new couple could ever dream of. But the new Mrs Blair is not the Mrs Blair listed on the property deeds. Land Registry documents have revealed the six-bedroom Georgian town house in Marylebone is joint owned by Euan and his mother Cherie Blair. The new Mr and Mrs Blair (left) have moved into their new \u00a33.6million Georgian townhouse (right). But the new bride is not the Mrs Blair listed on the house deeds after Euan purchased the home with his mother Cherie Blair . Cherie was also the joint owner of her eldest son's former home, which was sold for \u00a3860,000 profit. It implies the barrister retains a control over her son's finances, as she does for her other children Kathryn and Nicky, with whom she also jointly owns properties. David Kirwan, of Kirwans Solicitors, told The Telegraph Suzanne Blair - the daughter of Jonathan Ashman, a motor racing entrepreneur, and the stepdaughter of TV weather presenter Sian Lloyd - would find it harder to claim a share of the value of the house, were her marriage to end in divorce. He said:\u00a0 'She would face an uphill . task if the marriage ended, particularly if they hadn't been married for . long,' he said. 'As a wife . she would have some claim on the property, but it would be a much more . litigious matter than if she was registered as joint owner, when there . would be a presumption of a 50/50 split. Cherie and Tony Blair, pictured at Euan and Suzanne's wedding in September . 'It looks very much like a case of Tony and Cherie Blair managing their empire of assets.' The couple dated for eight years before marrying in The South Pavilion, the \u00a35.75 million Grade I-listed mansion in Buckinghamshire, owned by Tony and Cherie Blair. Just days before they tied the knot, the 30-year-old, who is thought to be preparing a bid to become an MP, and his mother completed on the sale of the new property in Marylebone. The impressive house boasts a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bathrooms and two reception rooms and is close to Regents Park. The couple moved after selling their previous home, also in Marylebone. The four-storey property bought for \u00a31.29million in 2010 was put on the market for \u00a32.35million. Three years later the house has been sold for \u00a32.15million, netting the Blairs \u00a3860,000 in profit. Euan and his mother paid \u00a33,625,000 for the six-bedroom new house, a short walk from their previous home. Cherie has interests in eight properties, with a total value of around \u00a324million. Euan recently moved from his job at investment bank Morgan Stanley, taking up a new post at Sarina Russo Job Access, a Coventry-based recruitment agency. It was seen as an indication that Tony Blair's eldest son was preparing to run for MP. However Labour has already selected its candidate for the Coventry North East seat, rumoured to be the 30-year-old's preferred target, leaving him with a six-year wait for the 2020 General Election, his first chance of becoming an MP for the constituency."}]}

You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. \"The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,\" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called \"white hat\" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001. One year after the survey was conducted, CNN Business Traveler met Remnant at London's Heathrow airport, which was not included in the original survey, to test the potential dangers to unprotected Wi-Fi users.  Watch what happened when we took a hacker to Heathrow \u00bb . Armed with a laptop, our \"white hat\" hacker took a seat in the crowded departure lounge at Terminal 3 and proceeded to scan the airwaves with his laptop, using a program he downloaded form the Internet called Airodump. \"It dumps everything in the air,\" Remnant explained. \"So if I execute the command to start Airodump, instantly I'm seeing probably 20 wireless networks with four or five of those having relatively weak server security.\" \"There are several risks just on this screen,\" he continued. \"One is that we actually don't know whether the public networks are legitimate or not.\" The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was \"Free Public Wi-Fi.\" \"You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point,\" Remnant said. \"Your security guys in the airport aren't going to spot someone doing this because it's a technical thing,\" he added. Once connected, the hacker would have access to everything on your screen, from passwords, to bank account details, to the contents of e-mails. Do you suspect you've been a victim of Wi-Fi hacking? Tell us your story in Sound Off . And it's not just happening at airports. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Last month, Venice rolled out what is believed to be Europe's most extensive Wi-Fi network. According to mobile media company Jiwire, there are now more than 273,000 free and pay Wi-Fi locations in 140 countries. The majority can be found in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and France. And most hotspots are located in hotels, along with cafes and restaurants. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that tests and certifies Wi-Fi equipment, says the increased availability of Wi-Fi has not led to a rise in hacking cases. \"We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that,\" said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner. She said all Wi-Fi enabled devices have in-built security measures, and all users need to do is to switch them on. The most up-to-date wireless security system is WPA2, which provides greater protection than its predecessors WPA and WEP. \"If you're updating Facebook, or checking your personal e-mail or surfing the Web, there's really no reason at all to worry about using an open network,\" Davis-Felner said. \"Any kind of online shopping or banking or anything that would require you to exchange sensitive data over the airwaves, then we advise people to exercise caution.\" The best way to protect sensitive information is to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which encrypts the data moving to and from your laptop. Kiran Deshpande, president of AirTight Networks, had this advice for travelers: \"Connect only to the networks that you trust. Make sure that your communication is secure, disconnect the wireless when you stop using it, and maintain the list of wireless connections that you use on your laptop so that you don't accidentally connect to networks that may spring up when you're traveling.\""}]}

Climate change is threatening U.S. landmarks from the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A new study has revealed the full extent of the crisis facing America's most cherised landmarks - and says almost two dozen are at risk. They include Boston's historic districts, the Harriet Tubman National Monument in Maryland and an array of Nasa sites including the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The new report says the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour (left) to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center (right) are at risk, also named were The Castillo de San Marcos (top middle), the oldest masonry fort in North America and parts of Boston . Landmarks at risk include the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor, which was the entry point for 14 million immigrants from 1886 to 1924. Sea level has risen 12 inches (30 centimeters) around New York City over the past century, the report said. Then came Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which flooded most of Liberty Island and all of Ellis Island, destroying most of their infrastructure and forcing their closure for months. New York is now rebuilding electrical systems on the islands 'as much as 20 feet above sea level and designing the heating and air conditioning systems to withstand flooding,' the report said. Other sites at risk include the first permanent British colony in North America at Jamestown Island in Virginia, and historic Charleston, South Carolina. Another is Fort Monroe, where the first African slaves arrived in 1619 and where 250 years later they were given refuge as 'contraband' of the American Civil War, a move that paved the way for the abolition of slavery. Also under threat are the C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez National Monument in Keene, California with floods, rising sea levels and fires, scientists said on Tuesday. National Landmarks at Risk, a report published by the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, highlighted more than two dozen sites that potentially face serious natural disasters. 'The imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation's heritage and history,' Adam Markham, director of climate impacts at the union, a non-profit organization for science advocacy in Washington D.C. and the study's co-author, said in a statement. The report is not slated for publication in a scientific journal, said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist who co-authored the report. It said that reducing carbon emissions could minimize the predicted risks posed by climate change. 'We must prepare our cherished landmarks for these worsening climate impacts and take steps to make climate resilience a national priority,' the scientists wrote. Where could be affected? 'At the same time, we must work to minimize these risks in the future by reducing the carbon emissions that are causing climate change and its accompanying impacts.' The report highlights 30 at-risk locations chosen because the science behind the risks they face is robust, and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts already affecting the United States' cultural heritage, the team said. At some sites -\u00a0 such as Liberty and Ellis Islands and Cape Hatteras - steps have already been taken to prepare for these growing climate risks. At many other sites, such efforts have not yet begun. 'As these case studies illustrate, climate change is no longer a distant threat for others to worry about,' the team said. 'The consequences are already underway, with serious and growing risks to the places and communities we care about.' Alaska: Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Kivalina -- Bering Land Bridge National Monument and Shishmaref . California: Groveland -- C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez National Monument -- NASA Ames Research Center . Colorado: Mesa Verde National Park . Florida: Castillo de San Marcos, Fort Mose, St. Augustine's historic downtown, and the Lincolnville Historic District in St. Augustine -- Prehistoric shell structures at Ten Thousand Islands and Canaveral National Seashore -- NASA Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral . Hawaii: Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau and Pu'uhonua o H\u014dnaunau National Historic Parks . Louisiana: NASA Michoud Assembly Facility . Maryland: Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument -- Historic Annapolis and U.S. Naval Academy . Massachusetts: Boston's Faneuil Hall and the Blackstone Block Historic District . Mississippi: NASA Stennis Space Center . New Mexico: Bandelier National Monument and Santa Clara Pueblo . New York: Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island . North Carolina: Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . South Carolina: Charleston's Historic District . Texas: Johnson Space Center . Virginia: Historic Jamestown -- Fort Monroe National Monument -- NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Langley Research Center . The report concluded that action must be taken now. 'If future generations of Americans are to experience the joy and wonder that these extraordinary places engender, we must act now to protect them from the impacts of climate change today and prepare them for expected additional changes tomorrow. 'We must also take steps to minimize the risks of climate change in the future by taking immediate action to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet's temperature. 'The historic legacy of the United States is at stake.' Drastic change: The Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC one day may only be accessible by boat . Jamestown, Virginia - the first permanent English colony - could be completely inundated due to rising sea levels, and the nearby Fort Monroe, 'will become an island unto itself within 70 years,' Markham said. In the western United States, rising temperatures have led to an increase in wildfires by melting winter snowpacks earlier, leaving forests drier for longer, the report said. Among California's 20 largest fires since 1932, a dozen have happened since 2002, the report said. An unrelated report published on Monday showed that the California drought has cost thousands of jobs and $1.7 billion to farmers in the state's Central Valley. Governor Jerry Brown has partly blamed climate change for the drought. Earlier this months Scientists warned that vast glaciers in West Antarctica are locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming \u2013 and created incredible images show the effect the melt would have on some of the U.S\u2019s classic coastal city areas. Experts say the melt could add 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 meters) to current sea levels in a few hundred years and the images illustrate the impact this increase would have on cities including Miami, Boston and San Francisco. The photographs were developed by Pittsburgh-based digital artist Nickolay Lamm, based on sea level-rise mapping data from Climate Central. Watery Boston: This image shows what the city's Back Bay would look like if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with roads leading to the bay completely submerged . Soggy playing conditions: AT&T Park in San Francisco would need to become a water polo venue, according to Nickolay Lamm's digital imaging . Flooded: The San Diego Convention Center would be completely unusable if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with water almost encroaching onto the road next to it . Venice Beach: Los Angeles' famous coastal hot-spot might only be navigable by canoe in the future, with the beach totally submerged by the waters of the Pacific . Road to nowhere: Miami's Ocean Drive is a popular spot for a stroll and a cruise, but in a few hundred years it might be better suited to fishing expeditions . In the shocking pictures the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C is surrounded by water, Ocean Drive in Miami looks like it would only be navigable by boat and Crissy Field in San Francisco is mostly under water. And you'd need waders to walk around The San Diego Convention Center, according to the predictions. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Some scientists believe that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is affecting wind patterns around Antarctica, driving warmer waters towards the continent. Bob Ward, from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Although such extreme sea level rise is only likely to occur after several centuries of global warming, these startling images should help U.S politicians and the public to understand the scale of the risks created by climate change.' Alarming: The Boston Harbor Hotel will need more than a few sandbags in the future to keep the water out, if Climate Central is correct . San Francisco's Crissy Field may one day be completely submerged . How San Francisco's Crissy Field might one day look from above . Water sight: Harvard campus would make for a nice boating lake in the future, apparently . Soaked: The lush lawn in front of the Military College of South Carolina may be lost forever . Sea-ing is believing: San Diego's Coronado Island may one day be claimed by the ocean ."}]}

The 72-year-old, who achieved international acclaim for The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules, designed the Dorset, Vermont, mansion with his wife Janet. Their aim was to create a property that was both a work space and a retreat. The couple finished building it in 1989, and 25 years on, they are selling up. Novelist John Irving is selling his 8,300 square-foot five-bedroom home in Dorset, Vermont, for $3million . The luxury mansion, which sits on 11.53 acres, has a swimming pool and stunning views across the hills . The 8,300-square-foot estate, being sold through Sothebys, offers five large bedrooms, six bathrooms and most importantly for the award-winning author 'the ability to get up in the morning and simply go to work where you live'. It also has a gym with a full-sized wrestling court, allowing Mr Irving to practice his beloved sport, all spread across across nearly 12 acres of private land equipped with tennis courts and a pool. There is also a large office where Mr Irving would spend up to nine hours a day writing. He would have to wear a hat and sunglasses while at his desk because so much light is let in. A large shower, bathroom and private sauna complete the first floor. The master bedroom offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The writer holds up his Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay with The Cider House Rules in 2000. After 25 years living in the Vermont house with his wife, he has decided to move to an apartment in Toronto . Mr Irving, who achieved critical acclaim for his novels including The World According to Garp and Cider House Rules, said he wanted to create a home which could be both a retreat and a place of work . One of the reasons he chose the location was because of the spectacular views of the Green Mountains . The property has a gym which includes a range of equipment including rowing machines and exercise bikes . 'It's not only the house that I've been in the longest,' says the writer, 'but I have to say, it's been a very happy period in my life that I've been living here.' According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Irving fitted the home with furniture she said wasn't 'precious' and could be used by the family. Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of The World According to Garp in 1978. The Cider House Rules (1985), which was later turned into a film starring Michael Caine, and A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), have also been bestsellers. The room also has a full-sized wrestling court. Photos show Irving playing the sport as he grew up. He was a wrestling coach as well as a wrestler in high school and college . In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He is now said to be finishing his 14th novel, Avenue of Mysteries, about an older Mexican-American man who travels to the Philippines and reflects on his childhood in Mexico. The couple are now moving to their apartment in Toronto. Mr Irving's main concern, according to the Journal, is that he won't have enough room for the hundreds of family photos he has of his family. Pictured is the novelist's author where he spends up to eight hours a day writing by hand . Potential petrol-headed residents will be able to fit three cars in this enormous garage that sits at the back of the sprawling property . Around the side of the house is a stone terrace which also offers spectacular views of the surrounding area . The master suite offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The dining room, which has easy access to the wet bar and kitchen, is perfect for entertaining guests . Ms Irving is said to have fitted the home with furniture she did not consider to be 'precious' so it could be used by all members of the family . Following a day of working or walking in the surroundings, the new owners can sit in front of the television or simply stare out into the surrounding gardens . A breakfast bar separates the dining table and the kitchen. Book shelves cover the walls around the house . After a long day of writing, Mr Irving enjoys to cook in this spacious kitchen. A mock street sign with his name above hangs on the wall . A piano sits in one of the hallways that line the front and back of the house . If the gym and wrestling are not enough - there is also a full-size tennis court in the grounds ."}]}

The Olympic heptathlon champion received threatening messages via Twitter last month, with one user writing he hoped Evans raped Ennis-Hill, after saying she would want her name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans returned. Ennis-Hill spoke out after United accepted a request from the Professional Footballers' Association to allow Evans to train with his former club following the striker's release from prison, midway through a five-year sentence. United later withdrew the offer. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill urged Sheffield United not to re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans . In an interview with BBC Sport, Ennis-Hill said of the abuse: 'It was definitely a shock. It was not very nice to read them but unfortunately that's the world we live in. 'You kind of have to keep focused on who you are and what you believe in, and try not to read too much into it. 'You can't spend hours going through your Twitter feed and reading everything every single person says to you. You need to get on with your life.' Ennis-Hill was one of several high-profile figures to enter the debate over Evans after United initially said he would be allowed to train. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 1960s pop star Dave Berry and health adviser Lindsay Graham all stood down as club ambassadors during the row. 'I knew I was in a position where I was going to upset someone whether I said something or didn't,' Ennis-Hill said. 'With my stand at Sheffield United and the association I have with the club, I really just wanted to voice my opinion. Ennis-Hill, pictured at the Shard on Wednesday night, received plenty of Twitter abuse from supporters . 'It wasn't about putting pressure on the club or anything like that - it was just simply about how I felt. I think people can be rehabilitated and if they have served time in jail can go back into society, but I just feel that when you are in a really privileged position it's quite different.' Ennis-Hill, 28, is now focused on getting back into competitive shape after giving birth to her son Reggie in July, and she is hoping to defend her Olympic title in Rio in 2016. 'It's hard getting up when you have not had much sleep but I really want to have this last push in my career,' she said of her return to training. 'I'm looking forward to the Olympics, I really want to be there and want to be a contender and that's what keeps me motivated. 'I have two years to get the work done and get where I was, I'm still the competitive person I was and I really hope I can contend for a gold medal. 'London 2012 was fantastic and it will be very hard to top, but if I am able to get work done and get to Rio and win a gold medal having had a child, that would be unbelievable.'"}]}

Cheryl Prudham, 32, and husband Rob, 29, who are expecting twin girls in September, were pictured last month in shorts and flip-flops soaking up the sun on a break with their brood in Menorca, Spain. They stayed at the three-star Hotel Victoria Playa in Santo Tomas, which has two swimming pools and a beach nearby, and Mrs Prudham claimed she was not concerned about using taxpayers\u2019 money. Cheryl Prudham, 32, defended her use of taxpayers' cash for her holiday with children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one . The mother, who lives in a five-bedroom council house with her family in Gravesend, Kent, told Closer magazine: \u2018I don\u2019t feel bad about using taxpayers\u2019 money. We\u2019re entitled to a holiday. \u2018We spent our days going for walks on the beach, having toasties by the pool and watching the hotel entertainment in the evenings.

She added: \u2018I asked the school headmaster if we could get time off, but he said \"no\". So we decided to go anyway. One of the weeks was during half term, so they haven\u2019t missed that much school. \u2018We didn\u2019t want to wait until the summer as it\u2019s too hot to go away then. If we get fined we\u2019ll have to deal with it. We\u2019d pay it off gradually - there\u2019s no way we could afford a big lump sum.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t put a limit on how many more children I\u2019ll have.

'It\u2019s . none of anybody else\u2019s business. Other people like us go on holiday all . the time and it doesn\u2019t matter if it is in England or abroad, it all . costs the same'.

It is up to . us when we go on holiday\u2019, Mr Prudham said. Mrs . Prudham, who posted a selfie with her husband on Facebook while on . holiday, was also seen smoking while her children were splashing in the . pool. When asked how she could justify a fortnight abroad, she told The Sun last month: 'We can't even enjoy a family holiday'. Abroad: The also admitted headteachers had warned them not to go on holiday in term time, but they went anyway, which means they face fines of \u00a360 per child - a total of \u00a3840 .

Mrs Prudham said: \u2018For one, I work more hours than what they are saying and two, I'm going to be sterilised. I'm going to have a caesarean and I'm going to get sterilised at the same time. \u2018I'm glad that I am pregnant with twins and I am amazed by it. It\u2019s not anybody else's business. I do a job that most people couldn't do. I care for the elderly every single day.\u2019 Home life: This is the Prudams' council house in Gravesend, Kent, but they want to move again because they do not like the area .

They used to live in a tiny home in Sittingbourne, Kent, and first demanded a new home last year after hearing about other families on benefits who had landed huge properties. They repeatedly bid for new council . homes through Kent Homechoice, which works alongside Kent County . Council. However, they were left furious when they were turned down by . the authority. Instead they agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, who wanted to downsize.

A Canadian railway is suing the mother of man killed by one of its trains \u2013 giving the heartbroken woman until exactly two years to the day of the accident to answer the suit.Sharon Jobson, of Glencoe, Ontario, has until July 29 to answer a $500,000 lawsuit from CN Rail brought against the grieving mother for damages and train delays incurred through her 22-year-old son John Jobson\u2019s negligence despite the crossing still not having adequate signage and warnings, according to reports.\u2018We thought we had a happy ending. Lights and gates are going up in the next two weeks \u2014 they\u2019ve already been delivered . . .\u00a0 I think everyone thought it was a good ending to a tragic story. This is just really a shock to everyone,\u2019 Sharon Jobson told the Toronto Star. Dead: John Jobson, 22, died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train, now the railroad is suing his mother for damages . Despite Sharon Jobson, 50, persuading the rail operator to budget over $400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings, the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates, yet the CN Rail felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate, according to CTV.John Jobson is \u2018wholly responsible\u2019 for costs related to rail repair and a \u2018bottleneck of rail traffic,\u2019 according to a copy of the suit obtained by the Toronto Star. The suit goes on to say that Jobson failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling \u2018at an excessive rate of speed\u2019 over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train, the paper reported. John Jobson died six days later at a local hospital. \u2018He created a situation of danger . . . (and) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing,\u2019 the paper reported the suit said.Of the 116 passengers on-board the VIA train, six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision, according to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Pay up: CN Rail says negligence caused the collision and that the $500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother Sharon Jobson . Unsafe: The suit was brought against Sharon Jobson despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded . The history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which John Jobson had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a Canadian Pacific Railway train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred, according to the TSB report. Adequate signage and warnings were installed at the CP crossing shortly after the incident, the TSB report noted.Despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where John Jobson\u2019s pickup truck was hit, CN Rail neglected to upgrade the crossing\u2019s warning systems, which the TSB said were \u2018situated too low,\u2019 to sufficiently warn drivers.Also a hindrance to John Jobson being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn\u2019s position \u2013 instead of being at the front of the locomotive, it was in the middle of the head car, making it harder to hear, according to the TSB report. Crushed: Sharon Jobson's son is dead because a train hit him, and now the railway wants her to pony up $400,000 . The devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad, saying it was never about the money.\u2018We were happy with getting some safety measures in place. We never were seeking anything financial,\u2019 she told the Star, adding \u2018I was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that won\u2019t be happening too soon.\u2019Both the railway and Sharon Jobson are declining to comment publicly on the suit, with Sharon Jobson only telling CTV \u2018I don\u2019t want to be doing this at this time.I just want to have a peaceful time.'"}]}

During the incident, the SS Mont-Blanc - a ship from France fully loaded with wartime explosives - collided with SS Imo from Norway . Experts say the blast was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons - with an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Amateur photographer Victor, who was based in Halifax in the Canadian state of Nova Scotia, was said to 'always had a camera around his neck' and was able to grab a series of shots of the original 'big bang'. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, who discovered them among photo albums in a drawer. She had no idea a slice of history had been gathering dust in her home for nearly 100 years. Mrs Foreman, from Hayle in Cornwall, who served in the land army, will take them to the Imperial War Museum, London, next month to have the photos looked at. She said: 'My father was a great photographer. He always had a camera around his neck. He would take photos all the time. He never asked anyone to pose or anything. He just snapped away. 'It was just a coincidence that he was at the Halifax disaster. The actual explosion was a a massive amount of smoke. Experts say the blast, the aftermath of which is shown here, was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons . 'The Halifax Explosion' had an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT and left a a trail of destruction in its wake . The photos were taken by Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, - the young sailor 'always had a camera around his neck' 'He was very lucky to survive, especially as it destroyed the town. He took some photos on the shore and it looked like the London Blitz. 'The whole situation of finding the photos has made it very real. I'm just so proud of him. He never talked about this and this is the first time seeing them. It's extraordinary.' After the war, Victor went back to his job as a Marine Underwriter in Essex, before serving in the home guard during the Second World War. Although later leaving the role to become an apple farmer, he always loved the sea and was the Commodore of Essex Yacht Club. He was married for his whole life, had three children and six grandchildren, and died in 1969. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, from Hayle, Cornwall, who discovered them among photo albums . The explosion, at 9.04am on Thursday December 6, 1917, happened in the the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the French ship then ignited her explosive cargo causing a cataclysmic explosion that devastated the Richmond District of Halifax. It was so powerful it almost wiped out the entire town and around 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, and collapsed buildings and more than 9,000 injured. 1.

Port Chicago disaster on 17 July 1944: 1.6-2.2 kt of TNT (7-9 TJ) Two ships, one loaded with explosive, struck each other while the town shock with horror. SS Mont Blanc was described as a huge 'floating bomb' because of her formidable cargo. There were more than 2,000 tonnes of picric acid, 200 tonnes of TNT, 56 tonnes of gun cotton and 223 tonnes of motor fuel on board. Records show the ship exploded and disintegrated in seconds. Altogether 3.8 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Halifax was flattened in an instant and more than 1,900 people perished. The SS Mont Blanc was completely destroyed, with its hull launched 1,000ft in the air, while the SS Imo survived and returned to service in 1918. As the ships collided, Lt Montague was on the shore with his camera in hand, snapping the event. His daughter is expected to visit the Imperial War Museum on December 2, where an expert will talk through the photos with her. Dr Robb Robinson, a lecturer in Maritime History at Hull University, said: 'It was 1917 and the Germans had just unleashed submarine warfare, causing massive problems for the allies. There was a big push by the Germans to win the war. 'To try and stop this, the allies launched a convoy system with ships staying sailing close to each other. This left them vulnerable to collision. 'Secondly, so many ships had been sunk that ships that weren't right for the job were being used. 'Thirdly, they were drawing increasingly on Canada and the USA for ammunition, so ships were being filled with ammunition before sailing over. 'It lead to the most devastating explosion there had every been at the time. Before Hiroshima, every explosion was judged on how it compared to Halifax. 'This explosion was a precursor of things to come throughout the century.'"}]}

At just 29, Brisbane mother-of-two Yasmin Rajah is faced with the harrowing reality that she will not see her young sons grow up. 'I think to myself all day, what about my boys... what can I do to make sure that they remember me,' she said. Ms Rajah suffers an extremely rare form of cancer that is likely to kill her, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair. 'I may not be around past Christmas and expected case is a couple of years,' she said. Scroll down for video . Yasmin Rajah and her partner Ryan Price have two young sons Josiah (left) and Jazz (right) At just 29, Ms Rajah could have just months to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . After going to a doctor believing she had a broken rib in July, tests revealed a cancerous tumour about the size of a grapefruit and squashing her heart. Diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, mature teratoma with a malignant adenocarcinoma differentiation, it has since spread to her bones and spine, reducing her chance of survival to just five per cent despite the tumour being removed from her right lung through open heart surgery. The form of cancer is so rare that little research has been done on it. After learning she had the disease, Ms Rajah said her first concern was her family - partner Ryan Price and their sons Jazz, eight, and five-year-old Josiah. The couple have been together for eight years and are now planning to marry thanks to the generosity of the community . Ms Rajah said her first concern after being diagnosed with the cancer was her family, including sons Jazz (left) and Josiah (right) Jazz said he hoped his mum could stay clam, be strong and get rid of the cancer as quick as a 'flash'. 'We did tell the boys that mummy was going to beat cancer and going to live, but things have changed,' Yasmin said. Her partner Ryan described Ms Rajah's condition as a sinking boat. 'There's a hole in it and no matter how much water you scope out, it's not helping - it just sinks,' he said. 'I love her with cancer, I love her without cancer, I love her with hair, I love her without hair.' Mr Price said he loves his partner with or without her cancer . While the couple initially told their sons Ms Rajah would beat cancer, her condition has since worsened . The couple met eight years ago in a bar where Ms Rajah performed and Mr Price said as soon as he saw her, he hoped she would talk to him and they are now planning on getting married. 'It means a lot to be a complete family unit,' Ms Rajah said, regardless of whether a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper to some people. Ms Rajah previously gave her first engagement ring to a minister who lost his home in a flood because she had no money to offer. In in act of complete kindness, Mr Price contacted Brisbane radio station B105, which is helping the couple get married with businesses and the public donating wedding rings, a wedding dress, venue hire, hair, make-up, catering and a bucks and hens night. A Brisbane radio station is helping the couple get married after Mr Price informed them about his partner's condition . A local business donated Ms Rajah's engagement ring, pictured, and also the couple's wedding ring . Since the radio broadcast information about Mr Price's letter, businesses and members of the public have donated goods and services for the wedding . Ms Rajah said the wedding plans had been a great distraction form her illness. Flight Centre has since teamed up with the radio station to create an online fundraiser at Givex.com so the couple can take their sons with them on a trip to Disneyland LA. The company has put $3,000 into the fund, which aims to raise $30,000 by the end of the month. 'This is the hardest thing I know I'll ever have to go through in my entire life,' Mr Price said. 'I hope that if things don't go as well as expected, that they (her sons and partner) know that I love them - that's it', Ms Rajah said."}]}

A . used-car salesman has been jailed for life for murdering his estranged wife, . their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family . home after his marriage collapsed. Danai . Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he . killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching . the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent. Melissa\u2019s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe . burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 . last year and he died six days later. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court, told Iraqi-born Muhammadi that he will spend at least 38 years behind bars before being eligible for parole. Happier times: Melissa Crook and her future killer Danai Muhammadi on their wedding day . The court heard how Muhammadi . and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the . letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out . at the base of the stairs. The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold. As . smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Melissa . collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters . lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt. Amid . the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, . causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back . inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape. Her . husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following . his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But . 26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew . the windows out. He . suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in . East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in . the intensive care unit. He died six days later. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts . of murder. Muhammadi and Mahmud were both also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder. Muhammadi\u2019s . new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of . murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts . of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. The judge said that while she was not the principal figure, she was a 'joint perpetrator in the common venture to burn the house'. Scene of tragedy: The Crook family home in Chatham, Kent, was left gutted after the blaze . Escape: Melissa's brother Bohdan Crook (left) broke his feet and hands when he jumped from the burning house while her mother Amanda watched in horror as her husband burned after becoming stuck in the window . Judge Sweeney said the actions of Muhammadi 'can truly be described as pure, selfish wickedness' - adding that Melissa Crook and Noah 's last moments, trapped by the flames, must have been 'of abject terror. He said: 'No-one who heard the evidence in this case will ever forget Mrs Crook\u2019s description of how, as he tried to escape, her husband became stuck in the bedroom window and how, unable to extricate himself, she had to stand and watch as his lower half was burned. 'It\u2019s no thanks to you two that Amanda Crook and Bohdan Crook escaped the fate that you intended for them. 'Each suffered significant injuries, the effects - whether physical or mental - they are still clearly suffering from today.' Mr Justice Sweeney acknowledged that Muhammadi was the 'principal offender', adding: 'The enterprise was all your idea and you drove it forward to its conclusion.' He said that Mahmud\u2019s actions were borne out of 'misguided friendship' with Muhammadi and his expectation of significant financial gain from him. Mahmud was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years prison before being eligible for parole. Muhammadi's girlfriend Smith showed no emotion as she was jailed for 14 years. The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son . The judge told her: 'You joined the enterprise because you were the girlfriend of Danai Muhammadi. 'It was an on-off relationship in which, as I have already said when passing his sentence, he used you to get Melissa back.' He added that like both Muhammadi and Mahmud, Smith had shown not 'a spark of genuine remorse' for her actions. In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated. Smith . had started a relationship with Mrs Crook\u2019s estranged husband, Danai . Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted Melissa . about their 'great life together'. Smith also mocked Mrs Crook . about her size, for being 'boring' in the bedroom and added: 'Enjoy your . life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.' Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt 'sick' when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the . fire that killed three generations of her family. Mrs . Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her . 22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa\u2019s brother - but both said the end of . the court case would not bring them closure. She said: 'We weren\u2019t . just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his . wife and his own child and his father-in-law. 'He\u2019s taken away our whole lives, just because of his greed, and that\u2019s all it was. It was greed. There was no reason to do what he did.'"}]}

Claims: Dave Lee Travis, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, says he had to sell his house to fight assault allegations against him . Dave Lee Travis told a court he has a \u2018cuddly nature\u2019 but denied being a \u2018sexual predator\u2019. Speaking from the witness box yesterday, the former Radio 1 DJ said he \u2018loves women\u2019 because they are \u2018wonderful\u2019 and have\u00a0 \u2018fabulous shapes\u2019. The 68-year-old said he did not have a predatory nature with women, but admitted he did \u2018hug a lot of girls\u2019. \u2018If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,\u2019 he told the court. \u2018Perhaps hugging is something which can be misconstrued by some people or if people are looking for an excuse they can say \u201che touched us\u201d. I did hug a lot of girls. \u2018But nowadays you can\u2019t do that apparently\u2009\u2026\u2009So it is an unfortunate trait I suppose.\u2019 Travis described his colourful career as a \u2018big name\u2019 DJ at Radio 1 \u2013 but told Southwark Crown Court he could not do what he wanted. Travis spoke of his passion for photography and admitted he has taken pictures of naked and semi-naked women for a book he published. But he insisted that the pictures were not \u2018tacky\u2019 and said he did not use his hobby to prey on women. \u2018I love women,\u2019 he told the jury. \u2018I think they are wonderful.\u2019 He added: \u2018Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes.\u2019 Among the allegations against him, Travis is accused of\u00a0 sneaking into a Radio 4 studio and groping a presenter as she introduced Woman\u2019s Hour live on air in the early 1980s. Denying the attack, he said: \u2018I would be at a bit of a loose end understanding it to be quite honest with you.\u2019 He said he would have been hauled before a station boss if he had dared to interrupt a Radio 4 programme. On the stand: A sketch of Travis giving evidence in his own defence at the court today . On trial: The veteran former DJ denies assaulting 11 alleged victims over a period of more than three decades . \u2018I agree I was a big name in Radio 1, but there were quite a few big names. You did not do what you wanted at the BBC,\u2019 he said. Years later he met the woman at a party where he took a photograph of her. He . said: \u2018Everything seemed to be fine. That was a serious thing that in . her mind had happened. Why would she suddenly be posing and smiling for . me and for the camera? \u2018I . thought she was great, I thought she was fabulous, a really nice lady. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get this. On the rare occasions I met her, I thought . she was superb.\u2019 Denial: Travis said that although he loves women's 'shapes' he is not a sexual predator . Travis, . who is being tried under his real name of Dave Patrick Griffin, was also . questioned over claims he pushed his hand up the skirt of a newsreader . while he was working for Classic Gold radio station in the early 2000s. \u2018This is not something you would do if you are a normal human being,\u2019 the DJ told the court. \u2018It\u2019s astonishing because I even thought, and I said to police, that she was wearing trousers.\u2019 When . asked about whether it had ever been suggested he had a reputation for . being a \u2018sexual predator\u2019 at the station, he said: \u2018No, no one said a . thing about it. \u2018You can\u2019t sexually assault a woman and expect people would not say anything. I would fully expect to be kicked out.\u2019 He . added: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but this is my reputation I have spent 50 years . building up \u2013 I\u2019m not going to let it all go to pot over something a kid . made up.\u2019 Travis insisted . he left Classic Gold in 2002 due to disagreements over music selection, . and not as a result of allegations of sexual assault. Travis, . of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault . dating back to between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in . 2008. The trial continues. Dave Lee Travis cried himself to sleep after being accused of assaulting women and said the allegations had ruined his life and career, a court heard today. The veteran DJ claimed he had been 'screwed backwards' by the claims, telling police his wife Marianne was ill with breast cancer at the time they emerged. He also said he had been forced to sell his home to fight the allegations, which he said had been made up by his accusers in a bid to 'make money'. Today jurors heard extracts from a police interview with Travis on September 18 last year, 10 months after he was first arrested. Couple: Travis said that his wife Marianne, right, was suffering from breast cancer at the time the allegations first surface . 'Mr Travis said that for 10 months he . had lost his money, work, his health, he has had back and knee . operations and had suffered stress,' said junior prosecutor Teresa Hay. 'Worse . still, his wife had suffered breast cancer. She was through it now but . stress is bad for someone who is going through that. 'This . was costing him his job, his living and everything he has built up over . 50 years. For him these allegations don't stand up. He and his wife had . suffered badly.' He said his accuser was 'out to make money' and asked: 'Why wait 20 years until it comes out in one-sided press coverage?' 'This is just someone else who can smell money and is jumping into the game to see what they can get out of it,' he told police. Ms Hay said Travis told police that 'he has been screwed . backwards - he is selling his house to pay for solicitors and . barristers. 'People might think he is a millionaire but his bank account is non-existent. 'His . life has changed for the worse and he is full of anger. Even if he is . acquitted he still won't be free. He has cried at night.' Home: Travis told police he had been forced to sell his house in Buckinghamshire, pictured, to pay his legal bills . The . jury heard that Travis was questioned in relation to allegations that . he groped a woman while dancing the Lambada at two British Airways . parties in the early 1990s. He . told police he would provide musical entertainment at such parties, . often wearing fancy dress, but could not remember those events in . particular. Asked about claims that he had told . the woman she had 'won the keys to his room', he claimed it was not the . type of thing he would say. He went on: 'It is just because she saw a picture of me in the paper next to Jimmy Savile. It is nonsense.' Travis . also told police that he had 'great sympathy' with rape victims and had . been involved in attempts to stop it in his work for children's . charities. 'But he didn't see the similarity between this and grabbing a girl's bum in a dance,' Ms Hay said. The . court has previously heard claims that Travis molested a teenager at a . Showaddywaddy concert and assaulted a woman in the BBC studio while . broadcasting his Radio 1 show. He . is also accused of attacking a theatre worker in his dressing room . while appearing in panto, stopping only when one of the Chuckle Brothers . walked past. Dave . Lee Travis groped a journalist's bottom while they were playing a . flight simulator game on his computer, a court heard today. The . German woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was visiting his . home in Buckinghamshire to interview him about Beat Club, a TV show . which he once presented. She . told jurors she was 'embarrassed and taken aback' by the DJ's 'sleazy' behaviour during the alleged incident in August 2005, which followed a . 90-minute interview. Travis invited the woman to play his favourite game and stood behind her as she began to play, the court heard. 'That's when he put his hand on a . shoulder, ran it down my back and rested it on the left cheek of my . bum,' she said. 'It was an extremely uncomfortable moment. 'I was completely taken aback, it was just unexpected. I felt it was sleazy, there was absolutely no option for me than to move. 'I was rather embarrassed and I was embarrassed for him about this kind of behaviour, it was just so inappropriate.' Star: The claims against Travis date back to the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter in the 1970s . The reporter said that after the incident she 'pretended it didn't happen', while Travis appeared 'sheepish'. She asked Travis to give her a lift to the local train station, where she took a photograph of the pair together. 'I . did feel it was a really embarrassing situation and it was, I guess an . attempt to make light of the situation,' the woman told the court. She said that the DJ 'pulled her towards him and we ended up standing cheek to cheek', adding: 'That's not the photograph I wanted. 'I have interviewed many, many famous people in my journalistic career and most of the time they are pleasant people. 'My only explanation was that he must have felt really sheepish about what happened. 'I think the situation was so awkward, it was obvious this elderly gentleman who I had never heard of before completely crossed the line. It must have been embarrassing for him.' The alleged victim confided in her partner but did not complain about the incident, saying 'it would have been very difficult' to lodge an official complaint. 'For me the situation was so embarrassing, it was so strange, I didn't feel I wanted to complain to someone,' she said. 'I sometimes thought in retrospect it would have been the smarter or braver thing to do at the time.' She eventually came forward after hearing of Travis' arrest in November 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel. In a televised address carried by Hezbollah's station al Manar, Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people. Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni-led governments in the Arab world. But Nasrallah's language Monday came close to promoting their overthrow. The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt's affairs. In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt, Nasrallah said the militia's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation. Nasrallah's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government. The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down last month, and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government. At the same time, tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, Saad's father, in 2005. Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination, describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States. Saad Hariri says his party won't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal. Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri's death on February 14. The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications, construction and other businesses. He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis, Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon's many parties. Some Lebanese politicians, notably the veteran Nabih Berri, a Shiite, are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week. Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal's indictments, which for now are sealed. Lebanon's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex. Some Christian families, notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party, are allied with the Sunni Hariri's party and want to see Hezbollah's wings clipped. Besides its political strength, Hezbollah's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel. But another prominent Christian, Michel Aoun, is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah. And Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the minority Druze community, has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah, even though Jumblat's father was killed by the Syrians. Aoun was brutally honest about his choice: \"We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah.\" In other words, the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon. Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other."}]}

She and her friend could face up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admitted earlier in the month, \u00a0that the reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', the Sunday Telegraph\u00a0wrote. 'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said. It came just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, said he planned to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death. Amira Karroum (pictured) was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria . Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011 . During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's\u00a0A Current Affair program,\u00a0Mohamed Karroum said he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'. In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum told journalist Lisa Goddard: 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.' In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands . Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali. The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah' Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities. 'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.' He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court. 'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'"}]}

The management plan draft claims that the term 'wilderness'\u00a0is 'deeply problematic for Tasmanian Aboriginal people and is conceptually alien to Aboriginal understanding of country'. Outraged conservationists have objected to the Tasmanian governments bold new plans which would see the 'wilderness' title removed from the state's Wilderness World Heritage area label . It further claims that the management of the region for wilderness values is a 'denial of their rights to access country and conduct cultural practices.' Vica Bayley, the Wilderness Society's Tasmanian campaign manager labelled the statement an 'extremely manipulative and deceptive argument', as the Tasmanian government had only recently expanded four wheel drive tracks over sacred Aboriginal middens in the north-west of the area. Tasmania's Liberal government provided $300,000 for the controversial development, which would see 90 kilometers of track upgraded and reopened, reported The ABC. The move was met with outrage by the Aboriginal community, as the area was home to countless rock engravings, middens, and hut depressions. 'This is completely tourism and development driven. If this is an example of 'sensitive development' then the community can have zero confidence in the plan,' he said.

The 1.5 million hectare region, which covers approximately a quarter of the state, will be reclassified from the current 'wilderness zone' to a 'natural zone', effectively removing the strict guidelines for development and tourism in the area, including Frenchmans Cap and Franklin River, in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (above) Matthew Groom, Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, confirmed in a statement that 'selective special species timber harvesting was already permitted in a small number of zones within the area.' 'The draft plan is about achieving balanced outcomes that are genuinely respectful of cultural and natural values, while at the same time recognising that the TWWHA is an area to be used, celebrated and shared with the world,' Mr Groom said. While the official title will remain unchanged, Mr Bayley has labelled the proposal a threat to the integrity of the iconic landscape of the state. 'Doing away with the wilderness zone impacts on the credibility and integrity of the brand of Tasmania, and our state's claim as wilderness,' he said. Mr Bayley said that the state trades on the 'idea of wilderness', and that it was a key motivating factor for people to visit.

'The Tasmanian government is seeking to facilitate sensible and appropriate recreational experiences including new tourism opportunities through the EOI process,' said Mr Groom. 'This plan is all about managing the area properly while ensuring we can use it to generate tourism and jobs,' he said. Several of the objectives included in the draft include 'commercial opportunities', 'the support of management through tourism', and 'the balanced use of aircraft'. The draft states that the Tasmanian government acknowledges the 'important role tourism plays in contributing to the economic wellbeing of the Tasmanian community.' Mr Bayley said that the changes showed a lessening of the state government's commitment to protect the area, shown through the  removal of the pledge included in the previous management plan  to 'strive to maintain the property and leave it in as good or better quality than it was found'.

Former NFL player Perrish Cox today walked free after being acquitted of sexual assault charges, a verdict that was met with disbelief by the alleged victim. A jury found ex-Denver Broncos cornerback Cox not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman at his apartment in September 2010 despite DNA evidence and eyewitness testimony. The woman fell pregnant after the alleged attack following a night out at a Denver nightclub, and DNA tests showed that Cox was the father of the baby. Scroll down for video . Not guilty: Former Denver Broncos cornerback Perrish Cox rests his head before he is acquitted in sexual assault trial . When the verdict was read out Cox hugged . his attorney, while the alleged victim cried out in disbelief. As she was leaving the courtroom, she said, 'Oh my God, what's . happening?' Cox expressed appreciation for his attorney, Harvey Steinberg, and others who supported him during the trial. 'I love my lawyer and everybody else who's been,' with me, he said. Steinberg had disputed the DNA test results and suggested they may have been contaminated. During the cross-examination of witnesses, he tried to paint a picture of drunkenness and of the alleged victim being able to interact with people without remembering. 'We always felt there were substantial holes in the case,' he said after the verdict. 'We had hoped they (the jury) would see those same holes.' Jurors left the courthouse without commenting. Cox denied having sex with the woman, who testified that she believed she was drugged because she remembers little about what happened. Cox was charged with one count of sexual assault while the victim was physically helpless and one count of sexual assault while the victim was incapable of determining the nature of the conduct. He faced two years to life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors had laid out what they believed was a straightforward case. They cited the DNA evidence, as well as testimony from Cox's teammate, Demaryius Thomas, who said he saw Cox carry her onto his bed and say, 'she's ready.' Prosecutor Chris Gallo said Cox's statement showed what state of mind he was in. Gallo told jurors that Cox expected to have sex with another woman at the apartment, Carthy Che, who testified she was sick. And there was the alleged victim, lying on his bed and 'ready.' Shock verdict: Cox's acquittal was met with disbelief by the alleged victim . Relief: Cox, right, with his attorney Harvey Steinberg, who he embraced after the verdict was read out .

'I . never raped nobody,' Cox told the detective as both spoke in loud . voices. 'I'm losing it because, seriously, I never touched this girl.' The interview ends with Cox asking: 'I'm going to jail? You're kidding me. What am I supposed to do? I didn't.' Cox . also told the detectives that Che, who he was dating at the time, was . also at the apartment. He said he could have had sex with her if he . wanted sex. Young player: Cox, 25, was a rookie out of Oklahoma State who had played eight games for the Broncos when he was arrested . Cox, 25, was a rookie out of Oklahoma State who had played eight games for the Broncos when he was arrested. His legal troubles capped a tumultuous time for the Broncos, who had dealt with the drive-by slaying of cornerback Darrent Williams on New Year's Day 2007, running back Damien Nash's fatal heart attack in March 2007 and receiver Kenny McKinley's suicide in September 2010. The Broncos said they had no comment on the verdict since Cox no longer is with the organization. Prosecutors said they wouldn't immediately comment on the verdict. The accuser's attorney, Craig Silverman, didn't respond to a request for comment. Steinberg said he realised the trial was a terrible ordeal for the woman.

Thousands of sixth- formers are opting to take a tough research-based qualification on top of A-levels amid a collapse of confidence in the exam. More than 30,000 teenagers are expected to submit dissertations under the Extended Project Qualification this year, a six-fold increase in four years. The qualification can be used as a \u2018tie-breaker\u2019 between university applicants with similar A-level results, or to decide whether to admit someone who has failed to meet their grade offer. Thousands of sixth- formers are opting to take a tough research-based qualification on top of A-levels amid a collapse of confidence in the exam . The work, which is worth the equivalent of half an A-level, is usually presented as a 5,000-word report in an academic subject \u2018outside their main programme of study\u2019. It requires a high level of independent work and original thought \u2013 skills which universities complain are lacking in school leavers. Private schools in particular have recognised the value of the exam and around 6 per cent of pupils took one last year, a third more than in 2011. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: \u2018My guess is that the number of students taking them will continue to increase. Ofqual research has revealed that universities are keen to see an increase in independent research and learning. There is an inadequate amount at A-level, so EPQs are absolutely up universities\u2019 street. \u2018Some universities also find A-levels not stretching enough for the most able students. The EPQ does stretch them.\u2019 Just over 5,000 EPQs were submitted in 2009. This leapt to 16,000 the following year and 24,000 in 2011. Last year 28,500 students sat the qualification, which is offered by five exam boards and uses the same grading system as A-levels. Of these, 14 per cent were awarded an A*, 19.3 per cent an A and 19.8 per cent a B. Education Secretary Michael Gove is reforming A-levels after the gold-standard exam suffered from years of grade inflation . Elite universities said EPQs can make the difference between winning a place on a course or just missing out. But institutions outside the research-intensive 24 Russell Group universities are also increasingly relying on them. Education Secretary Michael Gove is reforming A-levels after the gold-standard exam suffered from years of grade inflation. Modular work is being replaced by exams at the end of courses. The number of resits is also being limited. But the changes will only be introduced from 2015, meaning it will be several years before students sit more rigorous exams. The Extended Project Qualification was introduced in 2008. Students can choose the topic they research but it must be an academic area not specifically covered in their other studies. Someone studying French and geography could write about the impact of tourism on the\u00a0 environment in a region of France, for example. The qualification takes a year during which students receive 120 \u2018guided learning hours\u2019 and undertake \u2018extended autonomous work\u2019."}]}

Amy McStein, from Liverpool, gave up her university education and job prospects to fulfil her dream of becoming a mother. She took the drastic decision after doctors told her a gynaecological condition she was suffering from was getting worse - and it was only a matter of time before she would need her womb removed. Amy McStein (pictured with baby Ava Grace), 22, was diagnosed with severe endometriosis when she was just 19 and was told she would need a hysterectomy as soon as possible . Ms McStein, now 22, was suffering from endometriosis - a painful condition in which small pieces of the womb lining are found elsewhere in the body. Her condition was diagnosed after she suffered years of agony, resulting in her suddenly collapsing . during a family meal in the summer of 2010. \u2018Despite . going back and forth to the doctors, I was told time and time again . that it was just normal period pain. I felt totally helpless,\u2019 she said. \u2018Then one day, I was out for dinner . with my family when I felt a sudden, sharp pain in my stomach. It took . my breath away and before I knew it, I woke up on the floor. I had . fainted. \u2018I spent all night in accident and emergency and doctors finally dismissed it as trapped wind. Doctors warned Amy that if she wanted to be a mother she should start trying immediately so she dropped out of university to try for a child with her partner, Jack . Ava will be two in December and Amy is now preparing for her hysterectomy which is expected to take place within the next year . \u2018A few weeks later, in July 2010, I collapsed again and doctors found a five centimetre diameter cyst on my right ovary.\u2019 Ms McStein was transferred to Liverpool . Women\u2019s Hospital where she had a minor operation to drain the cyst. Waking after the procedure, she was told the news. She said: \u2018I had severe endometriosis, and had to be started on a drug to induce menopause straight away. \u2018The bombshell utterly floored me. I . was just 19 years old.

I thought I had my whole life ahead of me. Ms McStein, . who was studying forensic science at Liverpool John Moores University, . was then faced with the heart breaking choice - a baby or her education. \u2018I . was suddenly forced to rethink my future. I\u2019d always assumed I\u2019d be a . mother one day but I was told I needed to make a choice and there was no . time to lose. \u2018I sat . down with my partner Jack, who I\u2019d been going out with for two years, . and explained what the doctors had said.

During the pregnancy, Amy spent 13 weeks in hospital and suffered two major bleeds - she was twice told that Ava would not survive . \u2018I realised I did want a family one day, and I knew I loved Jack. I could see myself spending my life with him. Jack agreed to start trying, and I cried out in relief.\u2019 The teenager gave up university and then faced a traumatic eight months as her race for a baby began. She suffered three miscarriages, two of which happened at eight weeks, and one at 17 weeks. She recalled: \u2018I was starting to lose hope. I didn\u2019t have time to grieve for my unborn babies.

Ms McStein, who has become a full-time mother, is currently preparing for her hysterectomy which will be carried out in the next 12 months, and spends her free time raising awareness for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common condition in which small pieces of the womb lining are found outside the womb - they can be found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder or bowel. The condition affects about two million women in the UK and most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. It is a chronic condition that causes painful and heavy periods. It can also lead to a lack of energy and fertility problems as well as pain during sex and bleeding between periods. Endometriosis symptoms can often be managed with painkillers or hormone treatments but surgery is sometimes required. Pregnancy can reduce the symptoms but they often return once the menstrual cycle returns to normal. One of the main complications of endometriosis is infertility. In severe cases, a hysterectomy can be required to treat the condition. However,the condition can return even after the operation. To have the best chance of curing the condition, the ovaries need to be removed as well."}]}

A lot has changed since then. Some 20-plus years later, I still love J.Crew, just...differently.\" I never realized. But, then again, J.Crew isn't alone when it comes to schooling older ladies on what they should or shouldn't bare. Oprah.com, way back in 2010, helpfully pointed out \"women of a certain age\" should NEVER wear mini-skirts with Uggs, never expose their stomach, never, never wear tube tops, absolutely no shredded denim and, for goodness sakes, no neon nail polish because \"as you age, skin gets more sallow.\" Thanks Adam Glassman! Guess I'll cross Uggs off the list! I am still a tad confused, though, by a People magazine spread a few months back that featured \"sexy grandmas!\" (yes, there was an exclamation point!) It featured a 68-year-old Goldie Hawn exposing her cleavage. Does that mean I can expose my grandchildren to my two best friends, but not my thighs? Perhaps this trend started with the best of intentions.

And while I'm at it, I'm done with the \"she looks great -- and holy sh--, she's 45!\" Jennifer Lopez is 45, but she looked beautiful at the Oscars Sunday night ... period. No age qualifier necessary. And, guess what? Her gown, with the deep, plunging neckline was awesomely appropriate even if it would never be included in the \"beyond\" category. Recently I had a conversation with a young male friend who was lambasting a \"nearly 60-year-old\" Madonna for exposing her bare rear end at the Grammys. \"Don't worry,\" I said. \"That wasn't for you.\" Madonna was simply doing what she's always done -- sending a message to women that it's okay to express your sexuality. I don't think I convinced him. But, that's okay. I have my own opinions. And that includes looking in the mirror and thinking, damn, I look great in these short shorts."}]}

When Moratti entered the VIP area of Milan\u2019s Hollywood nightclub, and came across eternal bachelor Irvine talking to the girl he had recently broken up with, he attacked him, punching him three times, a lawyer for Irvine told the court. The Formula One champion, who now runs a property company and a shipping business, claimed he was hit repeatedly from behind by Mr Moratti causing him to black out. Giving evidence at an earlier hearing, the multi-millionaire racing driver said he believed Moratti \u2018was jealous because I sometimes took his ex girlfriend out. He told the court: \u2018I had arrived at the club at about midnight and sat at a table in the VIP area. I was drinking a vodka lemonade and while I was sitting on the sofa talking to Giorgia I was struck with two or three punches by Moratti. I lost my balance and I fell. Someone tried to stop Moratti. I didn\u2019t look back because I was afraid he would hit me in the face.\u2019 Following the brawl, Irvine received . threatening phone calls from one of Moratti\u2019s associates in his Milan . hotel room, he told the court. He said he was left with damage to his ear which prevented him from diving which he had always done easily before the fight.

History: Irvine, left, celebrating with Ferrari engineer Jean Todot, center, and Michael Schumacher, right, after the Argentine Grand Prix in 1998 . After the brawl, both men pressed charges against each other for 'assault and battery'. Moratti denied starting the fight and claimed that Irvine was drunk. Irvine was not in court for the sentence but his lawyer confirmed that the racing star plans to lodge an appeal. Moratti . was present in court. After the sentence, judge Marco Formentin asked . the public prosecutor to investigate possible perjury and intimidation . by all the witnesses for the Moratti defence team,. which included a waiter and . his bodyguard.

The unexpected addition by the judge led Irvine\u2019s lawyer Marco Baroncini to declare the outcome \u2018a partial victory\u2019 for Irvine. For Moratti it was not his first brush with the law. In April of last year, he was fined \u20ac49,000 after falling foul of planning regulations, when he converted a warehouse in the Milanese suburbs into his personal Batman cave. Irvine, nicknamed Fast Eddie, was arrested in London in 2006 for speeding on a scooter in Hyde Park, without a licence or insurance. The jet set sportsman was a Formula One driver from 1993 to 2001, driving for the Jordan, Ferrari and Jaguar teams. The Northern Irish father-of-one, who has a home in Milan as well as properties in Dublin,\u00a0 Miami and New York, has said that driving for Italian team Ferrari was \u2018the best thing that ever happened to him.\u2019 After his stint at the team he is regarded as a national hero in Italy and says he is set up with free Italian food for life. No restaurant will allow him to pay a bill. Irvine, revealed: 'I still find it astonishing how the Italians react to anyone who has ever driven for Ferrari. 'The moment you sign a deal with the team you aren't just another driver, you become part-Italian \u2014 no matter what your nationality. You are given the keys to the country.' The Irish driver has an estimated fortune of 90million Euros, though at one time it was said to be as much as Euro200million.

The trip includes several fundraisers for his re-election bid. During a wide-ranging interview, Obama criticized Washington's harsh political climate, telling Leno that \"the things that folks across the country are most fed up with, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, (or) independent, is putting party ahead of country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation.\" The two men discussed several foreign policy topics, including the situation in Libya and the impending withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Regarding Libya, Leno asked the president for his reaction to the death of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi. \"This is somebody who for 40 years has terrorized his country and supported terrorism,\" Obama said. Gadhafi \"had an opportunity during the Arab Spring to finally let loose of his grip on power and to peacefully transition into democracy. We gave him ample opportunity, and he wouldn't do it.\" Obama said Gadhafi's demise sent \"a strong message around the world to dictators\" that \"people long to be free,\" and that \"universal rights\" and aspirations should be respected. The bloodied Gadhafi's televised jostling with his captors was not something Americans \"should relish,\" the president said . \"There was a reason after (Osama) bin Laden was killed, for example, we didn't release the photograph,\" the president said. \"I think that there's a certain decorum with which you treat the dead -- even if it's somebody who has done terrible things.\" The president hit back at GOP critics of the American role in the NATO-led Libya campaign, insisting that the United States did not, as many have claimed, \"lead from behind.\" \"We lead from the front,\" Obama asserted, highlighting the U.S. role in pushing a U.N. resolution backing NATO's intervention, as well as the U.S. military's role in establishing a no-fly zone over Libya. \"The difference here is we were able to organize the international community,\" Obama said. \"There was never this sense that somehow we were unilaterally making a decision to take out somebody. Rather, it was the world community.\" The Libya operation \"is a recipe for success in the future,\" the president declared. Obama also defended his choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year -- a decision blasted by GOP critics concerned the move will imperil U.S. gains in the region. \"I don't know exactly how they are thinking about it,\" Obama said. \"We've been in there for years, over 4,000 young men and women killed, tens of thousands injured, some of them for life, (and) spent close to $1 trillion on this operation. I think the vast majority of the American people feel as if it is time to bring this war to a close, particularly because we still have ... work to do in Afghanistan.\" The president noted the importance of the recent death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike. Al-Awlaki played a critical role with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, heading up external operations and focusing on attacking the United States, officials said. Al-Awlaki was \"probably the most important al Qaeda threat that was out there after bin Laden was taken out,\" Obama said. \"It was important that working with the enemies, we were able to remove him from the field.\" Turning closer to home, Obama had strong praise for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- his toughest competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. \"I'm really proud of her,\" Obama said. \"It really wasn't that difficult\" to come together after the campaign. \"The truth is Hillary and I agree on the vast majority of issues.\" Obama appeared to dismiss rumors of a possible job swap between Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden in 2012, telling Leno that \"they are doing great where they are.\" The president expressed a degree of sympathy for the Occupy Wall Street movement, noting that \"people are frustrated, and that frustration has expressed itself in a lot of different ways\" -- including both Occupy Wall Street and the tea party. As a huge basketball fan, the president called the current NBA lockout \"heartbreaking.\" \"We should be able to figure out how to split a $9 billion dollar pot so that our fans, who are allowing us to make all of this money, can actually have a good season,\" he said. Asked about his health and personal habits, Obama told Leno that he has \"definitively\" quit smoking, and remains \"big on exercise.\" The president said he works out on a regular basis with first lady Michelle Obama in a small White House gym. \"It's embarrassing sometimes,\" the president said. \"She'll get up there a half an hour earlier than me. She will have already run 10 miles or something ... (when I'm) staggering up to the gym.\" Noting the first lady's highly publicized campaign for fitness and healthier eating habits, Obama said his wife actually does enjoy more unhealthy cuisine on occasion. \"She loves french fries. She loves pizza. She loves chicken. Her point is just in moderation,\" Obama told Leno. As for the upcoming Halloween holiday, the president said his wife generally hands out fruit and raisins. The president said he told his wife that \"the White House is going to get egged if this keeps up.\""}]}

A robin had its feathers ripped out and was left for dead after being cruelly caught in a superglue trap. The little red bellied bird had attempted to wriggle free from the glue board, used to capture rats and rodents but had only succeeded in pulling lumps of its plumage out. Two boys discovered the robin chirping in distress and it was rescued by RSPCA officers. Stuck: Two boys discovered this robin chirping in distress after getting caught in a deadly superglue trap . The wildlife charity today called for a ban on the glue traps in which extra-strong adhesive is spread onto boards to catch vermin. It was designed not to dry or lose its stickiness so catches any animal which comes along and can cause them a slow, lingering death, an RSPCA spokesman said. The bird was found struggling by the side of Park Road in Hornsey, London, by the 12-year-old schoolboys. Inspector Natalie Bartle said: 'This poor little robin was a pitiful sight when I first arrived - very distressed and sticky all over. Without the caring attitude and diligence of these two young boys who knows how much longer it would have suffered? Injured: A grass snake died in a similar trap in Fore Street in Pinner, Middlesex, after its scales were damaged . 'It just shows how cruel and indiscriminate these traps can be. They catch any animal which happens along and this robin was lucky - usually those caught die a long and drawn out death.' Despite the loss of tail feathers, the robin survived and was taken to a wildlife centre where it was later released back to the wild. A grass snake died in a similar trap in Fore Street in Pinner, Middlesex, after its scales were irrevocably damaged. The RSPCA spokesman added it was an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act to set these glue boards in a place where wild birds could be caught. However, it is legal to use them to catch rats and mice but anyone doing so was required to take precautions to avoid death or injury to wild birds or other protected animals."}]}

Her parents, Andrew and Chelsea, noticed the boil in the evening, as they prepared their daughter for bed. \"We had already been through this three other times, so we weren't too worried,\" explains Chelsea, who says she had taken her daughter to a pediatrician on several occasions to treat skin infections. As they usually did when a little red circle with a white head appeared on their toddler's body, they popped it like a pimple and cleaned the area with antibacterial soap. But this time, that small pimple would turn into a major problem. \"By the next morning, it wasn't just a bump anymore. Her leg was red and extremely swollen, and she could hardly walk. She was in pain, and her fever had spiked to 103,\" her mother recalls. \"It went from minor to really, really bad overnight.\" By 10:30 that morning, they had rushed Audriana to their pediatrician in Oroville, California. She was hospitalized, and the Willmans learned their daughter had developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, which is a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments. This type of infection has been a problem in hospital settings for many years, but starting around 2000, it began steadily making its way into the lives of otherwise healthy people, especially children, who are not typically at risk for the fast-moving bacteria. As children head back to school, epidemiologists are encouraging parents to be more aware of the drug-resistant strain of staph and how to protect their kids. MRSA infections on the rise . \"Everyone is at risk,\" said Dr. Patrick Romano, senior author of a new report that found the number of children hospitalized with MRSA infections, mostly acquired from within the community, has more than doubled since 2000. \"MRSA really started as a bacterium that was seen in hospitals among high-risk patients. But during the last decade, we saw it spread to the general population.\" \"The problem is that MRSA began to affect people who were perfectly healthy,\" adds Dr. Jaime Fergie, author of a 2005 study that concluded that infections in children had reached \"epidemic proportions.\" Mutations in the organism made it more virulent and easy to transmit, he says. \"We continue to see more severe, life-threatening infections affecting the blood, lungs, muscles and even bones of previously healthy children.\" In 2009, 71,900 children were hospitalized because of infections under the skin, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the CDC estimates there are approximately 10,800 deaths in the U.S. each year caused by staph, of which 5,500 are inked to MRSA. The problem became so widespread that in January, the Infectious Diseases Society of America called the condition a \"huge public health problem\" and published its first-ever guidelines for the treatment of MRSA in pediatric patients. Protecting your child from MRSA . \"We have to live with the fact that it's out there, all around us in the community. At this point, we expect a certain level of these infections,\" Romano says. \"Now, it's a matter of recognizing the early signs and treating it early when we see it.\" Audriana Willman spent three days in a hospital and recovered without serious complication from her MRSA infection. Her parents say their previous experience has made them more cognizant of every little bump on their daughter. And because their daughter is prone to skin infections, they are even more vigilant about hygiene in their household. \"We learned that the hard way, how quickly they can progress. The longer we can go without them, the better,\" her mother says. As children head back to school, pediatricians are encouraging parents to become educated about MRSA to ensure that if their child gets an infection, they catch it early, before symptoms become severe. Here are 5 things parents should know: . 1. The infection site can resemble a spider bite . \"Sometimes, parents mistake [a MRSA infection] for a spider bite because it is so intense and appears so suddenly,\" said Fergie, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. \"If you haven't seen a spider, don't assume it's a spider bite. If you recognize a painful red spot with a little bit of pus, that's enough of a concern to go to a doctor,\" he recommends. To help you identify the infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has compiled several images to better visualize what MRSA infections may look like. 2. The infection may start like a pimple and advance rapidly . Dr. Jennifer Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician, says parents often don't realize how quickly the infection can progress. \"This is what shocks parents the most. Something that looked like a pimple is all of a sudden the size of a nickel,\" explains Shu, who says the bacteria can spread within a matter of hours. She once saw a patient who developed more than 30 skin boils in two to three days. 3. Transmission among young athletes is prevalent . According to the National Athletic Trainers' Association, skin diseases accounted for 56% of all infectious diseases in competitive sports from 1922 through 2005. Athletes tend to share things like equipment and towels, and children engaged in high-contacts sports inevitably receive cuts, bruises and scrapes, which act as potential entryways for serious bacterial infections. Last year, the association issued a position statement on skin disease among athletes warning that after a bacterial infection, they should not be allowed to return to a game until they complete a 72-hour course of antibiotic therapy and the infection has been completely drained. The CDC offers more prevention information and advice specifically for athletes on its website. 4. Treatment for MRSA not always the first option . Romano, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Davis, says that when a child has an infection, doctors do not always start with a prescription that works against MRSA bacteria. In communities experiencing high MRSA rates, pediatricians may automatically default to medications that fight the bacteria, but they may choose not to in communities where there hasn't been an outbreak. If someone in your home or another child in your child's school recently had a MRSA infection, alert a doctor, as it may be worth asking up front for a broader-spectrum antibiotic. Pages 12-15 of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Clinical Practice Guidelines list the treatment recommendations for adults and children based on their symptoms. Return to the pediatrician as soon as possible if within 48 hours you do not notice less swelling or redness, or if the infected area remains warm, Romano advises. 5. Bleach baths and proper cleaning can help prevent spread . If you have several children, and one of them has developed a MRSA infection, you want to keep the spread to a minimum. Experts say to keep the infected area covered with a bandage until it heals. The Willmans took the recommendation of an infectious disease specialist and gave their daughter a bleach bath using about a half-cup of bleach in about 13 gallons of water, a few times a week. There is the potential for skin irritation if the mixture is not diluted properly, so be sure to follow the guidelines outlined by the ISDA. You'll also want to clean surfaces that might come in contact with the infection. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a list of registered cleaning products that are effective against MRSA."}]}

Carver was handed the reins at St James' Park until the end of the season on Monday, starting with Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Hull. Eleventh-placed Newcastle have lost their last three games and failed to win in four as the 50-year-old former assistant manager seeks his first victory at the helm since succeeding Alan Pardew earlier this month. Newly-appointed Newcastle boss John Carver is determined to not let his side's season 'drift away' 'I'm delighted to have got the job until the end of the season,' Carver told nufc.co.uk. 'Everyone knows I love this club and my goals are simple - to finish as high as we can in the Premier League and get as many points as we can. 'Everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but I am not going to allow that to happen. Carver will be hoping he can pick up his first win at the helm when his side travel to Hull City on Saturday . 'Those who are saying that don't know me, don't know the people around me and don't know this group of players. 'We're much more professional than that. We can't afford to let the season drift away and I won't allow it to happen. 'I'm too demanding and I won't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of May.' Carver (left) and Peter Beardsley (right) with Callum Roberts (centre) after he signed his professional contract . Carver will work alongside Steve Stone and Dave Watson, the latter having stepped up from looking after the Magpies' Under-18 side, and says he plans to spend as much time on the training ground as he did when he was Pardew's assistant. 'I love being on the training pitch and the role of the head coach is to be hands-on out here,' Carver said. 'When you are a manager you have to manage the football club, but the role has changed and it gives me maximum time on the training ground, coaching the players. Alan Pardew (right) left the North-East club in December to become the new Crystal Palace manager . 'What I have done is given Steve (Stone) and Dave (Watson) more responsibility because they are very good at what they do, and it is important that you delegate to those who are talented. 'But when it comes to the meat of the session, it is my responsibility to prepare the team for the final 16 games. 'The players have been really positive and have responded. 'Even though we haven't won a game yet, I think we've played some nice stuff in spells. 'Ultimately though, it is about scoring goals and winning games so that needs to change. Top scorer Papiss Cisse could return for Newcastle after Senegal went out of the Africa Cup of Nations . 'We've done plenty of work on that on the training pitch and hopefully that little bit of luck we need will fall our way this weekend.' Carver's hopes of a first victory in charge could be boosted by the return of top scorer Papiss Cisse following Senegal's early exit from the Africa Nations Cup on Tuesday. Senegal's 2-0 defeat to Algeria saw them crash out at the group stage and nine-goal Cisse, who scored twice in a 2-2 home draw with Hull in September, could now be available for the trip to the KC Stadium. Hull City boss Steve Bruce, who was linked with the Newcastle job, will want to stop Carver getting his first win ."}]}

Last night, the pair landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state about midnight ET (9pm local time). Scroll down for video . Ecstatic: Kenneth Bae's mother ran over to her son at a Washington air base on Saturday two years after he was captured in North Korea and sentenced to 15 years behind bars for\u00a0alleged anti-government activities . Emotional embrace: Matthew Miller, 24, beamed as his mother rushed over to the plane to hug him . Bae, who was jailed in 2012 for alleged anti-government activities, was the first to step off the plane emblazoned with stars and stripes and onto the tarmac into the arms of his family members. The Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, laughed and beamed as he hugged his mother who ran over to him. He was followed by California-born Miller, 24, who\u00a0was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. With a shaved head, Miller looked happy but subdued as he walked down the steps and into his beaming mother's arms. His father wrapped an arm over his shoulder and took one of Miller's two small bags to carry. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation. While Miller went home with his family, Bae and his sister Terri Chung address a press conference. Freed: Bae was freed along with Miller after a lengthy intelligence operation by the top US official . Family: He was joined by his children, sister and brother-in-law based in Washington . 'I've grown': Bae told reporters he has learned a lot in his two years of hard labor at his private prison . Bae's family have thanked President Obama for not abandoning their relative . Bae thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him, and said 'it's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot.' He started his speech by saying: 'I just want to say thank you all for supporiting me and standing by me in this time and it's been just [an] amazing blessing to see so many people being involved getting me released in the last two years - not to mention the thousands of people praying for me. 'I just want to thank you for lifting me up and not forgetting me, not forgetting the people of North Korea as well.' 'This has been a tremendously difficult time for my family. 'I just want to thank President Obama and the state departments working tirelessly to bring me home, and North Korea. 'It's been an amazing two years. I learned a lot, I grew a lot lost, a lot of weight - in a good way - and I'm standing strong.'

Miller (right) was detained after allegedly ripping his tourist visa . Obama tabled the mission last week and it was approved by Congress, which sent intelligence official James Clapper to North Korea with a presidential letter. Bae and Miller were the last US nationals held by the dictatorship following the release last month of Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio resident detained for nearly six months. Bae's delighted son, Jonathan, told Reuters from Arizona that he received a call Friday night and spoke to his father. 'The brief time on the phone, he sounded good,' Jonathan said. 'I'm sure he will be back to his old self in no time. 'It came out of the blue. One minute he was doing farm labor and the next minute they are saying, 'You are going home.'

It is of particular interest to compare the Danish, Norwegian and Dutch experiences, because the three countries shared many similarities before the war and because the Nazi leadership saw them through the same prism. Despite this, the fate of the Jews in the three countries was very different. The armed resistance of Norway and the Netherlands led the Nazis to take control not only of their territories but of their entire societies. High-ranking German officials were sent to oversee the administration of Norway and the Netherlands, and local Nazis were installed in powerful positions throughout their civil administration. In sharp contrast, elected Danish politicians remained in control until the end of August 1943 and no Danish Nazis were allowed to be part of the Danish administration. This made it possible for the Danish authorities to reject the rationale for any measure to be taken against the Danish Jews. Indeed, the Danish government insisted that no Jewish problem existed in Denmark and that therefore no solution was called for. This attitude provoked a surprising reaction on the part of the Nazi leadership which not only hesitated and postponed the measures that were put in place elsewhere, but also softened the blow when finally, on October 1, 1943, the raid against the Danish Jews was executed. The Germans anticipated the popular Danish reaction in defense of their countrymen and sought to downplay the raid in order not to stir up too much trouble in the occupied country. The Danish opposition to the action caused the Nazis to hesitate and at the same time stimulated a consideration in Berlin of whether the action against the Danish Jews was worth the price? The continuation of \"Model-Protectorate Denmark\" with provisions of foodstuffs to Germany proved to be more important to the Nazi leaders than deporting and killing the Danish Jews. It is hard to conclude that something similar could have been achieved elsewhere under different conditions. But it is clear that the resistance of the Danes towards discrimination and persecution of their Jewish countrymen made it possible for the Danish Jews to escape. This unique story begs the question whether the same would be true today? Would Danes -- or for that matter any other people -- in a comparable situation rise up and act spontaneously to rescue their countrymen, even at the risk of their own safety? The question goes to the heart of one of the most intense discussions of modern democracies: who are \"we\" and who belongs to our society? What does it take to be British -- or Danish, or for that matter German? And who, living in Britain or in Denmark, are not seen as part of the national \"us\"? These questions find no easy answers. And yet, the history of the escape of the Danish Jews shows to us the critical importance of the answers. We have no reason to believe that Danes or other Europeans would not today act on their own initiative to help their countrymen at peril. But it may be less obvious who would in that case be considered countrymen. Whom do we see as part of society and thus under the protection of the communality? And whom do we see as strangers living among us? In the case of Denmark in the 1940s, the inclusion not only related to the well-established Jewish families who had been part of Danish society for centuries. It also included the more recently arrived \"Russian Jews\" who were first generation immigrants, and, perhaps more surprisingly, the not insignificant number of stateless Jews, mostly German refugees on the run from Nazi persecution. This group did not belong to Danish society in any trivial sense and they did not speak Danish. Most of them had been in the country only shortly, and many had no, if any, personal relation to Denmark. Yet, they were rescued, because most Danes at the time saw the Nazi assault against them as a violation of the sense of justice on which their nation was built. Therefore, coming to their rescue was considered a national duty, an act of patriotism. The rationale was neither abstract nor sophisticated. It was a widely shared sense that an injustice was being committed and that letting it pass without attempting to stop it would eventually corrupt the entire society. This sense is what society is about, today just as much as at the time of the escape of the Danish Jews. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bo Lidegaard."}]}

A study by financial experts Forbes found that Real Madrid's value now stands at $3.3 billion, knocking the English Premier League champions elect off the top of the list for the first time since the study began in 2004. Confounding the increasingly difficult economic conditions in Spain, Real, managed by Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, have increased revenues to $650 million. Their operating income of $134 million is second only to the $227 million amassed by the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, which is the highest of all sports teams. Manchester United, on the brink of securing a record 20th English top flight title, increased their value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes. Despite dropping to second behind Real, United have boosted revenues with a share issue and by signing bumper sponsorship deals. Their seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with U.S. car giant Chevrolet is worth $559 million while an eight-year agreement with insurance firm Aon is thought to be worth $230 million. All England's top flight clubs have been boosted by an increase in television revenue with the combined domestic and overseas rights having the potential to top $6 billion, Forbes say. Real's arch rivals Barcelona are third on the list with a value of $2.6 billion, English club Arsenal lie fourth on $1.32 billion while German champions Bayern Munich sit fifth on $1.3 billion. The top 20 clubs, all but one of which are European, are worth an average of $968 million, which is up 26% on last year. David Beckham, who now plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain, is again the best-paid soccer star with earnings of $50.6 million while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is second on $43.5m. Barcelona's Lionel Messi is third on $40.3m. Forbes say they value teams by calculating their \"enterprise values (equity plus debt) that are based on multiples of revenue that teams garner from television, premium seating, media, licensing, merchandise and concessions.\" But speaking to CNN, sports business expert Simon Chadwick questioned the relevance of measuring value in this way. \"Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona are all in the top-10 list of the most indebted clubs in the world, even if their revenue streams are healthy and strongly established,\" he said. \"The implication of measuring value in this way seems to be that many clubs in the top-10 are simply buying their success by signing players, building debt and winning trophies. \"It will be interesting to see the extent to which the UEFA Financial Fair Play initiative moderates valuations in coming Forbes league tables.\" UEFA's new rules are designed to make Europe's clubs live within their means and attempt to break even each year, though there is an allowance for debt in the initial stages of their strategy. Chadwick believes the figures underline just how immune soccer is to the financial difficulties being experienced in Europe. He says the upward spiral shows no signs of abating. \"While football clubs clearly have tremendous financial value and commercial potential, some of the figures being reported here are staggering,\" he added. \"For Real Madrid to almost double its financial value in 12 months is incredible, especially set against the backdrop of economic austerity (particularly in Spain) and competition from other sports and industrial sectors. \"If these figures are a truly accurate and rigorous measure of value, then they are stunning. Even at the top-end of the game, clubs are relatively underdeveloped as commercial entities. \"With changes in management practice, a stronger commercial emphasis, and global marketplace development, then one can only speculate how much further the value of top clubs might increase.\""}]}

A week after a cease-fire halted the war, families in Gaza have been returning to their homes shelled by Israel during Operation Protective Edge. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday. The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.

Palestinians gather around a fire amid the rubble of their destroyed house in the Gaza Strip. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday . Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war. A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt. The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates. Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed. Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south. The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks. The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week. Ziad Thabet, a Gaza Education Ministry official, said classes in the strip are set to begin on September 14. The U.N. said most of the displaced were to be evacuated to temporary housing by yesterday afternoon, but Thabet said the schools need to undergo repairs before they can be used. At least 223 Gaza schools, either run by the U.N. refugee agency or the Hamas government, were hit in the fighting, including 25 that are too damaged for use.

Meanwhile, Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation Of Palestine took part in a rally on Monday, a week after the beginning of the Egypt-mediated ceasefire. An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and headed by leading Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, indicated that 61 per cent of Palestinians would choose the Islamic militant group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for president if Palestinian presidential elections were held today. Only 32 per cent would vote for current President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas' rival, the survey suggested.

An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. Pictured is a masked Palestinian militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The support for Haniyeh marks a stark increase from a poll in June, conducted by the same pollster, which found only 41 per cent of Palestinians backed the Hamas figure. At the time, Abbas had 53 percent support. The poll also suggests a majority of Palestinians - 72 per cent - support adopting Hamas' armed approach in the West Bank. The research center said it is the first time in eight years that a majority of Palestinians has voiced such support for the Hamas leader. But, it said, Hamas' popularity might fall in coming months, as it did following previous Israel-Hamas conflicts. Polling started on the last day of the war, on August 26, and continued during the first four days of the ceasefire, the research center said. The poll said 79 per cent of respondents believe Hamas won the war, and 86 per cent support the renewal of rocket fire on Israel if a blockade on Gaza is not lifted, one of Hamas' main demands. Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) take part in a military show in Gaza City on Tuesday . Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza. Pictured are Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) But 25 per cent said armed groups in the Gaza Strip should give up their weapons after the blockade ends and elections are held. Also today, Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza. The expropriation of about 1,000 acres of West Bank land could help clear the way for new Jewish settlement construction. Lapid said such moves create 'redundant arguments with the United States and the world' and criticized the timing of the announcement following the Gaza war. Israel's Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, also criticized the move this week. Other leading Israeli Cabinet ministers have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct in the recently concluded war, with many saying he did not go far enough to neutralize Hamas's fighting ability.

Netanyahu has spoken vaguely about a new 'diplomatic horizon' that has emerged following the 50-day Israel-Hamas war. He has given few details on what he means. But Netanyahu has said that he is not willing to renew peace talks with Abbas, saying the Palestinian leader will have to first distance himself from Hamas militants. Hamas and Abbas' Palestinian Authority recently agreed to a unity deal that saw the formation of a government backed by both factions. 'He has to choose,' Netanyahu told Israeli Channel Two in a weekend interview. 'It's either yes to Hamas or no to Hamas.' Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting. The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh. In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the 'Pashosh' kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival. 'We are a little scared but we are excited,' said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school. 'A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.' In Gaza, Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.

Tiger Woods' former mistress has revealed that after her fianc\u00e9 died on 9/11 that she married a man who she would not mind if he died. The revelation comes after she said that her fianc\u00e9 who was working in the World Trade Center when the planes hit was 'meant to die'. As the nation prepares to mark the tenth anniversary of the terror atrocity, Rachel Uchitel, told the New York Post's Page Six magazine that dying on September 11 was part of Andy O'Grady's destiny.

Miss Uchitel, 36, became the face of the nation's grief after she was pictured sobbing while clutching a photo of her missing fianc\u00e9. But in 2009, her face was splashed across the American media for a different reason, as she was revealed to be one of the women associated with Tiger Woods' cheating scandal. Now in an extensive interview with the Post marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Miss Uchitel has revealed how she thinks she would make a good Ground Zero TV correspondent. She also spoke for the first time about her middle school friendship with Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss her made headlines as the 17-year-old dating Jerry Seinfeld. On the morning of the attacks Miss Uchitel said she refused to kiss her fianc\u00e9 because she had just put lipstick on. She said: 'I believe Andy was meant to die because he was too good,' she said. 'I'm almost happy it ended the way it did because I've learned so many lessons from him. Sex scandal: In 2009, Uchitel gained notoriety as one of the women in the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal . 'It would have been tragic if we got into fights and then divorced.

Born on April 5, 1899, Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world. She died peacefully on March 21 and her family held a memorial service in Clearwater. Her ashes will be buried in Pennsylvania, next to her late husband. Thompson's only child George Thompson, 72, said she died as he flew from his home in California to see her. She had congestive heart failure. Aged nicely: Thompson, pictured with a friend in 1999, enjoyed dancing and singing until the end . 'She had such a big heart,' he told\u00a0The Tampa Bay Times on Sunday. 'She was such a large person.' Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, who was born on May 23, 1899. As well as being the oldest person in the US, Talley, from Inkster, Michigan, is the oldest living black person and credits 'the Lord' as her secret to a long life. Thompson was born during the administration of President William McKinley and just a year after the close of the Spanish-American War. She was a stylish dresser who enjoyed ballroom dancing until shortly before her death. She also loved to sing and play the piano, the Times reported. Susie Harper, 59, Thompson's caregiver of 13 years, said she never saw the elderly woman in a bad mood. Long life: On the brink of her 114th birthday, Elsie Calvert Thompson, pictured, died peacefully in her Florida apartment . Secret: At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity: 'I love people,' she said . In fact, Harper said the 113-year-old . told the Times she glided from bed every morning with a smile and was a . 'tireless hostess' who always offered guests food and drink despite . being well over a century old. 'She would wake up and say, \"Oh my, . won't you look outside? Isn't it beautiful?\" And if it was raining, she . would say, \"That's okay, we'll make our own sunshine,\"' Harper said. Thompson . had been in the record books for her remarkable age for four years . before she won the distinguished title of being the oldest living . American. At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity. 'I love people,' she told the Times back then. She always loved entertaining and . welcoming to visitors, but she wasn't able to celebrate earning her new . title of America's oldest person in January as she had been advised to avoid outside contact . because of the flu epidemic. Record books: Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world . Big milestone: Elsie Thompson, pictured on her last birthday, was just weeks shy of turning 114 . Those steps are seen as wise by many, as two of the previous title-holders died as a result of infections last month. Both 116-year-old Besse Cooper and 115-year-old Dina Manfredini died in December. Reporters from The Tampa Bay Times . met with Thompson on her 111th, 112th, and 113th birthdays, but the flu . precautions kept them away when she earned her title recently. Thompson was known for having a zest for life that many did not expect of someone her age. 'You'll say, \"Elsie, honey, you wanna get up?\" And she'll say, \"You betcha.\" Sometimes she'll talk and talk,' Harper said of the woman in January. Harper had worked with Thompson for the past 13 years as she continued to live in her own condominium in Clearwater, Florida as opposed to an assisted living facility.

Thompson is one of the only 14 people left on Earth who were on the planet during the 19th century. Thompson stopped traveling to California to visit her son and his family son time before her death. He initially pushed for her to move to be nearer to him and his family when his father- her longtime husband- died in 1986, but she opted to stay in Florida. 'It has continued to work because she's well taken care of,' he told The Tampa Bay Times in January. 'It's a different world here, and she's so familiar with everything there. You should see how she gets around her apartment. She knows exactly where everything is.'"}]}

Scot Lawrie proved a last day hero after his 5&3 victory over Brandt Snedeker helped his team retain the trophy, but he did not enjoy being the butt of the American supporters. \"I didn't get abused, but you get 'top it, shank it, you're a loser', stuff like that, every shot you play,\" he said. It came as no surprise to the 43-year-old veteran, who played in the infamous \"Battle of Brookline\" in 1999 where raucous home support helped the Americans overturn a four-point deficit on the last day. This time the boot was on the other foot, as inspired by team captain Jose Maria Olazabal, the Europeans silenced the crowd and pulled off the same feat in the concluding singles. \"It makes it all the more satisfying on Sunday night when you're standing there with the Ryder Cup in front of you and they are not. I think it helps us, to be fair. \"I think they (the United States team) said it's the same when they come here. Apparently that's how it is, but I can't see that.\" Lawrie has returned to a heroes welcome on home soil where he will be playing in the Alfred Dunhill Links tournament this week. \"Since I arrived here I can hardly get a ball hit for people coming up kind of slapping you on the back. It's been lovely,\" he added. Germany's Martin Kaymer, who holed the testing final putt to make sure Europe retained the Ryder Cup as he beat Steve Stricker, is also in the field. Kaymer had rolled his initial birdie putt on the 18th at Medinah about six foot past the hole to leave the Europe supporters with their hearts in their mouth. \"Even though it was more difficult in the end, it was an even better feeling. Of course it was a lot of pressure, but I see it more like a gift what happened,\" he told the official European Tour website. \"There will never, ever, be a more important putt in my life. Even if I have a chance in two years' time again (At Gleneagles) I've done it before already,\" added the 27-year-old. Kaymer will be looking for his second win in three stagings of the tournament when play gets underway Thursday."}]}

Only this time here it was Rory McIlroy who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him. McIlroy who was drawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind. For Garcia and Rickie Fowler, it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in Hoylake all the more torturous. As Fowler dropped a shot on 17, his third bogey in four holes, McIlroy could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th. Under pressure: Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler during the third round on Saturday . As the American and the Spaniard then made their way across the third fairway to the scorer's tent, there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the Ulsterman. Fowler had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between first and second widening. Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day's first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group off. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there. It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who came through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an almost futile exercise however well those in\u00a0 the chasing pack might be playing. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you can do is say \"well done\".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32\u00a0 and then birdying 10, 11 and 12\u00a0 to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had taken into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, because he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating McIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not to\u00a0 mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel the force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The advice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun being around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him and\u00a0 seeing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with Butch\u00a0 Harmon \u2013 a coach Fowler described as the 'best in the world' \u2013 the young American has been\u00a0 itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too,\u00a0 sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if he will want to\u00a0 forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia thinks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to shoot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's difficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits him. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American Rickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having grown up competing against\u00a0 McIlroy.

Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses \u00a3400 a day for training courses on injecting the toxic drug at his Harley Street clinic. Showing a \u2018cavalier\u2019 attitude to safety, he told them to give Botox to patients without a prescription. Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses \u00a3400 a day for training courses on illegally injecting Botox. Pictured: Dr Harrison advertises his training in a video . He admitted the practice was \u2018naughty\u2019 but said regulation was so lax they would get away with it. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a \u00a34million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than \u00a31million from the scam. But Harrison, managing director of Harley Aesthetics, was exposed by an undercover BBC investigation in which a journalist posed as a trainee nurse to film him secretly. Yesterday he was condemned for his \u2018flippant, cavalier and deplorable\u2019 attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing. The Fitness To Practise panel found him guilty of misconduct by encouraging the nurses to break the law and suspended him for 12 months. Botox is normally administered by a doctor to a patient with a valid prescription after a face-to-face consultation. But Harrison found a loophole in the law at the time that allowed remote prescribing in exceptional circumstances, and he authorised nurses to perform the procedure by speaking to them on his mobile. He charged \u00a330 for each \u2018consultation\u2019 and offered one-day training courses at his practice for nurses who wanted to administer Botox. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a \u00a34million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than \u00a31million from the scam . The 2012 BBC investigation alleged Harrison told nurses to use Botox prescribed for one patient on another and actively encouraged them to not pay adequate regard to a patient\u2019s medical history before administering the jabs. The millionaire \u2013 who also owns a six-bedroom Gloucestershire mansion with a nearby private stable for his seven polo ponies and properties in the French Alps including a \u00a31million chalet and a hotel \u2013 boasted in his company newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions, suggesting he made \u00a31.5million from the phone calls alone. His company, one of the UK\u2019s largest purchasers of Botox, charged patients from \u00a3200 for a treatment. He was filmed telling nurses: \u2018Strictly speaking, a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No. It is not legal but it\u2019s what everybody does, doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name \u2013 it\u2019s not policed at all.\u2019 Harrison also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before giving Botox they should go ahead and he would authorise it afterwards. He was condemned for his \u2018flippant, cavalier and deplorable\u2019 attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing for carrying out the training courses at his Harley Street clinic (pictured) Suspending him following a hearing in Manchester, the panel said: \u2018The findings against Dr Harrison are wide-ranging, some are repeated and involve the potential to place patients at risk of harm. His conduct... could properly be described as deplorable.\u2019 In a letter to the panel, Dr Harrison said: \u2018I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable. 'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it. I do not encourage nurses to do that.\u2019 In the wake of the investigation into Harrison, the GMC has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation."}]}

Three men had to use their hands to desperately claw Abigail Thomas, 12, and Jodie Leach, nine, from the sand. The girls were digging a hole at the base of the cliff when up to 30 tonnes of sand started to slide away from the top. The pair tried to run away, but Jodie tripped and was buried up to her neck by the landslide at Hemsby beach, Norfolk. Jodie Leach, 9, and Abigail Thomas 12, back at their home in Haverhill, Suffolk after nearly being buried alive in sand . Abigail said: 'We ran away and Jodie fell over.

'We thought that more sand might come down and . kill us. The men had to dig under us to pull us out. It was really hurting us.' The girls\u2019 screams alerted a man and a woman who were walking on the beach and they rushed over to help. The two schoolgirls were buried in sand by a landslide at Hemsby near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk . The man and another passer-by frantically started digging the girls out with their hands as Abigail\u2019s sister Jessica, nine, watched in horror. A boy who was with the couple ran to fetch retired fisherman Kenny Chaney, 66, who was metal detecting around 150 yards away. Mr Chaney of Hemsby helped the two other men scoop the sand away as the woman dialled 999 to alert coastguards, firefighters and paramedics. The trio faced the possibility of being buried themselves if there was a second landslide, but they carried on digging and pulled the girls out in ten minutes. Jodie\u2019s brother Jake, 12, ran quarter of a mile so he could get help from his parents Chris, 40, and Natasha, 39, who were at the nearby Long Beach caravan park.

The girls who suffered only minor injuries were taken to the James Paget Hospital at Gorleston near Great Yarmouth. Jodie was given oxygen by paramedics as she had breathed in sand. Abigail had a suspected broken ankle, but an X-ray revealed she had only suffered a bad sprain. The drama happened just after 12.30pm on Good Friday when the girls and their families who are both from Kedington, Suffolk, were on the first day of an Easter break in their touring caravans. Jodie added: 'It was such a relief to get out. We want to thank the people who helped us.' Retired fisherman Kenny Chaney, 66, was on the beach when the life-and-death drama erupted ."}]}

Such is the clamor for tickets for Coventry City's return to the Ricoh Arena that one supporter was prepared to camp outside the box office on Wednesday night. The Sky Blues will return to the city when they face Gillingham this weekend after more than a year playing their games in Northampton. But the club's loyal follower - known simply as 'Andy' - was saved from a night in the cold when a fellow City fan arrived at the ground to offer his spare ticket after hearing the story on Twitter. Front of the queue: Andy prepares for a night outside the ticket office with a cup of tea . Good Samaritan: A fellow Sky Blues supporter arrived to give Andy his spare ticket . Heading home: Coventry are to return to the Ricoh Arena after playing in Northampton for more than a year . Remaining tickets have been limited to two per person to deal with the demand from excited supporters. Steve Waggott, chief executive of Coventry City Football Club, said: 'You can feel the positivity around the city about our return to the Ricoh and long may that continue. 'Everyone is looking forward to Friday night and what should be a great occasion for the club and the city.' The League One side have ended their dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), and have reached an agreement to head back to the stadium they played in between 2005 and 2013. Back to where they belong: A fan protests at the Ricoh in 2013, prior to Coventry's move . Home from home: Coventry take on Barnsley earlier this month at their adopted home in Northampton . The two-year deal, with an option for an extra two years, should see the Sky Blues play at the Ricoh in their next home fixture, which is against Gillingham on 6 September. The deal was struck after Coventry owners Sisu paid ACL \u00a3471,192 via the Football League last week, with the money going towards compensation and unpaid rent. ACL had previously said it would not discuss a return until it received money owed by the club after they went into administration last year. Sisu and ACL first came into conflict in April 2012 when Coventry started to withhold what they felt was unreasonable rent from the stadium operators. The Sky Blues then agreed a three-year groundshare deal with Northampton - 35 miles away - with an option of a further two years, and the Cobblers will be due compensation after the early end of the deal. A year's break: Coventry spent last season playing in front of small crowds at Northampton's   Sixfields Stadium . Versatile: The Ricoh Arena has been used for other events, such as football matches during the 2012 Olympics . 'We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with this news. 'We are under no illusion what a difficult 12 months it has been for the supporters and that was uppermost in our thinking as we worked to get this deal done. 'There has had to be compromise on both sides and the commercial details of the deal will remain confidential. 'Now it is all about looking forward to a really exciting season back in the community and with a real chance of success. I am sure every supporter will want to give Steven Pressley, his staff and players their full backing for the season at the Ricoh. 'Logistically, it's going to mean a huge amount of work between now and the first game back and we would ask supporters to bear with us as all of our efforts up to now have been in getting this deal over the line to get us back to Coventry as soon as possible. 'We will announce details around tickets, Season Tickets and other information as soon as we can next week but we hope to be back at the Ricoh for the clash with Gillingham.

Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide. House prices are now 2.4 per cent higher than before the 2008 economic crash - with the average home worth \u00a3188,446. Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide . Separate Land Registry figures said prices in England and Wales in the year to December rose 7 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November and the fourth month in a row that the annual rate has fallen. Both sets of figures show that average house prices have remained static since last summer. The Nationwide said the reasons for the slowdown in the housing market since then 'remain unclear', as the economic background has in fact continued to improve. But it predicted that house prices would take off again once people started to feel the benfit of pay rises. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the number of mortgages approved  had been about 20 per cent below last year - and surveyors continued to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries. But Mr Gardner said the reasons for the continued slowdown were unclear given the fall in unemployment, wages that have started to rise faster than inflation and high levels of consumer confidence which have helped fuel strong retail sales growth. 'If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead,' he said. Britain's five year house price boom has benefited Conservative supporting areas much more than Labour constituencies . Prices were also likely to be supported by the long-term shortage of new houses coming onto the market. 'It is encouraging that the number of new homes built in England was up 8 percent in the year to the third quarter of 2014. However, this is still 34 percent below pre-crisis levels and little over half the expected rate of household formation in the years ahead,' Gardner said. The Land Registry data showed that London house prices ended the year up by 16.3 per cent, at an average of \u00a3464,936. In nine boroughs prices were up by more than a fifth over the year, and in every part of the capital rises were in double digits. The biggest leap in prices was in the north-east borough of Waltham Forest, which includes Walthamstow, which saw prices increase by 25.1 per cent to an average of \u00a3368,000. Kensington & Chelsea recorded the lowest level of growth within London, at 11.5 per cent over the year, but the average price was still a lofty \u00a31.3million."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- The Australian Senate has rejected a bill that would have revived plans to process asylum seekers in offshore detention centers in a highly emotional vote following the sinking of two boats packed with people in one week. Senators voted down the legislation by 39 votes to 29, after hours of heated debate that saw one politician break down in tears as she described the plight of one 15-year-old boy's journey from Afghanistan. Soon after the vote, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that former defence force chief Angus Houston would lead \"an expert group\" to determine the best way forward on asylum seekers, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"I want to be very clear about the role of this expert group,\" Gillard said. \"This expert group will receive the facts from Government and beyond. They will be able at their option to receive briefings wherever they want to get those briefings from. They will be able to assemble all of the material to help them form their views. They will be able to consult as they see fit,\" the ABC reported. The dilemma of what to do with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt the risky trip by boat to Australia each year has long divided the nation's political parties, and its people. However, the sinking of two boats in the past week carrying more than 300 people lent the issue urgency ahead of parliament's long winter break. More than 200 people were pulled from the sea near Christmas Island, north of Australia, after the separate accidents. It's not clear how many died because authorities don't have an accurate count of how many people were on board the vessels. Two years ago, Mujtaba Ahmadi made a similar treacherous journey from Indonesia on a fishing boat packed with more than 70 other people seeking a new life in Australia. He was just 15 years old. \"We came direct from Jakarta to Christmas Island. There are a lot of ways, this is the short way but it's very dangerous,\" Ahmadi said. \"There were too many people on the boat. We didn't have any space to sleep. We didn't have enough life jackets.\" The teenager left Iran with his family's blessing; his father borrowed money from his friends and his mother and sister sold their jewelry to raise $11,000. Some was spent on flights, while half was paid to people smugglers for the 50-hour boat trip. \"I heard that there are a lot of human rights in Australia. That's why I decided to come to Australia,\" he said. \"But then I arrived in a detention center, I thought no, there are no human rights in Australia.\" Ahmadi spent two months in detention on Christmas Island before being transferred to a hotel in Darwin, the Asti Motel, which for a time was used as a temporary detention center. He stayed there for eight months before being granted a visa to stay. Now 18, Ahmadi is learning English in Sydney and is following the debate among the nation's politicians as best he can, though he still can't understand why he spent so long in detention. \"We didn't do anything wrong. We are not criminals,\" he said. If the bill -- the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 -- had been passed Thursday, it would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and the island of Nauru in the South Pacific for processing. It also would have marked a revival of Gillard's controversial \"Malaysia Solution,\" a deal agreed with the Malaysian government to send 800 asylum seekers there each year for processing in exchange for 4,000 refugees to Australia. The deal was ruled invalid last August by the High Court on the grounds that Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act. Despite fierce opposition from the coalition and the Greens Party, the House of Parliament narrowly passed the bill late Wednesday, clearing the way for the Senate vote. The Greens said they were pleased the government had announced a multi-party committee to look into the issue, but said more could have been done. \"The government could, today, have taken the pressure off these desperate people to get on boats by immediately resettling thousands of people waiting in Indonesia and Malaysia, properly resourcing the UNHCR and increasing search and rescue capability,\" Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said in a statement. The bill's defeat leaves the country without an effective response to attempts by asylum seekers to enter the country. The expert group has been asked to report back before parliament resumes in mid- August, the ABC said. The number of boats attempting the journey rose dramatically after Labor's Kevin Rudd defeated long-term Liberal leader John Howard in a federal election in 2007. During his time in power, Rudd unraveled Howard's policies, including the \"Pacific Solution,\" which involved diverting asylum seekers to detention camps on remote Pacific islands. The Howard policies were slammed by critics as inhumane, however supporters credited them with deterring large numbers of people from boarding boats to Australia. \"They were humane as they possibly could be in the circumstances,\" Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey told the ABC before Thursday's Senate vote. He said the coalition was pushing for a policy of turning back boats when possible, reopening the processing center on Nauru and granting asylum seekers temporary protection visas. The coalition would never support the Malaysia \"people swap,\" he added. Since replacing Rudd as Labor leader, Gillard has adopted a tougher stance on asylum seekers but has resisted calls from the opposition to return to the Howard policies."}]}

Despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation's Latino population, the House leadership has chosen to show it disrespect. How shameful. Here is some context: Last year, 409,849 human beings -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- were torn from their families and deported. Millions have been exploited, forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship. An entire generation of immigrants, the majority of whom are immigrants of color, are relegated to second-class status. Sadly, many of the same corporations that build the country's correctional facilities also build and run prison-like immigrant detention facilities. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform Act and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which cuts off long-standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented, and since 9/11, even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion. The breakdown of our democratic values does not end there. The path to equal representation in our democracy \u2014 our fundamental right to vote \u2014 must also be urgently addressed. On June 25, the Supreme Court struck down the formula of the Voting Rights Act needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination. Just two hours after the decision, Texas announced it would reinstate its strict voter ID law. This law had already been struck down by the Justice Department as discriminatory against Latinos and African Americans -- groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government-issued photo ID required under the law. Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls, ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud. Under the purge procedure, Florida's immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status, hearing dates, requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents. The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens, despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project, Latino Justice, other national voting rights groups, and Florida-based Latino and Haitian American community groups. In state after state across the country, voter ID and other \"show me your papers to vote\" laws, laws that disparately impact immigrants of color, are being pursued at an alarming rate. Given our nation's long history of racial discrimination, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically.  Restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black Americans first became \"citizens\" and eligible to vote. But disenfranchisement is not the American way. True democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens, and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn. For a true and just democracy, we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights. Only when each person, regardless of race or ethnicity, is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy -- and indeed, the American dream -- be realized."}]}

It was a historic walk that observers say was in line with his appetite for the extreme and the high-wire customs of his \"Flying Wallendas\" family. Pumping his fist in the air, Wallenda sprinted the last few steps on the wire. After touching down on Canadian soil, he embraced his family, grinning ear to ear. The tense 1,800-foot journey took 25 minutes, according to CNN affiliate CTV. \"I'm extremely blessed to be where I am,\" Wallenda said after stepping onto Canadian soil. Gotta watch: Tightrope stunts . To abide with immigration law, he had a U.S. passport tucked in a plastic bag in his pocket during the trip, according to the affiliate. Two border guards were waiting as soon as he stepped on Canadian soil to ensure he had the correct paperwork. \"It hasn't sunk in yet,\" he told ABC, which broadcast the event. \"This is something that I've played over and over in my mind for the last 20 years, and to finally be here at this point, it is very surreal. As I said as I left that wire, I'm extremely blessed to be where I am.\" Wallenda described the difficulties of dealing with the wind and heavy mist from the roaring falls. \"It's all about the concentration, the focus, and it all goes back to the training. You know, in the middle of the wire at one point, I just started thinking about great-grandfather and paying tribute to him and all the walks that he did,\" he said. His great-grandfather Karl Wallenda was killed at the age of 73, attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. When asked by ABC how he planned to top the walk over Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he hopes to become the first person in the world to walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. Thousands were on hand to watch Wallenda teeter his way on the 2-inch-wide wire over Horseshoe Falls toward Canada.

Wallenda, who hails from multiple generations of high-flying daredevils, had a near fall as he stumbled on a tightrope above Baltimore's Inner Harbor earlier this year. \"It's been a dream of mine for a long time,\" Wallenda told CNN before the Niagara Falls attempt. \"I'm one of those people who always tries to overachieve. I want to do more. I want to do bigger things.\" Other daredevils have tried their luck walking over Niagara, but farther downstream and not since 1896. More than 10 people have attempted to cross different parts of Niagara Falls, some in barrels, one on a bicycle and even one with a washing machine strapped to his back. Wallenda is the first person in recent history to cross over the actual falls, braving the thick mist and roaring waters, according to the affiliate.

The company is protesting Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported an anti-same-sex marriage campaign. Firefox is owned by Mozilla. When OkCupid members navigate to the site on a Firefox browser, they are met with a message encouraging them to use an alternative browser to access the site, including Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and the amusingly misspelled Internet Exploder. \"Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure,\" reads the message. The page points out that 8% of the matches made on OkCupid are between same-sex couples. Last week, Mozilla promoted Eich, a longtime employee who was previously the company's chief technology officer, to the position of CEO. The move prompted renewed outrage by third-party developers and employees. Eich donated $1,000 to support Propostion 8 in 2008. The California ballot initiative sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state. The donation was made public in 2012 but Eich held onto his job. After the announcement of Eich's promotion, app development company Rarebit announced it had pulled its apps from Firefox. \"As a married gay couple who are co-founders of this venture, we have chosen to boycott all Mozilla projects,\" said founder Hampton Catlin in an open letter to the company. Various Mozilla employees have also spoken up about the promotion, taking to Twitter to openly share their disappointment with Eich's politics. Some have come together and publicly called for Eich to step down. Eich posted a blog on his personal site last week addressing the backlash. He outlined his plan to support LGBT-friendly policies at Mozilla and expressed \"sorrow at having caused pain.\" \"I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone,\" he said. The apology hasn't satisfied everyone, and the backlash continues to grow one week later. OkCupid is one of the most high-profile companies to take a stand against Eich's appointment. The letter on the OkCupid home page is a bold move. However, it is not actually blocking Firefox users from using OkCupid. At the bottom of the page is a link to continue on to the site. \"Mozilla supports equality for all, including marriage equality for LGBT couples. No matter who you are or who you love, everyone deserves the same rights and to be treated equally,\" said a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement. \"OK cupid never reached out to us to let us know of their intentions, nor to confirm facts.\""}]}

The West African nation's long-awaited, much-delayed second round presidential runoff between Diallo and Alpha Conde is scheduled for Sunday. But more than a week of violence and intimidation that has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the towns of Siguiri, Kouroussa and Kissidougou in eastern Guinea has soured what would be the nation's most credible democratic presidential vote in its 52-year history. Are you there? Share images and video with CNN iReport . Ananie Kashironge, head of media relations for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Conakry, the nation's capital, told CNN on Tuesday that 2,800 people were displaced on October 29 and 30 alone. In addition, commercial trucks filled with ethnic Peul and all their possessions have been leaving the eastern towns of Siguiri (about 800 kilometers from Conakry) and Kouroussa (about 580 kilometers from Conakry) every day for the past 12 days, and local officials for Diallo's UFDG party say a total of 15,000 to 20,000 Peul have been displaced around the country. Most of the displaced people have traveled west to the Fouta Djallon region, where they have relatives, the officials say. After a rally for Conde in Conakry on October 22 in which dozens of supporters fell sick after drinking contaminated water and yogurt, ethnic Malinke people attacked Peul in Upper Guinea, especially in Siguiri and Kouroussa, for days. Those displaced spoke of Malinke men looting and burning Peul-owned businesses and demolishing homes where Peul lived in Siguiri. Officials for Diallo's party said they registered the deaths of three Peul in Siguiri, one who had been fatally beaten and two who had died after being struck by stones. Conde, whose father is from the Malinke ethnic group, draws much of his support from the majority Malinke region of Upper Guinea, where most of the violence happened. Diallo, an ethnic Peul, has his base of supporters in the northwestern Fouta Djallon region. Sabo Camara, the campaign director for the UFDG party in Dabola, a town on the border of the Fouta Djallon and Upper Guinea regions where many Peul have stayed or passed through, said the violence seemed planned. \"They don't want [the Peul] to vote and we heard that they even put out a communique on local radio saying that if [the Peul] stay there until election day they will kill all of them,\" Camara told CNN on Monday. \"We estimate that 15 to 20,000 people have passed through or stayed in Dabola\" since October 22,\" he added. \"Many told us that meetings had been organized, and razors and knives distributed to get rid of the Peul by force.\" One displaced man said those who forced them out made no secret of the reason. \"They told us, 'Come election day not a single Peul will vote here,' which is why they chased us away,\" said Thierno Barry, who left Siguiri with his family and all their belongings and was heading for his village of origin in the Fouta Djallon region. And a displaced Peul woman traveling from Siguiri who asked not to be named for safety reasons told a similar story. \"They gave out a list of people from the Peul ethnic group and said that they have to leave before the election or they will be killed,\" she said. Camara said the authorities in Siguiri and Kouroussa, members of a military junta who has ruled Guinea since December, 2008, did not do anything to stop the violence. \"We are under the impression that the authorities are complicit. Otherwise how can there be such trouble for four, five days without the authorities intervening,\" he said. Cheik Kaba, a Malinke businessman in Kankan, an upper Guinea city some 120 kilometers from Siguiri, told CNN that anti-Peul violence had spread to Kankan but had been contained because of local peace efforts. Conakry supporters of Conde's RPG party \"called us to say that [the Peul] poisoned RPG members. ... Everyone wanted to destroy everything here, but we reasoned with them and made them understand that it is our country and Guinea belongs to everyone, so they left them alone,\" Kaba said. Dr. Mohamed Saliou Camara, professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and author of a book on Guinea's independence leader, told CNN recently that \"ethnicity becomes truly a problem when politicians resort to it to compensate for their lack of viable ideological platform and political program to meaningfully mobilize the electorate.\" The number of displaced people has once again complicated efforts to hold a credible second round of presidential elections. Siaka Toumani Sangare, the retired Malian general in charge of Guinea's electoral commission, told journalists at a press conference on Monday that the government was taking measures to ensure that those displaced will be able to vote. But with thousands of displaced people now in remote villages with electoral cards left behind in Siguiri and Kouroussa, it will be very difficult for the inefficient Guinean government to reach all those affected. \"We are very scared because this is a dangerous precedent, a very dangerous precedent,\" Sabo Camara said. \"If people who have lived in a place for 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, are told to leave the houses they have built, the businesses filled with their goods, it's really quite worrying.\""}]}

To anyone under the age of 40, Paul Elliott is instantly recognisable as one half of the Chuckle Brothers, children\u2019s TV favourites from 1987 onwards. With Paul playing straight man to his hapless older brother Barry, the pair made\u00a0 an impressive 21 series of their hit BBC show Chucklevision, famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as \u2018to me, to you\u2019. They filmed their last series in 2009, making it the longest running sitcom after Last Of The Summer Wine. Regular at this pub: Chuckle Brother Paul Elliot in the bar at his home 'Half Acre' in Hatfield, Doncaster, South Yorkshire . With their success came all the trappings, and Paul\u2019s five-bedroom gated home, Half Acres \u2013 with its well-stocked bar room, snooker room and grounds of one-and-a-half acres \u2013 is testimony to this. Set in the pleasant village of Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Half Acres is a 15-minute drive from Doncaster and not far from Rotherham, where Paul and Barry grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents \u2013 mum Amy and father James, a gang show performer. However,\u00a0 you could say that Paul has become a victim of his own success. The palatial house, set down a private road, has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite reducing the asking price by \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3550,000, he has yet to find a buyer. \u2018We\u2019ve had only four or five viewings in all that time,\u2019 says Paul, who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers. \u2018The average house price around here is in the region of \u00a395,000; we\u2019re charging more than five times that.\u2019 Hard sell: Mr Elliot has been forced to lower the price for the home with \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer . In frustration, he has just changed estate agents. According to Julian Brown, director at Portfield, Garrard and Wright, Paul\u2019s new agents, it has been a tough few years for prices in the region. He explains that prices have yet to recover to pre-2008 levels but things are starting to look up. \u2018Last month was cracking, our best in four years,\u2019 he says, \u2018but there are few buyers in Paul\u2019s price range and because it\u2019s such a unique property, it has to find its own level.\u2019 Paul\u2019s material possessions have been hard won. This is the Chuckle Brothers\u2019 50th year as a double act \u2013 they found fame after winning the TV talent show New Faces in 1974 \u2013 and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run, in Darlington. Although both in their late 60s, the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team-building events, as well as touring with their own show. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine retiring because it\u2019s such good fun,\u2019 says Paul. Chuckling away: The five-bedroom home also has a snooker table and an en-suite master bedroom . He admits the panto season \u2013 two performances a day, six days a week until February \u2013 is pretty exhausting. \u2018It\u2019s not an easy life but it\u2019s better than going down the pit,\u2019 says Paul, whose first job was working in a Sheffield steelworks. Paul and wife Sue, 56, bought Half Acres for \u00a3300,000 in 2002 and have spent about \u00a350,000 extending it, adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room. Now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s, they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their Brittany farmhouse. Despite struggling to sell his current home, Paul still thinks property is a good place to invest his money. \u2018Obviously I\u2019m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price.\u2019 The couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to Half Acres. They built a five-bedroom villa with pool on the Greek island of Kefalonia, which they rent to holidaymakers, and own a two-bedroom apartment on the island, where they themselves holiday. They have also bought a two-bed apartment in Calabria, Italy, which they visit twice a year. portfieldgarrard.com ."}]}

It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one.\" Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. \"I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time,\" said Haslerud. \"I deserve it after all that we went through this week.\" The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. \"It was absolutely deplorable,\" passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and \"they started making mayo sandwiches.\" Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of \"a flameless fire.\" Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And \"I think we would wait a year,\" Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. \"It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. \"I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach,\" she said. The couple said they were unsure of their next steps, adding that it all depends on how Carnival compensates them. Others looked at the incident differently calling it an \"adventure.\" \"A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun,\" said one young passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. \"We went to the Kids' Camp.\" He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? \"Being stranded in the middle of the ocean,\" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the incident. But later in the day the safety board said officials from Panama would lead the investigation because that is the country the vessel is flagged under. The U.S. Coast  Guard will also be part of the investigation, the transportation board said."}]}

Some nations, including Russia. having previously pressed for internet controls and censorship, while others, including a U.S. delegation, pressing for web freedom. Time to conference call: Participants listen to the speech of Hamdoun Toure, Secretary General of the International Telecommunication, at the Dubai conference . Some delegates at the Dubai conference - including a 123-member U.S. delegation with envoys from tech giants such as Google and Microsoft - worry that any new U.N. ruling could be used by nations such as China and Russia to justify further tightening of Web blocks and monitoring. Even Google got political as the . conference started, placing a message on its homepage today which reads: . 'Love the free and open Internet? Tell . the world's governments to keep it that way'. The 11-day conference highlights the . fundamental shift from tightly-managed telecommunications networks to . the borderless sweep of the Internet. The Dubai gathering will confront questions that include how much sway the U.N. can exert over efforts such as battling cyber-crimes and expanding the Internet into developing nations. The secretary-general of the U.N. International Telecommunications Union, Hamadoun Toure, said that accusations how the meeting could limit Web freedoms is 'completely untrue' and predicted only 'light-touch' regulations. Google gets political: The search engine posted a link as it campaigned to keep the Internet regulation-free . 'Many countries will come to reaffirm their desire to see freedom of expression embedded in this conference,' he told reporters on the meeting's opening day. However, the outcome of the Dubai gathering is far from certain. The 193 nations at the meeting have put forward more than 900 proposed regulatory changes covering the Internet, mobile roaming fees and satellite and fixed-line communications. Broad consensus is needed for any item to be adopted for any changes - the first major review of the U.N.'s telecommunications agenda since 1988, well before the Internet age. The gathering is also powerless to force nations to change their Internet policies, such as China's notorious 'Great Firewall' and widespread blackouts of political opposition sites in places including Iran and the Gulf Arab states. Last week, Syria's Internet and telephone services disappeared for two days during some of the worst fighting in months to hit the capital, Damascus. Switch on: Any attempts for increased Web regulations are likely to face stiff opposition from groups led by a major U.S. delegation . The head of the U.S. delegation in Dubai, Ambassador Terry Kramer, told reporters last week in Washington that all efforts should be made to avoid a 'Balkanization' of the Internet in which each country would impose its own rules and standards that could disrupt the flow of commerce and information. 'That opens the door ... to content censorship,' he said. The International Trade Union Confederation, representing labor groups in more than 150 countries, claimed a bloc that includes China, Russia and several Middle East nations seeks to 'pave the way for future restrictions on both internet content or its users.' 'It is clear that some governments have an interest in changing the rules and regulations of the Internet,' the confederation said in statement Monday. Another likely battle that will take place in Dubai is over European-backed suggestions to change the pay structure of the Web to force content providers - such as Google, Facebook Inc. and others - to kick in an extra fee to reach users across borders. Advocates of the changes say the money raised could pay to expand broadband infrastructures in developing countries. Toure said he hoped for a 'landmark' accord on trying to bring broadband Internet to developing countries. 'The Internet remains out of reach for 2/3 of world's people,' said Toure, who is from Mali. The U.N. telecommunications agency dates back to 1865, when the telegraph revolutionized the speed of information. Over the decades, it has expanded to include telephone, satellite and other advances in communications."}]}

David Miliband today admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother in their bitter struggle for the Labour leadership three years ago. But the former foreign secretary added his relationship with younger brother Ed is 'healing' and there was no point 'looking in the rear view mirror'. The ex-MP spoke candidly to veteran broadcaster Andrew Marr, who returned to his BBC show on Sunday, just six months after suffering a stroke. Hard to forget: David Milliband (right) has admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother, Ed during the 2010 Labour leadership contest . The interview was Mr Miliband's last before he moves to New York to head up the International Rescue Committee charity. Although he did not completely rule out a comeback, he added that leaving British politics would ensure an end to the 'soap opera' of the brothers' rivalry. Mr Miliband said: 'The truth is I did not think I would be in this position.But I am now, I'm excited, I am engaged. Of course I am sad to go, but I am excited by the challenge ahead.' He added: 'These things, you can never erase them from memory or history. 'But Ed and I are brothers for life. That is something that you value and that you nurture whatever the difficulty of the circumstances.' Asked if his relationship with Ed was 'healing', Mr Miliband replied: 'Of course.' Comparing the brothers to Wimbledon tennis finalists Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, he continued: 'The important thing though is that you've got to never lead your life by looking in the rear view mirror. 'You can't afford to end up eating yourself up with that kind of struggle. 'You've got to try and say, there are the Murrays of this world who win and there are the Djokovics who come second. You've got to be gracious when you don't win.' Sibling love: David Miliband (right) said he and Ed are 'brothers for life' and that their relationship is 'healing' Mr Miliband also rejected the idea that Britain was entering a period where the only governments would be coalitions. 'I think the conventional assumption that we are bound to get a coalition is wrong,' he said. 'In the end the British people will take a view and I think that is a great prize for Labour. The danger is that could be a great prize for the Tories as well. 'Remember, the polls are meaningless at this stage because they start with the question: 'How would you vote if there was an election tomorrow?' 'There isn't an election tomorrow. People will come to a judgement about the future of the country in two years' time, and I would say it is all to play for, it is open. 'I don't think anyone on either side should be banking on the fact that it is bound to be a coalition. 'I don't see it that way.' Fresh start: David Miliband gave his last interview on Sunday before moving to New York to head up the International rescue Committee ."}]}

Even today -- when most Hollywood movies don't exactly fade to black after the lovers lock lips -- the best kisses still have the power to send shivers down the spine. In honor of Valentine's Day, InStyle chose the most memorable cinematic embraces: upside down, on a boat, and in the pouring rain. \"Gone with the Wind\" \"You need kissing badly,\" Clark Gable, as Rhett Butler, told Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara in this 1939 epic. \"You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how.\" Later on, while proposing to the twice-widowed Scarlett, he proves he's the man for the job. See all 25 iconic movie kisses . \"Lady and the Tramp\" She was the original uptown girl; he was a lovable drifter. But when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film, it was forever. \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" Truman Capote's original 1958 novella wasn't exactly a love story, so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation. (For one thing, he'd wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly.) But audiences adored this stylish film, particularly for the final scene, in which Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset. InStyle.com: The most stylish celebrity couples . \"When Harry Met Sally\" This 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a (still-raging) debate as to whether men and women could \"really\" be friends -- but it was the pair's New Year's Eve reconciliation that moved viewers to tears. As Billy Crystal (Harry) told Meg Ryan (Sally): \"I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.\" \"Pretty Woman\" \"I don't kiss on the mouth,\" Vivian (Julia Roberts) warns Edward (Richard Gere) at the beginning of this 1990 movie. So when she does, it's pivotal -- the audience understands that she's come to regard Edward as much more than a client. But even that kiss can't beat the one at the happy ending, after Edward \"rescues\" Vivian on her fire escape and she promises to \"rescue him right back.\" InStyle.com: Julia Roberts's Transformation . \"Ghost\" Technically, in this scene from the 1990 film, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) is making out with Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). But because Oda Mae is channeling Molly's late boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), it's Sam that Molly -- and the viewers -- get to see. \"Titanic\" Director James Cameron initially planned to cast \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" to play the female lead in this 1997 epic, and Leonardo DiCaprio nearly turned down his role. It's still captivating to see him woo Kate Winslet's Rose, even if, as DiCaprio said in a recent interview, kissing Kate is \"like kissing a family member.\" InStyle.com: Kate Winslet's Transformation . \"Spiderman\" The upside down kiss that Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) shared with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) in this 2002 flick was breath-taking for Maguire, but not for the reasons you might think. \"The whole time I had rainwater running up my nose,\" he said. \"Then, when Kirsten rolled back the mask, she cut my air off completely.\" \"Slumdog Millionaire\" It was easy to see why Jamal (Dev Patel) was so hung up on his childhood friend Latika (Freida Pinto). When they finally kiss on a Mumbai train platform, it's a moment as exuberantly optimistic as the goofy dance scene that follows. Bonus points for still being a couple to this off-screen day. InStyle.com: Freida Pinto's Transformation . \"Twilight\" Even the most diehard members of Team Jacob can't deny the romantic power of Bella and Edward's first kiss. Kristen Stewart -- who's almost uniformly closemouthed about her off-screen relationship with costar Robert Pattinson -- did offer \"I get to kiss Edward Cullen,\" when asked to name a few of her favorite things about the gig.

A young crater in the red planet's southern hemisphere contains well-preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water. Scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old, so the water features must have appeared since then, the scientists claim. Scroll down for video... This photo shows debris flowing on Mars (top and bottom left). The Martian landforms were shown to be similar to  known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean (bottom right) The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. \u2018Gullies are common on Mars but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age,\u2019 said lead scientist Dr Andreas Johnsson, from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. \u2018Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. \u2018This suggests that the melt water-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times.\u2019 The crater had features that were characteristic of debris flows on Earth caused by material being carried and then deposited by fast-moving water. The Martian landforms were compared with known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean. \u2018Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,\u2019 said Dr Johnsson, whose findings appear in the scientific journal Icarus. \u2018What surprised us was that the crater in which these debris flows have formed is so young.\u2019 The study crater is located in the mid-latitudes of the Martian southern hemisphere and superimposed on the \u2018rampart ejecta\u2019 of a nearby larger crater. Rampart ejecta, which display flower-like features, are believed to be the result of a meteor impact on wet or icy ground. The scientists first thought the recent water flow features had come from preserved ice within the rampart ejecta. However, structures such as faults or fractures that could have acted as conduits for the melt water were missing. \u2018It is more likely that the water has come from melting snow packs, when the conditions were favourable for snow formation,\u2019 said Dr Johnsson. \u2018This is possible since the orbital axis of Mars was more tilted in the past than it is today.\u2019 Evidence of water on Mars dates back . to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971.

Labour today comfortably held Feltham and Heston in the by-election with an increased majority over the Conservatives. Labour candidate Seema Malhotra was returned with a majority of 6,203 - a net swing of 8.6 per cent from the Conservatives. On a night which saw a turnout of under 29 per cent - the lowest in a by-election for 11 years - the Liberal Democrats managed to see off a challenge from the UK Independence Party to hold on to third place. Triumph: Labour candidate Seema Malhotra (centre) celebrates with her husband Sushil Saluja (front left) after winning the Feltham and Heston by-election in the early hours of this morning . The result came as a relief to Labour leader Ed Miliband who needed a victory if he was not to face a fresh bout of questioning over his leadership. He hailed the by-election success as a 'verdict on the Government's failed economic plan'. Addressing supporters in Feltham town centre, Mr Miliband called on the Tories to 'listen' to voters. He said: 'I think it is pretty offensive that the Conservatives are saying this morning \"Well, what do you expect? It's a traditional Labour area\". 'They shouldn't be denying the people's choice, they should be listening to the people's verdict. 'I think that is one of the things people really don't like about this government - that they don't listen. They really need to start listening. The triumphant candidate said her victory is a 'wake-up call' for Prime Minister David Cameron. Important message: Ms Malhotra delivers her winning speech as the unsuccessful candidates, Lib Dem Roger Crouch (centre) and Tory Mark Bowen (head bowed), listen on at the Civic Centre in Hounslow, west London . Ms Malhotra said: 'Even on a lower turnout we've increased substantially our majority and the Tories have got to be asking the question of why. 'This is a really important message that's been sent to Mr Cameron.' The Conservatives however said Labour . should have extended their majority even further if they were looking . to be on course for victory at the next general election, set for 2015. The defeated Tory candidate Mark Bowen insisted that he was 'proud' of the result, despite seeing his party's share of the vote fall. 'We have done a lot better than the pollsters and bookmakers suggested we would do,' he said. For the Lib Dems there was relief that they avoided the humiliation of being beaten into fourth place, despite a sharp fall in their share of the vote. Delight: Supporters celebrate Ms Malhotra's victory, which increased Labour's share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent . Lib Dem candidate Roger Crouch said: 'We have shown that we are still resilient and still relevant.' However Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Lib Dems were 'almost a busted flush'. 'People are turning to Ukip as they realise we are serious when it comes to putting Britain first,' he said. Ukip had been hoping to overhaul the Lib Dems but admitted their chances had been damaged by David Cameron's decision to wield the veto at the Brussels summit, which gave the Tories a fillip in the final week of the campaign. Labour increased their share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent with a net swing of 8.6per cent from the Tories. The Conservative vote share was down from 34per cent to 28per cent, while the Lib Dems dropped from nearly 14per cent to under 6per cent. In contrast, Ukip saw its vote share more than double from 2per cent to over 5per cent. The parliamentary by-election was sparked by the death last month of veteran Labour MP Alan Keen after he lost his battle with cancer.

Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, who is the only woman to be convicted by the court, was minister for family and women's affairs in the Rwandan government when some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis, were killed in 1994. She was accused of direct and public incitement to commit genocide and of being responsible for rape \"as part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic and racial grounds,\" the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a militia leader who was jointly charged in the case, was also convicted Friday of genocide, crimes against humanity including rape and persecution and war crimes, and sentenced to life in prison. Four local officials who were accused alongside Nyiramasuhuko and her son were all found guilty of genocide and other charges. They were handed prison terms ranging from 25 years to life. Nyiramasuhuko, who was arrested in 1997 in Kenya, and taken to the U.N. court in Tanzania to await trial, was found guilty of seven of the counts she faced, ICTR spokesman Roland Amoussouga told CNN. They included charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity including rape and persecution. Two charges were dismissed, one of complicity to commit genocide and a second relating to murder and crimes against humanity. She was also cleared of two charges, one alleging direct and public incitement to commit genocide and another of inhumane acts and crimes against humanity. The court found that Nyiramasuhuko was a member of the Interim Government that issued directives whose intention \"was to encourage the population to hunt down and take action against the 'enemy' and its 'accomplices'; terms which referred to Tutsis in general.\" Nyiramasuhuko also participated in many Cabinet meetings at which the massacre of Tutsis was discussed, \"and she took part in the decisions that triggered the onslaught of massacres in Butare prefecture.\" Between April and mid-June 1994, hundreds of Tutsis were rounded up by militia members in her home district of Butare and many subjected to assaults and rape, the court said. During this time, Nyiramasuhuko ordered killings and \"aided and abetted rapes\" of vulnerable civilians, some of which were committed by her son, the court said. The six sentenced Friday will remain in detention in Tanzania pending an appeals process. If their convictions are upheld, the head of the tribunal will then decide what state to transfer them to to serve their sentences, said Amoussouga, the ICTR spokesman. The ICTR said it had been a complex and lengthy case, involving 189 witnesses and almost 13,000 pages of documents. While Nyiramasuhuko is the only woman to have been convicted by the ICTR, other women have been jailed for their roles in the genocide by courts elsewhere. A Roman Catholic nun was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a traditional Rwandan court in 2006 for her part in the killings. Two other Catholic nuns were found guilty of genocide charges by a court in Belgium in 2001. The Rwandan genocide was triggered by the April 6, 1994, shooting down of a plane carrying the nation's Hutu president. Ethnic violence erupted and Tutsis were killed systematically by Hutus. The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the Rwandan genocide. In all, 800,000 men, women, and children -- mostly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus -- died. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report."}]}

Rooney, who died of natural causes at age 93 on Sunday, also did not want his stepson Chris Aber to attend his funeral, attorney Michael Augustine said. Rooney's wishes are the basis for a looming court fight over who controls the legendary actor's remains and makes funeral and burial decisions, Augustine said. While Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over. His personal property is valued at just $18,000 despite an unmatched 90-year film career. Augustine, who served as Rooney's conservator, said in a court filing that he believed Rooney's estranged wife, Jan Rooney, and her son, Christopher Aber, would attempt to remove Rooney's body from Forest Lawn Memorial Park's mortuary. A Los Angeles judge signed a handwritten order Tuesday preventing anyone from removing Rooney's remains until he holds a hearing on Friday. Augustine, who is named as estate executor in the will, is asking for that authority. Attorney Yevgeny Belous, who works with lawyer Mitchell Karasov to represent Jan Rooney, said she is the only person with authority to make the decisions. Lawyers for both sides are \"working toward the mutual goal of honoring Mickey,\" perhaps with an agreement on funeral and burial arrangements, before Friday's hearing, Belous said. \"We want Mickey to have a proper ceremony,\" he said. \"We don't want to drag this into a fight.\" Rooney already purchased burial plots in a cemetery in the Westlake Village area of Los Angeles County. In fact, Rooney's mother was moved there years ago so the family would be together, Belous said. Augustine said Rooney told him shortly before his death that he no longer wanted to be buried in the plot he purchased 15 years earlier. \"Substantial intervening events\" in the years since changed his wishes, but Rooney's lack of cash prevented him from purchasing a new burial plot, he said. Rooney expressed a desire to be interred at either a veteran's cemetery or a Hollywood cemetery with other stars. Hollywood Forever, the final resting place for Rudolph Valentino, Cecil B. DeMille and a long list of long gone show biz A-listers, is one possibility, Augustine said. Augustine said he doubts a deal can be made before the judge imposes a decision, since he is demanding that Aber be banned from the funeral because of Mickey Rooney's severe dislike for the stepson who previously managed him. Rooney won a $2.8 million judgment against Aber in a lawsuit that included accusations of elder abuse. Aber has yet to pay the judgment, Augustine said. Jan Rooney signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012 after 34 years of marriage, according to a court filing. She will benefit from Rooney's Social Security and other pensions totaling $8,400 a month, Augustine said. While Rooney was the highest paid actor in Hollywood 70 years ago, his personal property totaled just $18,000, according to documents accompanying his will. Rooney: A spokesman against elder abuse . The will signed by Rooney on March 11, 2014, left the entire estate to stepson Mark Rooney, one of Jan Rooney's sons, who was the actor's caretaker the last two years of his life. Rooney \"intentionally omitted\" and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said. He believed what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in the final two years, Augustine said. None of the others \"ever changed one of Mickey's Depends,\" Augustine said. A probate hearing is scheduled for May 12 to start the process of probating the actor's will."}]}

Cuban officials said Thursday that they had no comment on the Panamanian allegations. In July, Cuba's foreign ministry issued a statement that said the undeclared shipment discovered aboard the ship consisted of obsolete weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before being returned to Cuba. But Panamanian officials have said that under 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar, they found operational weaponry, including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives. \"The Cuban weapons on the North Korean ship undeniably violated the U.N. weapons embargo,\" said a statement issued Wednesday by Panama's Ministry of Public Security, citing a preliminary report by U.N. weapons inspectors who inspected the ship. Despite Cuba's assertions that the weapons were being sent for repairs, the shipment may have been intended to bolster North Korea's own defenses. \"North Korea is very interested in maintaining its MiG-21 fleet,\" said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defence Weekly. \"It may be a 50-year-old plane, but it's very fast and capable in a dogfight.\" Still, Hardy said, if the shipment was part of an illegal arms deal, it remains to be seen what further sanctions Cuba or North Korea could face. \"The U.N. sanctions are very strict,\" he said. \"But the consequences are not clear.\" While authorities have not said what will become of the Cuban weapons, the North Korean crew may finally be heading home. Panamanian authorities met Wednesday with North Korean diplomats and said they agreed to begin the process of repatriating the 35-member North Korean crew, who have been held in Panama after initially trying to prevent authorities from searching the ship. That ship, the Chong Chon Gang, could also be returned to North Korea after repairs are made. According to the Panamanian statement, the crew rendered the ship inoperable during the struggle to keep customs authorities from boarding it. Although secret shipments of arms between North Korea and Cuba were not previously well-known, they apparently have taken place for decades. In July, former President Fidel Castro wrote that in the 1980s, North Korea sent Cuba 100,000 AK-47 rifles after the Soviet Union denied the island military aid that could be used to repel a feared U.S. invasion. \"They did not charge us a cent,\" Castro wrote of the North Korean shipments."}]}

Dramatic video showed tiny Azra Karaduman being carried by rescuers to a vehicle that would take her to the hospital. They were holding a mask over her mouth to help give her oxygen. Later, rescuers pulled the girl's mother and paternal grandmother alive from the rubble as well. Officials said the 2-week-old girl's father remained trapped somewhere under the debris of the multiple-story building. Over several hours, four corpses were pulled from the rubble of the same building, officials said. At least one of them was male. Officials did not say immediately whether one of the bodies was the baby's father. The official death toll jumped to 459 Tuesday, with another 1,352 people injured, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency said. Teams of rescuers throughout the poor region struck by Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake are searching for survivors around the clock. Reaching Azra -- who, according to her maternal grandmother, was born three weeks prematurely -- was particularly difficult, rescuers told CNN. The baby's mother managed to make contact with rescuers and get the baby to them through a narrow passage, a rescuer said. Officials had to find a rescuer thin enough to fit into the crevice to get Azra. The rescuer told CNN it was the first time he had ever pulled someone alive from earthquake rubble in 12 years of doing such work. While rescuers worked to get to the mother and grandmother, they managed to supply the two women with oxygen, officials said. \"It was hard to rescue them\" because of the tight space, said rescue worker Tansu Bayram. \"It was so difficult.\" Some 2,262 buildings in the region lie in ruins. The military is assisting rescue workers, who are using heavy machinery, shovels, and their bare hands. Numerous aftershocks -- the largest a magnitude 6.0 -- have rattled the area, which is one of the poorest in Turkey. One on Tuesday measured 5.7, and was 7 km (4.3 miles) deep. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van. The Turkish Red Crescent said about 25 apartment buildings and a student dormitory also collapsed in the town. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. The injured were being treated in the hospital's garden. \"People are really scared,\" CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu said from Van on Monday. \"The survivors are now trying to survive the cold weather.\" Rescuers and survivors contended with near-freezing temperatures. Some people collected wood from collapsed buildings to burn for warmth, Mengu said. She said many residents are not returning to their houses, opting instead to sleep on rooftops or in the streets. It was not clear whether their homes were uninhabitable or if they were just too frightened. Are you there? Submit your pictures or video . The Red Crescent called for rescue workers, machinery and drinking water. A crisis center was set up by the country's Health Ministry in the Turkish capital of Ankara. By Monday, more than 2,300 emergency personnel were in the region, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said. Tents and rescue teams have come from as far away as Iran and Azerbaijan. Israel's Ministry of Defense said that on Wednesday, a plane with several portable housing structures will fly to eastern Turkey, the first of a number of flights accommodating a Turkish request for assistance. It will be a civilian plane rented by the Israeli government, the ministry said. \"The United Nations is in contact with the relevant authorities and stands ready to offer any assistance if requested,\" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said Monday. Turkey is \"no stranger to having these seismic events,\" but Sunday's quake is considered major, CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said. A magnitude-7.6 earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A magnitude-7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the agency reported. Sunday's quake struck at 1:41 p.m. local time and was centered about 12 miles from Van, the agency said.

According to notes of the meeting, . seen by the Daily Telegraph, BBC staff were told: \u2018Do not call him an . extremist \u2013 we must call him a radical. Extremist implies a value . judgement.\u2019 Last night MPs were left speechless at the edict, which has also mystified members of the BBC\u2019s own staff. Philip Davies, an MP who sits on the . culture, media and sport select committee, said: \u2018I thought it was a . joke. You really can\u2019t make it up. BBC journalists were told that they should avoid making 'value judgments' when describing the radical preacher . Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said Qatada hadn't committed a crime . Abu Qatada 'has not committed any crime' and we cannot blame European human rights for his release, Ken Clarke has said. The Justice Secretary said it was a British judge who granted him bail, and it did not have 'anything to do with the European Court'. Speaking at the Oldie magazine awards in central London, Mr Clarke told The Daily Telegraph: 'I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the European Court, it is a question of how long you can detain someone who is not accused of committing a crime and no body intends to charge him with anything.' Qatada is wanted in Jordan to stand trial for his alleged involvement in a Millennium bomb plot. Mark Pritchard, Tory MP for The Wrekin . in Shropshire, said: \u2018This is a tragic paradox where a media . organisation seems to be curbing freedom of expression and choice of . words in news reporting. \u2018Some senior BBC personnel need to stop\u2026assuming everyone is as highly sensitive and politically correct as they are.\u2019 Yesterday the corporation released a statement saying it did not ban words. But according to insiders it had told staff to avoid using the term. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018It is not . uncommon for us to discuss how we cover stories impartially and we . always think very carefully about the language we use. \u2018In terms of pictures, as with any story, this is a reminder to use the most up-to-date photos for accuracy.\u2019"}]}

Undercover: Frenando Jara spent five years under the guise of a radical Muslim after the 9/11 attacks . It may sound far-fetched, but a California man says he lived a real life spy thriller when he became an unlikely secret agent. Fernando Jara, of Kern County, spent five years completely off the grid beginning in 2001 when the seemingly normal guy joined the ranks of America's most clandestine agency. It was shortly after the September 11 attacks when Jara, who had recently converted to Islam, sent an email to the CIA, offering his services as a spy. To his surprise, the feds got back to him, and offered him the job, Jara told the Los Angeles Times. He had dropped out of high school, and at the time was working toward his equivalency degree at community college. Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons. He was also connected with David Manning of Ventura, California, who taught the then-26-year-old how to handle knives and guns. Manning told the LA Times: 'They said he was under the radar and getting ready to go to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. I told them, \"I'm not doing this.\" I didn't believe them.' Jara credits Manning with turning him into 'a one-man army.' The next five years of Jara's life have remained a pretty guarded secret, but he tells the LA Times that he infiltrated numerous terror training camps in Yemen and Afghanistan while posing as a radical Muslim. The paper reached out to the FBI and CIA for comment on Jara, but both agencies declined to comment. 'One-man army': Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons . After several years in the spy game, . Jara's cover was exposed in a Yemen bar when a fellow patron said that . he was either a combatant or a foreign intelligence official. After that incident, Jara was ordered to escape Yemen. Upon his return to the U.S., things began to go downhill for Jara, who had developed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. But thanks to the kindness of Cal State Professor Mark Baker, who took in a distraught Jara after finding out he had been living in his car. Top secret: Undercover, Jara infiltrated terror camps in Afghanistan and Yemen . From there, things began to improve for him. In 2011, Jara married Leticia Perez, a public defender who now serves as Kern County supervisor, the first Latina to hold the post. Today, Jara, who runs the RockHill Farm - a rehabilitation clinic for drug and gang crime offenders - suffers from PTSD and often struggles with some of the violent memories. He told the Times: 'I'm ashamed of some of the things that happened over there. I don't hurt people anymore. My soul couldn't take it.' Today: Jara carries his toddler son on RockHill Farm, the rehabilitation clinic for drug and gang crime offenders that he runs . Painful past: Jara, right, still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and often struggles with the memories ."}]}

The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic Caribbean island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned. The family of murdered Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death . However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island. Mr Gobat\u2019s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: \u2018We\u2019re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action. \u2018Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.\u2019 The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty. The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently. Oliver Gobat, 38, was shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover (pictured) Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have launched a private investigation into the suspected contract killing. The couple have put up a \u00a360,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers. The manner of Mr Gobat\u2019s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat\u2019s death was \u2018no ordinary murder\u2019 and it had \u2018all the hallmarks of a professional killing\u2019. Paradise: Cap Maison's estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean once run by Mr Gobat . The boutique hotel, pictured, is five star and is based on the coast of the island . Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver. Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa. Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt. He and another director successfully took over the company's hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison. His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia."}]}

Jailed: Janet Chapman abandoned her jury duty to enjoy a week long holiday in Malta . A woman juror who abandoned a four-week robbery trial to jet off on holiday to Malta was jailed last night for 56 days for contempt of court. Janet Chapman, 51, said she thought it would fine to travel abroad for a week because her doctor had signed her off work due to a bad back. The next day she phoned the court and left a telephone message saying: \u2018Hello, this is Janet Chapman.... I won\u2019t be attending court for a period of up to two weeks. 'I have got to return to the doctor\u2019s next Tuesday. I have got sciatica. Thankyou. Bye.\u2019 She then flew off to enjoy some winter sun on a \u00a3669 week-long holiday in Malta with her long-time partner Raymond Pritchard. But she had a nasty surprise when she touched down at Liverpool Airport as a welcoming party of police officers was waiting to arrest her. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: \u2018It is clear you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure. \u2018Your assertion that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous. \u2018I am satisfied that if you really . suffered back pain of such severity that that you could not continue . your jury service you would not have been able to endure the travel to . Malta. \u2018I am driven to the . conclusion that you pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem . in order that you could take a holiday in Malta.\u2019 Busted: Chapman was caught after an official at Preston Crown court noticed she had called from a foreign number . Preston Crown Court heard potential jurors were told to indicate if they had a holiday or hospital admission which would leave them unable to sit on a serious robbery trial. At the start of the trial of robbery suspect Raymond Mallen, Chapman did not notify the court why she should not be part of the jury. He was accused of being part of an organised gang which carried out a . series of high value cash-in-transit robberies across the North West of . England. Evidence had been . heard and Judge Stuart Baker was about to begin summing up when Chapman . phoned the courts and left her message. Yesterday . she told the court the holiday last month had been a birthday surprise . from her partner and she had only learned about the trip the night . before they flew out. Chapman, a deputy manager at a children\u2019s residential home, said that having suffered a back injury and been signed off sick from work she didn\u2019t think she would have to attend the trial. She said: \u2018On the Monday morning I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I went to the doctor that night. I was signed off for a week. I didn\u2019t think I was doing anything wrong.\u2019 Surprise: Chapman's partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he had booked the \u00a3669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before . Her partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he booked the \u00a3669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before. Judge Russell said it had been a serious contempt of court. He said: \u2018You have manifestly failed to perform your public duty. Further, it is clear that you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure, namely taking a holiday in Malta.\u2019 The case carried on and Mallen was convicted of conspiracy to rob and jailed 12 years. Various gang members have now been jailed for a total of more than 80 years in all. Last night Mr Pritchard choked back tears at his semi-detached property on the outskirts of Blackpool and said the mistake would cost them dear.. He said: \u2018Obviously we did not know what the consequences would be. I have never stepped into a court of any kind until today. This could well lose my wife her job. She works with children and it is a job she loves. \u2018Janet has never done anyone any harm. Then to come home from holiday and get arrested at the airport, it was terrible. I have not heard from her since she was jailed I don\u2019t know when she will be able to phone me. \u2018I think what has happened is like using a jack hammer to crack a nut. I don\u2019t know how she will cope behind bars...I just told her to survive it.\u2019 Last year juror Matthew Banks, 19, was jailed for 14 days after phoning a court and saying he was ill so he could go and watch a West End musical with his mother. He was released four days later on appeal.

But I can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u2019 Popeye \u2013 named because it has lost an eye \u2013 was safe in its tank last Tuesday when its owner gave it a mouse to eat. But when Miss Honey returned a little later, she found the mouse untouched and the snake missing. She said she would usually be confident of finding the three-year-old pet in the house, but the doors had been left open because of the hot weather. \u2018The neighbours are not happy, and that\u2019s understandable, but she\u2019s of no risk to anyone,\u2019 added Miss Honey.

This is the moment an innocent puffin trying to feed its young was robbed by a greedy gull. Having scoured the Northumbrian coast for food, the helpless victim had not noticed a predator watching from a nearby rock. It was not until he hit the jackpot and set off for home clutching a batch of five sand eels that the gull made its move. Success: With a batch of sand eels in its iconic beak the doting parent gets ready to head home . Coast seems clear: He sets off, clutching the meal. Not far from his roost, it shouldn't be a long flight . Noticing a second too late, the puffin tried to change course. But the bigger bird was ready. In an alarming display of survival-of-the-fittest, the pair tumbled to the ground of the Farne Islands in a bid to win the meal. The incredible scene, captured by amateur photographer Steve Evans, escalated on dry land. The determined puffin made a run for it on foot. And despite being apprehended by the savvy gull, all was not lost for the breadwinner who proudly walked away with one of the two remaining fish. Puffin enthusiast Mr Evans, 50, said: 'I saw the gull spot the puffin whilst on a rocky outcrop, as it took to the air, the puffin saw it and tried to change direction. Shock: Out of nowhere a giant predator swoops. The black-headed gull tries to turn to grab the eels . Attacked: The puffin had caught some sand eels off the coast of the Farne Islands in Northumbria . 'The gull attempted to hood its wings around the puffin and pecked at its fish-laden bill. 'The gull managed to dislodge a small sand eel, as this dropped from the air another bird spotted it and got to it before the gull. 'The gull managed to get a fish from the puffin, once this happened the gull seemed to leave the puffin alone. 'It got back to its burrow with some fish intact.' Puffins are phenomenal swimmers and hunters as they adopt a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their . wings rapidly, over 400 times-per-minute. Plan B: The tussle moves to dry land where the determined puffin tries to leg it with his food still intact . Relieved but exhausted: Usually known for its speed, this puffin only took home some of his earnings . The black-headed gull is an arch-nemesis of the Atlantic Puffin breed, which resides in the British Isles. To avoid danger, the black and white auks tend to fly together in confusing formations. Their fast pace and stark colours alarm predators. Fascinated by these black and white creatures, known for their super-fast swimming technique, Mr Evans from Wakefield, Yorkshire, planned this photography expedition months ago. Lucky: During the tussle a nearby tern made off with one of the prized snacks as the gull and puffin fought away . He said: 'For many years I have had an interest in the outdoors and the countryside, working several dogs on large Yorkshire estates. 'I have always had a liking for Puffins, this comical bird, but wanted to . photograph them during the breeding season when they spend time on land.' Lundy Island, the largest island in the Bristol Channel, near Devon, is named after the Norse word for 'puffin' Puffins are the symbol of Newfound and Labrador province in Canada, and the namesake of Lundy Island (from 'lund', the Norse word for puffin). The iconic birds are still hunted and eaten in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. There are three types of puffin, which are members of the auk family. The Tufted Puffin, an almost black creature, is native to the North Pacific. The Horned Puffin, with a fleshy horn above its beak, resides in cold climates like Siberia and Alaska. The Atlantic Puffin, or 'common puffin', is native to the North Atlantic and the British Isles. Puffins are known for their ability to swim. They soar through the water, flapping their wings as if flying through the air. In a technique unrivalled by other land-based creatures, the black and white creatures have become adept at hunting."}]}

Raheem Sterling (left, tussling with Cristiano Ronaldo) was another star who started on the bench . Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend. Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli . Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid: . Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas 7; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini . Most of those standing flummoxed in the away section high up in the gods here last night were perhaps past caring about the small details by kick off. The decision had been made and Liverpool, as a result, were finished before they even began. This was sport, but only in name. It is hard to win at Madrid. Since 1957, only one English team apart from Liverpool has managed it. Arsenal in 2006. The key fact here, though, is that the others have come to this magnificent stadium and tried. To return to an earlier point, that is called sport. You turn up, take a deep breath, put your gloves on or your shin pads and you go out and try to do something special. Bobby Robson tried with Ipswich here in 1973 and got a draw. Brian Clough lost 5-1 with Derby after winning a European Cup first leg 4-1. He went home with a broken heart and a sense of injustice but at least he tried, just as David O\u2019Leary did in losing 3-2 with Leeds in 2001.

Kolo Toure (left) holds off Benzema in what was an impressive display by the Liverpool defender . CLICK HERE for DOMINIC KING'S ratings from the Bernabeu to find out how the surprise Liverpool starters fared . His team led that night. Only for a minute, but just imagine what that minute must have felt like. We could go on. We could talk about narrow failures here for both Manchester teams. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers can dress this team selection up all he likes. He can call it pragmatic or realistic but it is neither of those things, really. It just felt fundamentally wrong and the fact that the defeat was narrow and the performance spirited does not change that. The result should not serve as vindication of Rodgers\u2019 methods. The scoreline was a fluke, reflective not of Real\u2019s clear dominance but of the fact that Liverpool\u2019s lack of competitiveness almost sent their opponents to sleep. Emre Can (right) was a surprise starter for Liverpool but failed to impress in Madrid . Fabio Borini started up front for Liverpool in place of Mario Balotelli . 137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That\u2019s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 130 -\u00a0The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool\u2019s starting XI. 642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid\u2019s starting XI. \u00a359 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu last night. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels. 27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That\u2019s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield. 2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to last night. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium. 3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers\u2019 team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. The game was played in an almost dreamlike atmosphere, as though Madrid knew they would win. When they scored, in the 27th minute, the roof hardly came off the place. By half-time, Real had taken 13 shots on goal to Liverpool\u2019s none. That is not what we hoped for when the draw threw these two great clubs together. Afterwards, Rodgers\u2019 stated belief in his own methods was impressive enough. It is a relevant quality. He has not done much wrong since arriving at Anfield two summers ago but this selection flew quite spectacularly in the face of all he has preached. Back then he talked romantically about sitting on the floor of his grandfather\u2019s house watching great Liverpool European nights on TV. What he will not have watched is Bob Paisley sending his stiffs out. Back then they didn\u2019t even get on the plane, never mind the pitch. Real are a very good football team. They were not the best team in Spain last season, though. Or, indeed, the second best.\u00a0They lost five times, including twice at home. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle . Adam Lallana (centre) grew into the game as it went on and justified his starting place . They have improved since then and were far too good for Liverpool two weeks ago. In Rodgers\u2019 mind, though, they have been clearly been built up in to a monster. He obviously believes them to be unbeatable and perhaps that is the greatest sin of all. No manager \u2014 in any sport \u2014 should ever think that. If we all thought that way, we may as well scrap the FA Cup. This was, in effect, a team selection designed principally to avoid collateral damage that may affect an entirely different game \u2014 against Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League \u2014 that is still three days away. And if that is the way a manager thinks, what chance do his players have? Results can change seasons. Just one result. Who knows? For Liverpool, this could have been the one. Liverpool fans who traveled to the Bernabeu may question Rodgers' decision to play a weakened team . Simon Mingolet (centre) rises to collect a cross and deny Cristiano Ronaldo an effort at goal . Instead, Liverpool now look like a team who feel they don\u2019t belong in Europe, a team who arrive at the really big venues seeking purely to avoid a hiding. Rodgers, meanwhile, must wait and see what this does for his own reputation \u2014 even if he claimed last night not to care. Just two weeks ago, the Liverpool manager told another Spanish newspaper \u2014 AS \u2014 that he would like to work over here one day. He may be waiting a while after this.

Ryan Williams, 24, was charged Friday with six counts of criminal homicide, arson and burglary for the October 18 house fire in McKeesport. The blaze killed 55-year-old Ronald Egenlauf Sr, 27-year-old Hope Jordan and her four children, aged 2 through 7. Arson: Ryan Williams, 24, set a Pittsburgh-area house ablaze, killing six people, including four children, in order to get revenge on the only survivor, Keith Egenlauf, 23, according to police . Williams allegedly told friends that he had stolen money and food from the house before setting a roll of toilet paper on fire and tossing it on the couch . According to detectives, Williams started the fire in order to exact revenge on Jordan's husband, Keith Egenlauf, 23, the only one to survive the blaze. A criminal complaint states that Williams was out to 'get Keith' because he believe Egenlauf had spoken with police after the paid had burglarized a home in 2013, according to police. After the fire, Williams told a friend that he had gone to the home where Egenlauf was living and found the back door open, according to the document. Williams walked up to the second floor of the house, took money out of a wallet and took food from the fridge before setting a toilet paper roll on fire and tossing it on the couch. On the night of the fire, he phoned the same friend and said 'I just did some crazy stuff. I\u2019m on my porch waiting for fire trucks,' as sirens were heard in the background, the complaint states. Another witness told detectives that Williams woke him early the day after the fire and told him he had 'just lit Keith's house on fire, and if anybody asks, I was here all night.' Arrested: One witness told investigators Williams had phoned on the night of the fire saying he did some 'crazy stuff,' and woke up another the day after the home burned down saying he did it . Children: Hope Jordan's children, ages 2 through 7, were found dead in an upstairs bedroom, though Williams claimed he didn't know anyone but Keith Egenlauf was home . Deceased: Keith Egenlauf (right) barely escaped the flames after trying unsuccessfully to save his wheelchair-bound father while his wife, Hope Jordan (left), ran to the children. One witness described how Williams cried after hearing on the news that the children had died, claiming he thought it was only Keith Egenlauf living in the house at the time. On Friday, Williams told WPXI that he did not know the children were inside the house when he set the fire. Egenlauf told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review he raced back into the house, trying to save his partially paralyzed father, Ronald. 'He could see I was in pain,' Egenlauf said, describing blistering heat around him as he tried to pull his father out of his wheelchair. 'I was screaming. I tried my best. He told me, \"Get out.\"' Though she had made it out of the house too, Jordan entered again and went upstairs for the children,\u00a0Dominic Jordan, 7, Autumn Jordan, 6, Serenity Jakub, 3, and Victoria Jakub, 2. Egenlauf said it was the first time in weeks the four were together with their mother. Two of the children were in foster care and visiting Jordan, who was charged in 2013 with child endangerment for leaving them in filthy conditions with her boyfriend at the time,\u00a0Andrew McGee. 'They called me \"Dad,\"' said Egenlauf, who would have celebrated his first wedding anniversary with Jordan in December. 'I treated them like my own. In my heart, they belonged to me.' Egenlauf was taken to the hospital in critical condition on the night of the fire, suffering burns over 55 percent of his body he is still healing from, WTAE reports, .

It sliced through his forearm to the bone, severing all the tendons, nerves and arteries in his wrist, leaving him in a pool of blood. Davy D'agostino, left, who almost cut off his arm after he slipped while carrying a vase up a flight of stairs. He had to undergo surgery and was bandaged, right after severing all the tendons, nerves and arteries in his wrist . The 37-year-old from Enfield, north London, was rushed to hospital where he spent three days having surgery on his torn tendons. He also had to have more than 30 stitches in his right arm to fix the six inch gash. Mr D'agostino said: 'I only took the job because I thought it would be a quieter way to earn some more money. 'When I slipped I dropped the vase, and it broke. I fell right on top of it and the glass sliced through my arm. 'I sliced open my left hand because I tried to put pressure on the wound and cut myself on a shard of glass that was sticking out of my arm. It was agony.' Mr D'agostino had previously worked as a professional dog handler and had been bitten, but says nothing could have prepared him for the pain. He explained: 'I\u2019ve been a professional dog handler for years, but I\u2019ve never seen a dog bite that bad. Mr D'agostino had to have more than 30 stitches, left, to fix the six inch gash. His arm has now started to heal, right, but he says he has been unable to work since the accident . 'I had my leg savaged by a Rottweiler once, but that was nowhere near as bad. 'My hand is still numb, and I\u2019ve got very limited movement - so I can\u2019t do either job. 'The doctors have told me that since I severed two nerves, the recovery time is estimated at at least seven years, and I will need more surgery in the coming months. 'I could have died I lost so much blood. Who would have thought working with flowers could have been so dangerous?' And since the accident in August, he says he has been unable to work. He added: 'Being a dog handler, it\u2019s par for the course that you\u2019re going to get bitten. 'So when I started working as a florist, I didn\u2019t ever think I could get any more injured than pricking my finger on a rose thorn.

Starring Kid Cudi as a car thief who falls in love with a blind Arabian princess, the clip is the project he was reportedly working on in the Middle East in February. The film's cast also includes Razane Jammal, Pusha T, Big Sean, Palestinian actor Ali Suliman, Aziz Ansari and West himself. As MTV points out, \"Cruel Summer\" is similar to West's 2010 short film \"Runaway\" in that it's an extended music video with little dialogue and plenty of striking imagery. \"Cruel Summer\" utilizes seven screens and features completely new music from West and his G.O.O.D. Music affiliates that will reportedly appear on an album, also titled Cruel Summer, set for release sometime this year. Reactions to the music have been overwhelmingly positive, with MTV calling it \"rocking\" and GQ senior editor Logan Hill tweeting from the premiere that the music \"was the best part -- big complex production, huge beats.\" The Hollywood Reporter noted multiple instances of chair-dancing in the audience. Response to the film has also been generally warm. The Los Angeles Times film blog 24 Frames wrote, \"The story is secondary to the pyrotechnics, with new music from West and a thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short.\" Vulture, meanwhile, praised West's \"great visual sense\" and noted the effectiveness of the special camera rig invented for the film to incorporate all seven screens, whether it was stretching a single shot across multiple screens or having each display a different image/angle during a single scene. \"The movie is all Kanye's vision -- his images, his music and costumes he designed, mixed with pieces by local Arabian designers,\" wrote Jada Yuan. \"He put it together in two-and-a-half months with only four days of actual shooting.\" In a speech following the film, West said, \"I was very particular about having the screens be separate and having it where your mind puts the screens back together -- the way you can put memories together, the way that happens throughout the day and it all links back up.\" Vulture also managed to score a comment from one of the many stars in attendance, Jay-Z. \"It's about the things that separate us -- race and class in society and things like that. But the only thing that really binds us is true love,\" he said. West said he will keep working on and improving the film, and he plans to bring it to Qatar and New York in the future. \"I'm not the best director in the world or anything like that, but I had an idea,\" said West during his post-film speech. \"I could dream of, one day, this being the way that people watch movies, in this form where it surrounds you and people want to go back and see it more and more because they missed something else to the left and missed something else to the right, and it felt more like the experience of life.\" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

The moment of truth: Ryan Swinburn could not collect his GCSE results until he paid his lunch bill . A teenager who almost died during a GCSE exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding \u00a35.60 lunch bill. Teachers told schoolboy Ryan Swinburn he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier. The 16-year-old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure, having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome. He was discharged from hospital in time to sit his GCSEs but almost died in May when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam. But he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt. Ryan, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said: 'It was all a bit ludicrous really. 'I\u2019ve had a tough time and because I wasn\u2019t at school I wasn\u2019t able to pay the bill. 'One of my teachers slyly told me I had got a C when I got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether I had done the same in any other subjects. 'But when my head of year told me I couldn\u2019t have them until I had settled a mere \u00a35.60 - I was shocked. 'I hadn\u2019t taken any money with me because I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about the outstanding bill for a pizza, baguette and a drink - I was more concerned about my health. 'I suffer from high blood pressure and I don\u2019t think that did me any good. 'I had to come away from the school not knowing if I had got into college or not, it was devastating and I was really angry.' Ryan was in his final year at Ashlawn . School in Rugby, when he was struck down with cardiolipin syndrome, . lupus disease and kidney failure. School Days: Ryan was in his final year at Ashlawn School in Rugby, Warwickshire . Exams: Ryan returned to Ashlawn School last month expecting to collect his GCSE results . He was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition. Incredibly, the dedicated teenager battled to become well enough to sit his GCSEs in May but was rushed back to hospital after collapsing just minutes after starting the first exam. The school agreed to award Ryan, who wants to study psychology and sociology at A-Level, his GCSEs based on his mock exam results and predicted grades. But when he went to school on August 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill. He walked home and returned with his fuming mother Deborah Harris, 44, who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation. She said: 'Settling a \u00a35 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital. 'He struggled to get to the school on that day but he was determined to collect his results with his friends. 'But he was humiliated in front of all his mates and this is the last thing he needed. Family: Ryan supported by his brothers Ross Took , 21 (left), and Toby Swinburn, 11 (right) 'I was also worried about his blood pressure because that can be high because of his illness. 'I thought they should at least show the lad a bit of compassion after what he has been through. 'I think it is disgusting how they treated him - it wasn\u2019t even some random receptionist - it was his head of year who knew fully well what he had been through. 'I was told it was school policy. 'I explained how ill Ryan had been and felt she showed no compassion for my child. 'The whole situation was ludicrous - it was totally ridiculous. 'He really wants to go to college now, he really is a determined little thing and he\u2019s had a rough ride.' A teacher finally handed over the results after Deborah agreed she would settle the canteen bill. Ryan achieved five Grade C GCSEs in Key Skills, English, Drama and Music, is now planning to study psychology and sociology at college. The school was unavailable for comment today but a spokeswoman for Warwickshire County Council said it was a 'common policy' for schools to withhold exam results from pupils with outstanding bills or fines."}]}

The families of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were found shot to death in Boston two years ago filed the wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court. Each seeks $6 million from the former New England Patriots player. The men were sitting in an SUV in the city's South End in July 2012 when another SUV pulled up and someone inside opened fire. Scroll Down for Video . Wrongful death: Aaron Hernandez, pictured in September, 2013, has been hit with wrongful death lawsuits for two shooting 2012 deaths just days after he was after he was accused of brutally beating an inmate in prison . Nobody has been criminally charged with their deaths, but Hernandez has been identified by police as a suspect. The 24-year-old Hernandez is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in the unrelated death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in North Attleborough. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez is now facing four lawsuits, including one by Lloyd's family and another by a former friend who alleges Hernandez shot him in the face. Earlier last week, the football players allegedly beat a fellow inmate while he was wearing handcuffs and could not defend himself. The former tight end has been separated from other prisoners at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts since his arrest, but on Tuesday he was allowed to walk down into a common area.

Suspect: Hernandez hasn't been criminally charged in their deaths, but he has been identified by police as a suspect. They were found shot dead in a car, pictured, in July 2012 . Although usually only one inmate is allowed into this area at any time, Hernandez encountered another inmate who began harassing him, TMZ Sports reported. Hernandez, who was not wearing handcuffs, turned on him and the man, whose hands were restrained, was unable to defend himself, according to the website. Hernandez allegedly lunged at the unnamed man and severely beat him up. 'It was very brief,' Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said of the fight. 'The officers were right there and it was stopped within seconds, maybe a minute.' Neither required medical attention after the scrap. jail staff are interviewing witnesses and reviewing surveillance video to figure out exactly what happened and determine whether disciplinary measures or even criminal charges are warranted. They are also investigating how the men came to be in the area at the same time. Hodgson said he did not know of any previous tension between the two men. 'We don't know what, if any, relationship there was or has been at any point, either here or anywhere else,' Hodgson said. Both Hernandez and the other inmate have been moved to other units until the investigation is completed."}]}

David takes on Goliath: Richard Gollin, who runs the six-bed roomed Baille na Cille guesthouse, claims that negative criticism posted about his business are false . For millions of holidaymakers, it is an online bible that helps them to pick the best hotels \u2013 and avoid the worst. But one Hebridean guest house owner claims some of the candid hotel and restaurant reviews posted by users around the world on Trip-Advisor have harmed his business. Now former college lecturer Richard Gollin is to sue the world's largest travel website in a landmark case. He claims false and negative postings on the website have driven away potential customers. Mr Gollin, who runs the six-bedroomed\u00a0 beachside Baille na Cille guest house at an idyllic spot in Uig on the west coast of Lewis, claims some of the negative criticism about his business should have been removed by TripAdvisor. He is taking on the might of the international travel guide, which is valued on the US stock exchange at more than \u00a32billion, over suspected malicious postings he says hit his income. In a David and Goliath battle, Mr Gollin, 64, has begun a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court. He believes the website is rife with inaccurate or false guest reviews. Postings include one from a guest who criticised the food and claimed visitors were under-fed. Another review included criticism of extra charges for a phone bill. Mr Gollin said: 'We are the most smallest, westerly remote guest house in Britain and we are taking on one of the largest travel guide companies. 'False criticisms': Baille na Cille has been 'hurt' by postings that Mr Gollin says should have been removed from the travel guide . 'I believe TripAdvisor is in dereliction . of duty in failing to have proper supervision of what goes on their . website. All across the country people should stand up to TripAdvisor.' Mr Gollin claims he has lost bookings as a result of negative and false postings and is seeking compensation from the US-based firm. On TripAdvisor, Mr Gollin's B&B has a mark of four stars out of five, with 41 out of 50 people rating it as 'very good' or 'excellent'. But some people have made complaints: . One user wrote: 'It is in a stunning location however the room was freezing cold and there was no hot water to have a wash.' Another wrote: 'Found the owner patronising and pompous.' Another user said: 'The dining room decor was distateful (sic) to us - filled with war memorabilia. The room was clean, but horribly ordinary.' The amount he is seeking has not been . disclosed, though \u00a33,000 is the maximum limit available under the small . claims procedure. Londoners Mr Gollin and his wife Joanna, 52, the guest house chef, came to Lewis on honeymoon in the late 1970s and later relocated permanently. Mr Gollin worked as a business studies lecturer at Lews Castle College in Stornoway before leaving to concentrate on the guest house. He said: 'Anyone can go on the TripAdvisor site and within two minutes could post a fake review about the Ritz Hotel in London, for example, without even being there \u2013 they could just make it up.' Mr Gollin said he asked TripAdvisor to remove false postings but claims the company ignored him. The negative comments posted on the reviews website referred to the meals, the age of the building, the host himself and the beds. TripAdvisor insists in court submissions it is not subject to the law in Scotland and its legal team, from its Massachusetts headquarters, has instructed Stornoway lawyer Angus Macdonald. He is asking Sheriff David Sutherland to throw the case out of court, claiming it is outwith Scottish jurisdiction. Mr Gollin was originally representing himself but has now hired lawyer Duncan Burd. Court papers were lodged yesterday but the case has been continued to a later date. TripAdvisor, owned by the Expedia travel website firm, is valued at \u00a32.3billion. Earlier this year its founder, Stephen Kaufer, defended the site, saying: 'Hotels would ring us saying, \"We've been given a terrible review, take it down\". But that's against everything we are meant to do, which is to create transparency.' Asked about Mr Gollin's case last night, a TripAdvisor spokesman said: 'We do not comment on threatened or pending litigation.'"}]}

Former disgraced New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was spotted over the weekend attending the Dartmouth reunion of his younger girlfriend Lis Smith. Smith, who is 31, graduated from the Ivy League school in 2005. According to Page Six, Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was apparently seen circulating at a frat party on Friday night too. The former New York Governor was forced to resign from his post in 2008 after spending more than $15,000 on prostitutes. He has also recently finalized a very public and bitter divorce from Silda Wall Spitzer. Public: Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer is standing by his gal pal Lis Smith. The couple were seen at a Dartmouth reunion over the weekend . The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private. Spitzer had a failed political 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller last year, masterminded by Smith. She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary. Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's Soho apartment in December. Back to school: Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was even seen circulating at a Psi Upsilon frat party on Friday . Now after spending the past few months under the radar, Smith is actively trying to restart her consulting career. She is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for president. Spitzer was introduced to his new girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub. Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987. The couple had three daughters as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Silda Wall Spitzer recently received a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of her divorce settlement. The ex-New York governor's former wife grimly stood by him when his predilection for expensive call girls came to light in 2008. She will also receive $240,000-a-year maintenance for life. The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days. Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum. The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies. Shameful: New York Governor Eliot Spitzer addresses the media with his wife Silda Wall Spitzer on March 10, 2008 following revelations that he spent $100,000 on prostitutes . Spitzer became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers. His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes. Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side. He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father ."}]}

In the worst cases, sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times, emitting UV rays too hot to ever occur on earth. Many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the Australian Outback - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by Trading Standards has revealed . Tanning salons, hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern, while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance. Now, even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators. The latest shock figures come from North Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide. The report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of UV radiation. Undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the Australian Outback. The investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot. It involved Trading Standards officers donning protective radiation suits to check UV levels. Tests carried out earlier this year in West Yorkshire found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit. Lamps in sunbeds can use a level of UV no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre, which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in Spain. However, investigations in Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds, and Calderdale revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre, a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth. Some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre, three times the legal limit and a level of UV radiation too hot ever to be found on earth . Similarly, an inspection of all the sunbeds in North Tyneside carried out in March  found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules. The average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre, with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts. Officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the Mediterranean, 0.9 watts is completely off the scale. The Trading Standards investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot . Clare Forbes, of West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department said: 'Such levels of UV radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth's surface. Not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth.' A Trading Standards officer for North Yorkshire County council said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced. Officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county. They added: 'As we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan, that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse.' Gary Lipman, Chairman of The Sunbed Association, joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe. He said: 'We welcome North Yorkshire County Council's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law. 'Our Code of Practice requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards. 'We very much hope that now these tests have been taken, the Council uses its powers to ensure compliance, so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field. 'Only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board, experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply. 'We would encourage the Council to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance. 'We would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed, seeks out a member of The Sunbed Association, where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning.'"}]}

Passport Office boss Paul Pugh offered a belated apology yesterday and admitted he had considered resigning over the shambles. Under hostile questioning from MPs, the chief executive \u2013 who is paid more \u00a3100,000-a-year \u2013 said he was 'sorry' for every case where service standards had not been met. But he denied presiding over an organisation in chaos - and insisted a backlog of around 480,000 cases was 'work in progress'. Apology: The head of the Passport Office, Paul Pugh gives evidence to Commons Home Affairs Committee at Portcullis House in London . Asked about images leaked by a whistle-blower, which showed boxes of passport applications piled up in Liverpool, Mr Pugh said the picture showed a 'well ordered, well controlled' holding area. He also defended the decision to launch a 'witch hunt' investigation to find the whistle-blower \u2013 saying anybody who had 'unauthorised contact with the media' must be identified. During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy. Last week alone, 16,500 of the 165,000 passports that were issued were sent out late. Committee chairman Keith Vaz asked: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? 'I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Grilling: During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy . Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely . recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I . would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met . our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the . customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' 'Mr . Vaz, who revealed he had been forced to personally text the Home . Secretary to sort out the case of one constituent, asked: 'We can take . that as an apology?' 'Mr Pugh, who promised not to take a bonus next year, replied: 'It is an apology.' 'Labour MP Paul Flynn asked Mr Pugh if he had considered resigning, since that was what members of the public hit by the debacle would want.' 'He said he had considered quitting but it was his responsibility to lead the Passport Office through 'tough times. Mr Pugh denied a surge in citizenship approvals to migrants, who can then apply for their first passport, was to blame for the problem. 'He also insisted the decision to stop issuing passports from Britain's embassies overseas was not to blame. However, he admitted forecasts on the impact this decision would have had proved wrong. 'Officials had predicted an extra 350,000 cases would be dealt with in Britain. In fact, the figure was likely to be closer to 400,000. 'Mr Pugh could soon be facing a new crisis, MPs were told, as union leaders threaten to order a walkout at the Passport Office. Mike Jones, Home Office group secretary at the PCS Union, said senior officials wanted up to 600 new jobs and pay rises for their members. He said that, if managers do not open negotiations, the union could ballot for industrial action. Labour MP Ian Austin warned him this would cause severe inconvenience to 'hard-working families' who deserve a summer break. Mr Pugh said a strike would be 'extremely damaging to our customers and our public.' 'He denied claims by the PCS that a reduction of around 550 in the number of staff working in the Passport Office between 2010 and 2014 was to blame'In comments likely to infuriate the union, he said that, four years ago, some staff did not have enough work to do and would spend their days 'reading books'. Mr Jones said the Passport Office had 'lost control' of the backlog.' He said that at June this year the number of applications logged as work-in-progress stood at 493,289, up from 289,892 in March. This compares to 146,586 applications in June last year and 72,586 in March 2013.' 'MPs were frustrated that Mr Pugh had failed to deliver his own detailed figures to the committee. 'They set him a deadline of Friday lunchtime to comply."}]}

Mrs Clinton - a potential presidential candidate for 2016 - made her differences with Mr Obama clear. But, though the suggestion was made, she did not go so far as to say whether different foreign policy could have prevented the rise of jihadist militants now causing chaos in Syria and Iraq. In a TV interview she said: 'We pushed very hard. But as I say in my book, I believe that Harry Truman was right, the buck stops with the president'. Scroll down for video . Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S. Clinton, who is on the fence about running for president in 2016, fielded questions moderated by CNN's Christiane Amanpour while wearing a Ralph Lauren suit . Mrs Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she joined forces with Pentagon and CIA chiefs to persuade Obama to arm rebels opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but that the White House resisted. Speaking on CNN, she said: 'It's very difficult, in retrospect, to say that would have prevented this.' The former secretary of state, senator and first lady has been offering views that differ from Obama's on foreign policy in recent months, including on issues such as Iran's nuclear program and dealings with Russian president Vladimir Putin. However, she stood by the President in another segment of the interviewing, suggesting that Mr Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of . Iraq at the end of 2011. That decision, which created a power vacuum in the country, has also contributed to the rise of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) militants. 'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,' she said. Mrs Clinton was referring to the two governments' failure to . sign a mutual Status of Forces Agreement, a document that would have kept . American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011. Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a . U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops . who broke local laws. ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011 . Iraq has descended into chaos in recent weeks, with ISIS seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of Iraqi soldiers. The group aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' \u2013 a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries \u2013 held together by strict Shariah law. The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Mr Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes. The White House said Monday that Mr Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting. On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city. Much of their advance has come with the help of American arms, tanks, rockets and other war materiel, seized as Iraqi army regulars and reserves fled. Pushback: Iraqi Shiite volunteers are now fighting against jihadi militants near Baghdad, hoping to stop ISIS from capturing more of their country . The quick march: ISIS has already captured the red-shaded areas in this map of Iraq and surrounding countries . Mrs Clinton entered the stage for the event, moderated by CNN's . Christiane Amanpour, to wild applause and an extended . ovation. Commenting on Monday's capture of Abu Khattalah, an accused . ringleader of the 2012 attack on America's diplomatic station in . Benghazi, Libya, she said she was 'very pleased.' 'This is another indication ... that the United States has . an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for . attacks on Americans,' Mrs Clinton said. And commenting on the nearly two years that have passed, in . which Khattalah openly operated in Libya and gave media interviews while . wipping strawberry frappes in cafes, she insisted that no one in the federal . government slow-walked the Benghazi investigation. 'It took more than ten years to being Osama Bin Laden to . Justice,' Mrs Clinton said. Mrs Clinton gave prominent mention to a State Department . Accountability Review Board report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing . related to the Benghazi facilities' lack of security on the eleventh . anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks. That investigation, however, has come under fire for failing . to interview Mrs Clinton. She said she feels the pain of the mothers and family . members of the four Americans who died in the Benghazi conflagration, caused by . the Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah. 'I can see why she and others are inconsolable,' Mrs Clinton . said. But 'we need to be in dangerous places ... We're doing the . best we can to find out what happened. There's a lot we don\u2019t know'. 'Now that we have Khattalah in custody, hopefully we will . learn more from his perspective.' The U.S. government, she assured viewers, wants to know . 'what the motivations of the leaders, of the attackers, happened to be.' Mrs Clinton has been widely criticized for claiming in the early . days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-Islam video . attacked the Benghazi compound, and not a premeditated terrorist group.

Spurs raked in a world-record \u00a386million for Bale a year ago and then wasted it on seven underwhelming signings, like \u00a325m flop Erik Lamela. To avoid the same pitfalls, Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers has already done his homework and made plans to rebuild a Liverpool team that can challenge in the Premier League and Champions League. VIDEO Scroll down for Liverpool target Lazar Markovic scoring sublime goal for Benfica . Poitning the way: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already been very busy in the market this summer . Heading for the exit: Last season's star man Luis Suarez is set to join Barcelona . Southampton\u2019s England World Cup players Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert have already arrived. So has 20-year-old defensive midfield player Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen. Even bigger fish are set to follow. Benfica winger Lazar Markovic is due for a medical on Thursday before completing his \u00a320million move from Portugal. Belgium\u2019s World Cup striker Divock Origi is in advance talks. A left back, possibly Swansea City\u2019s Ben Davies, is needed. Dejan Lovren wants to join from Southampton. The average age of the new squad will be among the youngest in the Premier League which perfectly fits the profile demanded by owner John W Henry. There will be some familiar faces. Steven Gerrard will continue as captain albeit Rodgers will not play him every week so he lasts the season. Lucas, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson will have parts to play. But overall as the washing powder commercials go, this Liverpool will be new and improved \u2013 even without Barcelona-bound Suarez. At least that is what Rodgers is counting on. Lazar quest: Benfica forward Markovic is expected to join Liverpool in a \u00a320million deal . VIDEO Liverpool set to seal double signing . \u2018NEW AND IMPROVED\u2019... HOW LIVERPOOL COULD LINE UP 2014-15 . GOALKEEPER \u2013 SIMON MIGNOLET . Made an immediate impact at Anfield last season with a match-winning penalty save on his debut against Stoke City. Now 26, he should be coming into his prime as a goalkeeper. RIGHT BACK \u2013 JON FLANAGAN . Just 21, local boy Flanagan has filled in across the defence to help the team but this could be his breakthrough season in his favoured position with Glen Johnson showing the first signs of decline. CENTRE BACK \u2013 DEJAN LOVREN . The Croatian World Cup defender has made it no secret he\u2019d like to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield from Southampton. But a fee still has to be agreed with the St Mary\u2019s club. Shoring up: Southampton's Dejan Lovren was one of the outstanding defenders in the top flight last season . CENTRE BACK \u2013 MAMADOU SAKHO . Uncomfortable first season but excelled in the World Cup for France \u2013 where he was picked ahead of Arsenal\u2019s Laurent Koscielny \u2013 and now ready to show The Kop what \u00a317m was spent on. LEFT BACK \u2013 BEN DAVIES . Rodgers has been searching for a left back ever since he arrived at the club. Liverpool have been linked with plenty but \u00a36m Davies would be right up their street if Swansea sell. CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 EMRE CAN . The German has just signed in a \u00a310m deal from Bayer Levekusen and doesn\u2019t lack confidence \u2013 agreeing to wear the No 23 shirt made famous by Jamie Carragher. Just 20, he is improving each year. Yes we Can: Liverpool have already signed Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a310m this summer . CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 STEVE GERRARD/PHILIPPE COUTINHO . Rodgers knows Gerrard can\u2019t play every week as he did last season, particularly with the club also back in Europe. When he wants to go for it, the excellent Coutinho can provide genuine trickery, with Can dropping back in to Gerrard's deeper role. CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 ADAM LALLANA . Liverpool\u2019s most expensive signing of the summer so far at around \u00a325m, Lallana\u2019s ability to keep the ball moving and pick a pass means he will be essential to Rodgers\u2019 plans. RIGHT WING \u2013 RAHEEM STERLING . One of the few England players to return from the World Cup in credit. Hard to believe he\u2019s still only 19, the ultimate modern forward with pace, technique and courage on and off the ball. Sterling work: The England winger was a standout performer for the Reds last season . CENTRE FORWARD \u2013 DANIEL STURRIDGE . 35 goals in 49 games for Liverpool is an astonishing return for a player who didn\u2019t make it at Manchester City or Chelsea. Sturridge will be desperate to show he can score goals without Suarez. LEFT WING - LAZAR MARKOVIC . The 20-year-old Serbian is rated one of the best young talents in Europe and Rodgers hopes his signing from Benfica will give Liverpool a genuine threat down both flanks. Striking it rich: Sturridge (left) finished as the top flight's second highest goal scorer behind Suarez last season . SUBSTITUTES . MICHEL VORM \u2013 Rodgers wants cover for Mignolet in goal and Swansea\u2019s Dutchman Vorm is his No 1 target. GLEN JOHNSON \u2013 Not the force he once was but in a youthful squad, Johnson\u2019s experience will be vital in Europe. MARTN SKRTEL - Found it hard to adapt to the passing style being imposed by Rodgers, but he decided to stay at Anfield and was one of their most consistent performers last season. JOE ALLEN \u2013 Rodgers\u2019 first signing, for \u00a315m from Swansea, the Welshman is among the most accurate passers in the Premier League and a growing influence on the pitch. Case for the defence: Johnson (left) and Skrtel (right) will still have a role to play next season . JORDAN HENDERSON \u2013 One of few Kenny Dalglish signings to survive and thrive under Rodgers. Possesses a fantastic midfield engine and is versatile. RICKIE LAMBERT \u2013 The Liverpudlian had a roundabout route to Anfield via Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton but he\u2019s happy to be back \u2018home\u2019 after a \u00a34m summer move from Southampton. DIVOCK ORIGI \u2013 One of the new stars to emerge from the World Cup, Origi\u2019s pace and trickery make him a natural replacement for Sturridge if the England man ever needs a rest.

Charities warn that deep spending cuts for councils have harmed the potential of voluntary groups to provide public services . David Cameron\u2019s Big Society is dead, leading charities declared today. The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is \u2018going nowhere\u2019. The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant. The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which represents 2,000 charities, claims reforms designed to hand power from Whitehall to communities and good causes are moving \u2018glacially slow\u2019. Criticism of government reforms comes as Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg today launch a Mid-Term Review of the coalition\u2019s progress and set out new policies for the next two and a half years. Mr Cameron had boasted that the Big Society was his \u2018great passion\u2019 but critics said it was vague and was being used as a cover for cuts to public services. Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed. Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded. In a letter to the Prime Minister, head of the ACEVO Sir Stephen Bubb claimed major changes to the way services were provided have been abandoned, leaving the Big Society 'effectively dead'. David Cameron has pushed the Big Society agenda, despite critics saying it was vague and a cover for spending cuts . \u2018As Prime Minister, you described . building a Big Society as your 'great passion' and 'central to my vision . for our country',\u2019 Sir Stephen wrote, according to The Times. \u2018You spoke eloquently of your desire to reform public services, with a significantly greater role for charities.\u2019 Potential for charities to become involved in providing public services \u2018remains largely untapped, with reforms in too many areas glacially slow\u2019, he added. \u2018The mood music across Whitehall has been that reform is off the agenda.

In an excruciating interview with Carson Daly, Chase wiped sweat from his brow and made a garbled and confused speech to the TV anchor. Scroll down for video . A plump Chevy Chase made a confused and awkward interview while at the 40th anniversary of SNL . At the height of his career, Chase was one of America's most popular comedians and a visible celebrity . Chase, whose real name is\u00a0Cornelius, rose to fame as an original member of the SNL crew in 1975 . Chase, who was part of the original Saturday Night Live crew in 1975, said: 'I left after the first year because I thought this isn't going anywhere... I liked [hosting]. I liked it. 'But I missed it more for not being a part of the cast because I left after one year, I had reasons to leave. 'I'm sorry if I'm perspiring, but I just had to run through a gauntlet. But I liked it a lot, and I still like it. I love Lorne (Michaels, the creator of the show). We're like brothers now.' Following the toe-curling chat on the red carpet, viewers on Twitter commented on the 'awkward' interview saying it was one of the most cringe-worthy things they had ever seen. They also mocked Chevy's famous catchphrase 'I'm Chevy Chase...and you're not' which he used during the Weekend Update segment of SNL. One quipped: 'He's Chevy Chase and I'm not, thank God'. Viewers watching the 40th anniversary celebrations took to Twitter to comment on the cringe-worthy chat . One viewer mocked Chase's trademark catchphrase 'I'm Chevy Chase...and you're not' in this tweet .

While the threat of Ebola is very real in Africa, the paranoia it's generated in the United States is unreal. You can count the number of documented cases in America on two hands -- and still have fingers to spare. There are eight confirmed cases. And in each one, the patient was either infected in Liberia or Sierra Leone, or had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian returnee who's the sole fatality of the disease in the U.S. Health care professionals, both within the government and those with little reason to parrot a party line, insist that the chances of any of us catching the virus are minuscule. If we really need something to worry about, they say, worry about getting your flu shots. From 1976 through 2007, flu-related causes killed between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the U.S. And yet, the disproportionate hysteria over Ebola multiplies contagiously. Mel Robbins, a CNN commentator and legal analyst, has given it a name: Fear-bola. \"Fear-bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking,\" she says. \"It starts with a low-grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the United States.\" Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . How bad is it? So bad that nearly two thirds of those queried in a Washington Post/ABC News poll said they're concerned about an epidemic in the U.S. So bad that the Centers for Disease Control, in the first week of October, fielded 800 calls from concerned Americans. So bad that even after a Dallas lab worker -- who isolated herself in her cabin during a Carnival Cruise because she may have possibly handled Duncan's clinical specimen -- was cleared, the Moore, Oklahoma, Public Schools asked students and faculty who were on the same cruise not to come to school. Here are some more examples of our overreaction: . From Nigeria? Not this year . Navarro College, a two-year college about 60 miles from Dallas, sent out rejection letters to some applicants from Nigeria because the country had a few Ebola cases. \"With sincere regret, I must report that Navarro College is not able to offer you acceptance for the Spring 2015 term,\" the letter read. \"Unfortunately, Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.\" The college called it \"the responsible thing to do.\" \"At this time, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to postpone our recruitment in those nations that the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. State Department have identified as at risk.\" Incidentally, Nigeria had 19 cases, but none in the last 43 days. In fact, the World Health Organization declared it Ebola-free on Monday. Who shouts 'Ebola' on a plane? Get sick in a parking lot, force a shutdown . A woman boarded a shuttle bus in a Pentagon parking lot Thursday, got off and vomited. A hazmat team responded, the area was cordoned off, military officials going to a Marine Corps ceremony were temporarily quarantined, the woman was put into isolation. A Pentagon spokesman said it was \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The woman didn't have Ebola. Get sick on a plane, stay in the bathroom . A passenger who vomited in the aisle of an American Airlines plane from Dallas to Chicago was allegedly told to stay in the lavatory for the rest of the flight. \"They told her to stay in the bathroom, and she stayed in the bathroom,\" Martha Selby, a University of Texas professor who was on the flight, told the Houston Chronicle. \"They said, 'We can't let you out.'\" The airlines told the paper that the woman wanted to stay in the bathroom, and that \"there were no concerns related to Ebola.\" The woman didn't have Ebola. Go to a conference, go on leave . An elementary school teacher in Maine was put on 21 days' leave - the incubation period for Ebola -- because she went to Dallas for an education conference. While there, she stayed at a hotel about 10 miles from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where a patient died of the disease. Still, parents were concerned, and the school district said it obliged. Here's how the Portland Press Herald put it into perspective: About 5 million Americans passed through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in August, the latest month for which statistics are available. The woman, of course, didn't have Ebola. What's more contagious than Ebola? Concern about its spread . Go to a funeral, go on vacation . A middle school principal in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, who went to his brother's funeral in Africa is now on a weeklong paid vacation. Why? Because parents pulled their kids out of school Friday once they learned of the trip. And where in Africa did the principal go? Zambia, which has reported a total of zero Ebola cases. The principal didn't have ... you know the rest. Don't like the team, taunt the player . A West African high school soccer player in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, was taunted with chants of \"Ebola\" by players of the opposing team during a game earlier this month. The opposing team's head coach and assistant coach resigned the next day. The player ... so on and so forth. What's more disturbing than Ebola? The outrageous commentary . Yell 'Ebola,' trigger panic . Last week, a masked man in a Los Angeles public bus yelled, \"Don't mess with me, I have Ebola!\" The bus driver was quarantined and the bus taken out of service. The man disappeared. But officials doubt he has Ebola. Pat down = paid leave . A TSA agent at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is now on paid administrative leave because he/she pat down Amber Vinson. She's one of the nurses who contracted Ebola after treating Duncan. And before her illness was apparent, she took a Frontier Airlines flight to Cleveland, then a flight back to Dallas. The agent wore gloves during the pat down, the TSA told Newsnet5 in Cleveland. And yet, the leave was \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Never mind that Ebola is only spread through direct contact with blood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen and saliva. And the uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin that would allow entry of the virus. The agent hasn't shown signs of Ebola. Game the system, stoke hysteria . A newly booked inmate in the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas hit on a novel way to be spared the gen pop: Tell the guards you just got back from Africa and you're experiencing Ebola-like symptoms. He was taken away from other inmates to a hospital, the staff put on protective gear, the area was decontaminated, CNN affiliate News 3 reported Sunday. Turns out, the guy not only didn't have Ebola, he's never been out of the U.S., let alone to Africa. ------ . The examples go on and on, and each new day brings a couple of fresh ones. And with flu season coming up -- with its symptoms of fever, ache and fatigue that are very similar to Ebola's -- expect the hysteria to ramp up. \"All we've known of Ebola is that it's some exotic disease in a faraway land that kills people in a very gruesome way. That's all we knew about it -- most Americans did -- until a couple of months ago,\" says CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"So, it's going to take some time to reset some of that thinking.\" Until then, perhaps we'll all benefit from this handy quiz: . ."}]}

Verlon and Dupont \"were abducted by four men aboard a Toyota,\" Kidal Gov. Adama Kamissoko said while in Bamako, according to France Info. Kidal was one of the strongholds of the Islamic militant Tuareg uprising last year that plunged Mali into chaos after a military-led coup. Following the coup, the al Qaeda-linked Tuareg rebels occupied the northern half of the country. Earlier this year, as part of France's intervention to flush out Islamist militants in Mali, the French military secured the area around Kidal, the last major town that was under rebel control in northern Mali. The two reporters were abducted in front of the home a member of the Tuareg rebels' National Movement of a Liberation of Azawad, RFI reported. The two journalists could be heard resisting their abduction, according to their driver, who was forced by the gunmen to lay on the ground, RFI said. French President Francois Hollande condemned the killings, calling them \"despicable,\" according to a statement released by the presidential palace. The kidnapping and deaths come the same week that four long-held French hostages were released.

A council boss who earned more than the Prime Minister has left her job with a \u00a3219,000 pay-off after being accused of bullying and claiming excessive expenses. Andrea Hill, chief executive of Suffolk County Council, has quit the local authority after three years of controversy. She repeatedly defied calls from the Government to take a 10 per cent pay cut \u2013 even though she earned around \u00a375,000 more than David Cameron\u2019s salary of \u00a3142,500. Suffolk County Council chief executive Andrea Hill had been on paid leave since Easter but has stepped down . The 47-year-old also faced criticism over her \u2018domineering management style\u2019. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said Mrs Hill had left the council following \u2018lengthy\u2019 talks. The news was immediately welcomed by one of her leading council critics, Kathy Pollard, who said: \u2018There will be a feeling of immense relief across the county. \u2018It has been a very unhappy chapter in Suffolk\u2019s history especially for those of us who voted against her appointment in the first place. \u2018She introduced cuts but her position became more and more tenuous as she refused to take a pay cut herself - she was obviously not willing to share the pain with the rest of us.\u2019 \u2018It is no secret that the public were very angry about her salary and hopefully there will be full transparency when her successor is appointed with clear salary guidelines - which was not the case with Mrs Hill.\u2019 Today\u2019s announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of the council\u2019s dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit. In a statement today, a spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: 'Following a lengthy discussion last Friday, and negotiations between representatives of both parties over the weekend, the county council can now confirm that Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect.' Today's announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of Suffolk County Council's dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit . An independent inquiry was launched into both the accusations of bullying and excessive expenses claims. The council\u2019s dismissal and appeals committee met to discuss its conclusions. The spokesman added: \u2018Bullying and . harassment allegations were robustly investigated. Although it remains a . concern that such a perception existed, the committee is satisfied that . there was no evidence to support those claims.\u2019 March 31: Suffolk . County Council confirms Graham Dixon, director of resource management, . and Eric Whitfield, monitoring officer, have left the council. David .

The council's discipline and appeals committee meets behind closed . doors. The meeting is believed to have discussed the outcome of a report . prepared by independent investigators from law firm Wragge and Co. July 1: The discipline and appeals committee meets once more. July 4: Suffolk County Council confirms Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect. Regarding her expenses claims, the . committee admitted \u2018there were undoubtedly claims which, in the current . climate, might not represent best use of public money\u2019. But it \u2018accepted that there was no dishonesty\u2019. Two senior long-serving council officers resigned suddenly earlier this year, which was followed by the apparent suicide of the head of legal services, David White, who had worked for the council for more than 20 years. An anonymous whistle-blower complained to councillors about Mrs Hill\u2019s management style which led to a detailed investigation by a leading London law firm whose report was considered before today\u2019s crunch meeting. Mrs Hill had come to Suffolk from a similar job as head of Bedford county council. But a little over three years later, under intense fire for her official life style - thousands of pounds of ratepayers\u2019 money spent on \u2018vanity\u2019 portrait photographs, nights in luxury hotels and expensive \u2018team building\u2019 lessons - her reign is over. A legal inquiry into claims by a whistleblower about Mrs Hill - which has cost thousands of pounds - formally ended last Friday when the council\u2019s dismissals appeals committee met for five hours to consider its conclusions. After weeks of negotiating between lawyers behind closed doors, the authority has agreed that Mrs Hill will leave - in her handbag a settlement agreement totalling \u00a3218,592. She has been on extended leave since Easter at the Cambridgeshire home she shares with her husband Philip and their three children and will now be able to spend more time with her family. Before she went on leave Mrs Hill circulated an extraordinary 1,800-word defence to council employees claiming her critics were motivated by envy and that she should be seen as a \u2018role model\u2019. Instead, she said, she had been attacked by the media and political opponents, her children had been bullied, her friends pestered and her staff abused. She also alleged that some websites called for people to carry out \u2018extreme acts of violence\u2019 against her. But there\u2019s no triumphant legacy for Mrs Hill either - her controversial \u2018New Strategic Direction\u2019 policy lies in tatters. The new council chairman, Mark Bee, moved swiftly last month with a promise to scrap large parts of its plan to hive-off services such as libraries, recycling and school crossing patrols. But it was Mrs Hill\u2019s six-figure salary which placed her among the highest-rewarded council chiefs in the country that angered many ratepayers. Not only because it was awarded without the proper procedure, according to critics, but because it was topped up a payment of some \u00a350,000 a year \u2018deferred pay\u2019 put into Mrs Hill\u2019s pension pot. By contrast the man she took over from, Mike More, had earlier announced he was giving up a \u00a336,000 performance-related bonus, seemingly happy with his \u00a3200,000 a year as chief executive of Westminster City Council. Mrs Hill stridently pointed out that she had turned down pay increases totalling \u00a3210 a week but would not consider any reduction in her current salary. In an interview with the local paper\u2019s local government reporter - who was blacklisted for exposing some of Mrs Hill\u2019s spending follies - she insisted: \u2018I do understand it is a big salary but I got the job in open competition. \u2018Anybody in the country could have applied for it - in fact many people did and they were chief executives on similar salaries to mine.\u2019 And while it didn\u2019t impress librarians or lollipop ladies who were facing the sack at the time, Mrs Hill seemed proud that she had set a good example. She said: \u2018Actually I have taken a lead on pay restraint because I decided, quite by myself, to give up a pay increase of \u00a35,000 and I gave up another increase in 2009 of over \u00a36,000 so that\u2019s \u00a311,000 I have forgone. \u2018I have considered that I have already given up two pay increases and I think that was the thing to do at the time and I won\u2019t be taking another pay cut.\u2019 What won the imperious Mrs Hill few friends was her adamant assertion that she was worth her huge salary because she was in 'a high-risk job.' It prompted one angry ratepayer to write pointing out some might consider a young Suffolk soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment fighting in Iraq on a tenth of her salary was the one in a real high-risk occupation. Mrs Hill never replied or acknowledged the letter."}]}

Armed forces in Cameroon are said to be trying to find the kidnappers, but officials have not said who was behind the abduction of Sister Gilberte and priests, Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegri. 'Doors were broken towards midnight by unknown people and the religious were taken away. We do not know where they are,' Bishop Philippe Stevens said.

Father Gianantonio had written to his home diocese last month saying local authorities had advised him to travel with a police escort, the Catholic News Agency reported.

The audit centered on the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), which was established in May 2003 by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA).

The Pentagon managed the DFI funds until the end of 2007, when its authority was withdrawn.

In a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event the bosses at Ascot introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course, employing a fleet of well-dressed fashion police to enforce the rules.

The Office of Inspector General confirms to CNN that it has staff investigators on the ground in San Antonio looking into the allegations. The allegations surrounding this Texas VA hospital comes as the federal department fends off claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix that was first reported by CNN. Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. Yet Brian Turner, a Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk based in San Antonio, said Thursday that some who called to make appointments at his facility did end up waiting longer, yet such delays were never reported. For example, he said, they might be told the next available appointment wasn't for several months. It would be scheduled for then, but marked in official files as if the patient had put off their appointment until then by choice. \"What we've been instructed was that -- they are not saying fudged, there is no secret wait list -- but what they've done is come out and just say 'zero out that date,' \" Turner said. The \"zero,\" in this case, suggests the patient didn't have to wait at all. \"It could be three months and look like no days (wait),\" he added. \"It looked like they had scheduled the appointment and got exactly what they wanted.\" The Veterans Affairs public affairs office said that Turner's allegation has been looked into, without any finding of wrongdoing. \"Based on our internal fact-finding conducted April 25-28, we found the claims by this employee were not substantiated,\" the VA statement said. However, the Office of Inspector General says it is conducting its own investigation. Turner tells CNN he has already been interviewed by OIG staff. The claim comes amid strong public pressure on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its leader, Eric Shinseki, after CNN reporting unveiled e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. Shinseki has ordered a \"face-to-face audit\" at VA clinics, a department spokesman said on Thursday. Earlier the same day, a House committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of such accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care. Shinseki orders 'face-to-face audit' at clinics . Turner told CNN that he's become a witness in an investigation by the VA inspector general's office focusing on delayed care, alleged falsification of records and possible medical harm to veterans at the San Antonio facility. Turner, a former Army soldier himself who still works at the VA, said he has asked to be protected under federal whistle-blower laws. As to the VA's earlier fact-finding efforts, Turner said that no one asked him about his allegations. In fact, he said, when he began expressing his concerns to other staff members, he was called in and told not to e-mail another person. \"They shut me up the very next day,\" Turner said.

Three children of murderer Melanie Smith have revealed the torture they suffered at their mother's hands growing up. Lisa, Charlotte and Jonathon have spoken for the first time about their mother who they describe as the most evil woman in Britain after she was convicted last week of burning five people to death. They revealed how Smith burned them with cigarettes, poured boiling water over them and locked them in a tiny cupboard if they cried. She also chopped off their hair if they made 'too much noise'. Their father Paul, now 51, fought Smith for custody of the children but lost. It was only when she abandoned them in voluntary foster care that he won them back and their ordeal ended. Devastated: Lisa and Charlotte, pictured with their father Paul, have spoken for the first about the abuse they suffered at the hands of their mother Melanie Smith . Jobless Smith was yesterday convicted by a 10-2 majority of five counts of murder, making her one of the most prolific murderesses in modern British history. Smith set fire to a baby's pushchair because she was fed up with it being outside her front door. But the blaze spread into a devastating . inferno which ripped through the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North . Wales, last October. Guilty: Melanie Smith has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home . It trapped and killed Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers\u2019s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two. Smith will be sentenced next month. Her daughter Charlotte, now 23, told the Sunday Mirror: 'We all wish she was dead. Knowing that the evil woman who killed that poor family is our mother is almost impossible to bear. Dad rescued us from hell. He\u2019s brought us all up without her but now she\u2019s back in our lives in the most horrific way imaginable. She\u2019s been dead to us since we were tiny. Now I just want her to rot in hell.' Paul married Melanie in August 1987, two years after they met at Pontins near Prestatyn where she worked as a chamber maid. She gave birth to their three children - Lisa, now 24, Charlotte, 23, and Jonathon, now 22, within the next four years but Paul said he immediately noticed she lacked any maternal instinct. As she began to drink more and more, Paul began to notice marks on the children but Melanie always had an excuse. The final straw came when he discovered her in bed with another man while their three children were locked in another room. Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell, right, with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth . Tragic: Skye Allen, two, and her brother Bailey , four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in Prestatyn . Deaths: Ms Shiers, left, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze set by Smith . The couple divorced and Melanie won custody of the children but put them in care a day later because she couldn't cope. Paul told the newspaper: 'When I picked the kids up from the foster home that day, I vowed that Melanie would never hurt them again. None of us ever saw or spoke to her again. She\u2019s never sent one birthday or Christmas card and there\u2019s never been a single letter.' The next time Paul and his children saw Melanie was when her photo appeared on TV following her arrest over the blaze. Paul added: 'Her cruelty has finally got her what she deserves. We just feel so sad for the victims and their families.' Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year . Innocent: Bailey and Skye were staying with their aunt, Ms Shiers, at the time of the killing . Relief: The children's parents celebrated after the guilty verdict was delivered ."}]}

Another police officer is suing the force after spraining their left foot when their heel became caught in a gate as they left a car park. The claim has not yet been settled. Mark Spencer, Conservative MP for . Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said the figures were evidence that a 'compensation . culture' has spread to the force. He said: 'We have lost the plot in terms of what we think it is acceptable to claim for. 'We are inundated with ambulance-chasing adverts on TV for no-win no-fee services. 'If you slip on ice while you are at home you are a dozy twit - if you do it at work all of a sudden it's someone else's fault.' Retired policeman Ray Egan, 75, . yesterday criticised the payouts and said he was 'surprised' officers . had become part of a compensation culture 'sweeping the nation'. Mr Egan, who served with West . Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, said: 'It's all to do with this claim . culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon. I don't know where it is going end. 'I'm surprised the blame culture has . spread to the police force. But everybody else is jumping on board, so . it's just human nature. 'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use. 'It's crazy really. What we need back is the man on the beat, it's become an endangered species. 'They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.' In total \u00a3446,999 has been paid out by the Nottinghamshire Police to injured officers and civilian staff. Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, added: 'The force need to take a firm but fair line on this. 'Police officers when they join know . they are taking on a demanding and dangerous role and know getting . injured is a real possibility. 'But at the same time if the force has been negligent we need to satisfy that and pay a fair degree of compensation.' But Phil Matthews, chairman of . the Nottinghamshire branch of the Police Federation, defended the right . of officers to make claims. He said: 'You do not get thousands of . pounds because you have tripped over something - you get it because you . have suffered a serious injury. 'If you went to any other organisation . that employed about 4,000 people over a number of sites and asked them . how many claims had they had, I think we could fair quite well. 'This information does not give the details of what can be nasty, life-changing injuries. Our members should have the same rights as anyone in any other organisation.' Meanwhile figures reveal the Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from officers and staff between January 2010 and March this year. Of those, 16 claims have been successful . and ten were rejected. The others are still ongoing. Although most . claims had been brought by officers, some had been made by civilian . members of staff. Dangerous job: Nottinghamshire Police has also made six payouts - including one \u00a317,826 settlement - to officers who have been bitten by the force's own dogs (stock image) John Blanchard, chair of the Humberside . Police Federation, added most officers are reasonable and will not claim . for compensation unless it is necessary. He said: 'Officers are entitled to the same protection as any other member of the public when it comes to injury. 'If compensation is due, compensation is due. By the same token, I expect a level of common sense and reason. 'There is absolutely an element of risk . in policing. The vast majority of officers will have had bumps, knocks, . scrapes and all kinds of injuries and it won't have crossed their minds . to claim. 'It is part of the rough and tumble of the job.' Most officers will seek advice from the Police Federation, which runs its own claim line for officers. Mr Blanchard said all cases are reviewed and evaluated by an independent solicitor to assess whether they will be successful. He said: 'The force's insurers are very thorough and don't pay out unless there is some fault there. 'We will have people come to us and, if we don't think they will be successful, we will give them a reality check. 'At the end of the day, it is our members' money and taxpayers' money that will be paid out.' Statistics: Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from staff between January 2010 and March this year - with 16 claims successful, 10 rejected and the rest ongoing . However, Mr Blanchard said such claims can improve safety for other officers. He continued: 'If officers have been injured, money doesn't make it all better. It is about providing some comfort, or . medical appliances that are needed, and it is also about demonstrating . to the force that the right health and safety measures were not in place . and they can correct them.' Malcolm Turner, deputy head of Nottinghamshire Police . legal services, said the force reviewed outstanding claims every month - . with checks made by the Deputy Chief Constable. He said: 'While some incidents may . apparently seem to be trivial, the consequences which might flow from . them can, on occasion, be very significant. 'Claims are handled in-house and all are . carefully scrutinised to ensure compensation is only paid in cases . where that is appropriate and the amounts paid are in line with the . guidance issued by the Judicial College.' The figures have been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, which argued it included 'trivial claims', such as an officer receiving \u00a31,200 for sprains after a strap broke on some portable equipment. Andrew Allison, spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance in East Yorkshire, said: 'There appears to be no doubt that the compensation culture in Britain is out of hand. 'Police officers should not be pursuing trivial claims such as when a strap breaks on equipment. 'Accidents like these happen every day. They should be leading by example and remember that taxpayers are picking up the bill.' The details of the compensation claims were revealed following a request by The Hull Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act. The response does not reveal whether the injuries were sustained while officers were responding to call-outs or whether they were on force property."}]}

NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope has discovered 11 new planetary systems hosting 26 confirmed planets. It's the latest find from a two-year space scan, and brings the total to 60 confirmed planets. The new haul triples the number of multi-planet solar systems found by Kepler. Doug Hudgins, a Kepler scientist at Nasa says, 'In just two years staring at a patch of sky not much bigger than your fist, Kepler has discovered more than 60 planets. Our galaxy is positively loaded with . planets of all sizes and orbits.' Diagrams of the multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler space telescope: The planets range in size from 1.5 times the size of Earth to ones bigger than the gas giant Jupiter . The planets orbit close to their host stars and range in size from 1.5 times the radius of Earth to larger than Jupiter. Fifteen are between Earth and Neptune in size. Further observations will be required to determine which are rocky like Earth and which have thick gaseous atmospheres like Neptune. All the new planets are closer to their host star than Venus is to our Sun. Kepler-33, a star that is older and more . massive than our Sun, had the most planets. The system hosts five . planets, ranging in size from 1.5 to 5 times that of Earth. 'Prior to the Kepler mission, we knew of perhaps 500 exoplanets across the whole sky,' said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Kepler identifies planet candidates by repeatedly measuring the change in brightness of stars to detect when a planet passes in front of the star. That passage casts a small shadow toward Earth and the Kepler spacecraft. The planets were detected by monitoring changes in brightness as they orbit in front of their stars. Scientists will now try to establish whether they are rocky, like earth, or gaseous, like Neptune . Each of the new confirmed planetary systems contains two to five closely spaced transiting planets. In tightly packed planetary systems, the gravitational pull of the planets on each other causes some planets to accelerate and some to decelerate along their orbits. Kepler detects this effect by measuring the changes, or so-called Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).Planetary systems with TTVs can be verified without requiring extensive ground-based observations, accelerating confirmation of planet candidates. The TTV detection technique also increases Kepler\u2019s ability to confirm planetary systems around fainter and more distant stars.Five of the systems (Kepler-25, Kepler-27, Kepler-30, Kepler-31 and Kepler-33) contain a pair of planets where the inner planet orbits the star twice during each orbit of the outer planet. Four of the systems (Kepler-23, Kepler-24, Kepler-28 and Kepler-32) contain a pairing where the outer planet circles the star twice for every three times the inner planet orbits its star. The properties of a star provide clues for planet detection. The decrease in the star\u2019s brightness and duration of a planet transit, combined with the properties of its host star, present a recognizable signature. When astronomers detect planet candidates that exhibit similar signatures around the same star, the likelihood of any of these planet candidates being a false positive is very low.'The approach used to verify the Kepler-33 planets shows the overall reliability is quite high,' said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author of the paper on Kepler-33. These discoveries are published in four different papers in the Astrophysical Journal and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."}]}

The skater-turned-Olympic commentator met men on Grindr, a gay social network that shows men if they are near other members, and sent them full-front naked selfies, according to Radar. The images and messages are just the latest revelations in a messy divorce case between 29-year-old Weir and his husband of two years, lawyer Victor Voronov. In messages reportedly obtained by Radar, a man who identified himself as Weir asked another Grindr member if he lives nearby, although the location is not known. Scroll down for video . Bitter battle: Johny Weir, right, and his husband of two years, Victor Voronov, left, are divorcing - and amid the split it has been claimed that Weir messaged other men through gay social network, Grindr . Weir allegedly told him: 'I'm a figure skater. We have a show here\u2026 What are you looking for here.' The man, who has not been identified, responded: 'Cool. You must have strong legs.' Weir also reportedly sent an image showing his reflection in a mirror. Voronov has also claimed he has an image showing his ex's penis, Radar reported - but Weir has previously said he is not worried about such images surfacing. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he told Access Hollywood last month. Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics. Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him . Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him . The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So on Monday, Victor filed a police . report with cops in Rutherford, New Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal trouble if the judge finds . him in contempt for violating terms of the temporary restraining order.' Exes: Voronov has claimed that Weir cheated on him throughout the relationship and said Weir recently sent him a 'hateful' email that violated a temporary restraining order he had out against his ex . Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . Voronov, 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - . including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema . hostage. In legal . documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out . of the closet and that he married him because . his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling . reality TV. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees. Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband . A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage. The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Happier times: Voronov and Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan . He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm. Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court last month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Weir announced their divorce on Twitter two weeks ago, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter shortly afterwards that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement. 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 . Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single . competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . He added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov. But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'"}]}

Evans went on: \u2018When I told Ms Primarolo on Saturday my decision, I even got a hug from her - thank you Dawn. \u2018I have had so many hugs, prayers and good wishes since May 4 and I would like to thank everyone who has shown me such compassionate consideration, my family particularly, my association, who have been marvellous, and even seasoned, crusty journalists have displayed a heart I have never before witnessed. \u2018I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true. But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley. Grateful: Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Mr Evans twice in the Commons . \u2018And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you. \u2018Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker\u2019s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope. \u2018Hope is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured I have retained that hope.\u2019 Evans said: \u2018This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year. \u2018Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.\u2019 The Ribble Valley MP added: \u2018Returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the Ribble Valley, threats to the Slaidburn doctors\u2019 surgery and cuts to rural bus services. \u2018It\u2019s the bread and butter of politics, giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments, my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me. \u2018I am proud to serve the people of the Ribble Valley and the best tribute I can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do.\u2019 Tory MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans\u2019s shoulder as he sat down after his statement. Earlier, at the start of Commons session, Mr Bercow said: \u2018I have received his resignation with sadness. I wish to thank Nigel for his three years of service to the House as deputy speaker, in which he has proved to be highly competent, fair and good-humoured. \u2018He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.\u2019 Evans will appear before magistrates in Preston on September 18. The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2004; the sexual assaults between January 1, 2009 and April 1 this year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 this year. Evans's initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been committed in Pendleton, Lancashire . Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said: \u2018Following an investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which concerns allegations of a sexual nature. \u2018After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Evans. \u2018Lancashire Constabulary has therefore been authorised to charge two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and one count of rape relating to a total of seven alleged victims. \u2018The decision in this case was taken by Joanne Cunliffe, an experienced specialist rape prosecutor, in consultation with John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit and in consultation with an external and highly experienced criminal QC. \u2018I have also been consulted on this case. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.\u2019 Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an MP. He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was \u2018\u2019tired of living a lie\u2019\u2019. He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.

Sacked: Paul Kellerman lost his job as a delivery driver after being wrongly recorded doing 103 mph when he was only driving at 34 mph . A delivery driver who was wrongly recorded speeding at 103 mph has been sacked despite the police apologising for the blunder and his van being unable to go above 70 mph. Paul Kellerman, 43, was dismissed after his firm received a prosecution notice stating he was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone, when he had actually been travelling at just 34 mph . The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job. He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans. Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph. 'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.' His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake. A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.' The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled. The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice. Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for \u00a3320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough. He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.' Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent. Error: Mr Kellerman was travelling at just 34 mph when he was flashed by the speed camera (library image) He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work. It's not him I'm mad at it is the police. 'I know everyone makes mistakes but not on that scale. If I'd not got a letter of apology nobody would believe me. 'I would have had to go to court and would have got an automatic ban. Other people have got to complain.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A notice of prosecution was issued in this instance in error. 'As soon as it was brought to our attention we retracted the notice and apologised to Mr Kellerman. 'We have written to him to confirm non further action will be taken in respect of the notice and have also offered to write to the company but Mr Kellerman declined this offer.

Douglas Prade walked out of the Madison Correctional Institution around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, CNN affiliate WOIO reported, a few hours after Summit County Common Pleas Judge Judy Hunter ruled he was innocent of the crime and ordered him released. County officials said they will appeal the decision. Margo Prade, a popular doctor, was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds in her vehicle in her office's parking lot in November 1997. Douglas Prade was indicted for aggravated murder the next February and convicted in September of that year. He was sentenced to life in prison. The case dominated local headlines for months and was the subject of crime shows on national TV. Although DNA tests conducted at the time were inconclusive, the main evidence against the captain was a bite mark on the victim's arm and lab coat that a prosecution expert matched to her husband's teeth. No weapon was found and prosecutors produced no one who witnessed the killing. With help from the University of Cincinnati's Innocence Project, Douglas Prade appealed the conviction and eventually won a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court in 2010 that allowed the DNA evidence to be retested using newer methods. When the results came back, none of the DNA evidence could be matched to Douglas Prade. \"The defendant has been conclusively excluded as the contributor of the male DNA on the bite mark section of the lab coat or anywhere else,\" Hunter wrote in her 26-page ruling Tuesday. Hunter also cast serious doubt on the reliability of bite-mark evidence, leaving the prosecution with little to go on. \"The DNA results prove what Prade has said all along, that he is 100% innocent,\" Carrie Woods, Prade's Innocence Project lawyer, said after a hearing last summer. \"The Court is not unsympathetic to the family members, friends and community who want to see justice for Dr. Prade,\" Hunter wrote. \"However, the evidence that the defendant presented in this case is clear and convincing. Based on the review of the conclusive Y-STR DNA test results and the evidence from the 1998 trial, the court is firmly convinced that no reasonable juror would convict the defendant for the crime of aggravated murder with a firearm.\" She ordered that Prade be released from prison \"forthwith.\" Summit County law enforcement officials were dismayed at the decision. \"This is a gross misapplication of the law, and we will be appealing Prade's exoneration,\" county Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said in a news release. \"All of the evidence clearly points to Prade as Dr. Margo Prade's killer,\" Akron Police Chief James Nice said in the same release. \"He was proven guilty in front of a jury using a substantial amount of other evidence.\" If Ohio's Ninth District Court of Appeals reverses Hunter's ruling, the state will have 30 days to file a motion seeking a new trial, Walsh's office said. \"I feel like my life is in danger and my family's life is in danger now. (Dr. Prade and her mother) are probably turning over in their graves, but God will have the final say,\" Tony Fowler, Margo Prade's nephew, told CNN affiliate WEWS. \"The decision is unfair and unjust, in my opinion,\" Tammy Fowler, a niece, told the station."}]}

Asked why, in spite of efforts by both Mexico and the United States, the leader Mexico's most powerful criminal organization -- the Sinaloa drug cartel -- remains at large, Napolitano implied it's only a matter of time before Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman falls. \"It took us 10 years to find Osama bin Laden and we found him,\" Napolitano said. \"And you know what happened there. I'm not suggesting the same thing would happen with Guzman but I am suggesting that we are persistent when it comes to wrongdoers and those who do harm in both of our countries.\" Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, and both Mexican and U.S. authorities are offering multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to his capture. Mexican reporters also asked whether the U.S. Homeland Security secretary still considers Mexico a safe destination. Twenty-two Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports Saturday while they were traveling by bus in the middle of a shore excursion near the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta. Napolitano didn't specifically address that incident, but suggested she doesn't believe there is a generalized security problem. \"I think Americans come and go freely to Mexico all the time and I expect that to continue. It's a wonderful country. There are many, many places to go and to see. And obviously we also do a tremendous amount of commerce,\" Napolitano said. The meeting with Poire was Napolitano's first stop of a five-day regional tour that will also take her to Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. Napoliticano was specifically asked whether the U.S. government is as concerned about the power of criminal organizations in Latin America as it is about terrorism. She called both terrorism and drug trafficking a global scourge, but pointed out there are important distinctions between the two. \"(Drug trafficking) has to be handled in a somewhat different way. It's a different type of crime and it's a different type of plague, but that's also why it is so important that we act not only bi-nationally, but in a regional way, to go after the supply of illegal narcotics,\" Napolitano said."}]}

Officer Regina Tasca in the Bogota Police Department, New Jersey, has been suspended since the incident last April -\u00a0 the hearing in front of a retired judge started on Tuesday. When Officer Tasca, an 11-year veteran with numerous commendations, responded to a call in April 2011, she clicked her unit dashboard camera on.

Officer Regina Tasca is seen her trying to pull one of the men off - it was this intervention which may cost her, her job . She did not realise she was about to capture a mother, screaming for police to stop punching her son outside her home on their front lawn, reported Pix 11.com. The mother - who is thought to be a councilwoman - had called emergency services to help take her son Kyle, 22, to hospital -\u00a0 he is reported to have 'emotional issues.' Officer Tasca was the only officer in the area on that day, so she called for back-up, which is part of response protocol and Ridgefield Park Police then sent the two officers. In limbo: Officer Regina Tasca in the Bogota Police Department, has been suspended since the incident last April - she is an 11-year veteran with numerous commendations . Officer Tasca said one of the officers charged at the young man and she was 'quite shocked.' 'As he's doing that, another Ridgefield Park officer flies to . the scene in his car, jumps out and starts punching him in the head,' she added. On the tape you can hear Tara, the mother, and Kyle, her son, screaming, \"Why are you punching him?\" and \"Stop punching me!\", reported the website. Kyle's mother was so disturbed by the incident that she took a photo of Officer Tasca, seemingly pulling the two officers off her son. Recorded: Photographs from the hospital documenting the bruises on the 22-year-old's head, back, arms and wrists . Kyle was not charged or arrested for an offence - Officer Tasca says this is because he did not threaten anyone and did not have a weapon. She says he was not violent and did not even attempt to resist during the incident. Officer Tasca says she was eventually successful in yanking the Ridgefield Park policeman off Kyle. 'If another officer is using . excessive force, it's my duty to make sure you stop it. and that's what I . did,' says Officer Tasca about her actions. The hospital took several photos documenting the extensive bruises on the 22-year-old's body including his head, back, arms and wrists. Disturbing: The black-and-white tape captures a mother, screaming for police to stop punching her son on their front lawn . Officer Tasca said when she met her superior officer after the incident she was asked to hand in her weapon and was told she would be sent for a fitness for duty exam. Bogota Police suspended Officer Tasca and the website reports that after hearing her story, they were concerned she was psychologically incompetent to be a police officer.

Raymond Wiss, who represented the borough in a disciplinary hearing, said Officer Tasca\u2019s termination is warranted based on two incidents in April 2011 \u2014 one at Holy Name Medical Center, in which she is accused of failing to assist a fellow officer who was attacked by a drunken woman, and the incident with the two Ridgefield Park officers."}]}

Victim: Adrianna Waller, pictured, was killed by Warner . Warner, whose execution is planned for this January, was convicted of both rape as well as first-degree murder two years after his 1997 arrest, KFOR reported. He was prosecuted by Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Lou Keel that year, as well as in 2002 and 2003, according to the affiliate station. Keel told KFOR 'Charles Warner was convicted twice by juries and given the death penalty each time and given 75 years for the sexual assault.' Keel also said of Warner 'This person doesn\u2019t deserve to live.

The number of people surviving till the age of 105 or more has almost doubled in less than a decade, official figures revealed yesterday. There are 640 Britons who have reached that grand old age or greater, compared with 350 in 2002, the Office for National Statistics, reveals. The number of 'super centenarians' \u2013 which experts classify as aged 110 or over \u2013 were\u00a0 unavailable but are also said to be rising fast. Experts predict Britain's ageing population will continue on the same trend, with more and more living far longer than their own parents or grandparents. While the extra years will be welcome to most, many will not have put aside enough to fund a long retirement or the periods of ill-health that can accompany old age. More are continuing in work after their official retirement date, with many finding that the returns on their pensions are far short of what they had expected. The majority of the 'super- elderly' are women, who normally live longer than men. Many wives survive their husbands by many years, or even decades. Of the 640 aged 105 and above in the UK in 2010 \u2013 the latest year for which figures are\u00a0 available \u2013 560 are women and 80 are men. The ONS also said the number of those who are aged 110 or more is rising 'year-on-year' in England and Wales, although\u00a0 it does not have an exact number. Many pensioners prefer to stay active in their old age and choose to go back to work . Overall, the figures, published . yesterday, show there are 12,640 people in the UK who are aged 100 or . over. This is a record and a number that is rising sharply every year . because of improved medical treatment, better nutrition and rising . living standards. William . Hunter, founder of Hunter Wealth Management, said: 'The old adage . about\u00a0 people living for \"three score years and ten\" is clearly over the . hill. 'Britons are healthier and living longer than ever before. But our finances are in much less rude health. 'As we live longer, pension companies are being forced\u00a0 to pay out for longer, and\u00a0 have of course passed those costs on.' Annuities \u2013 the income for life paid out by\u00a0 an insurance firm when you cash in your pension pot \u2013 have dropped dramatically, forcing many older people to keep on working. Nearly one million pensioners are working in Britain, the\u00a0 largest number since records began, according to official\u00a0 figures published last week by the ONS. Over the last year, the army of so-called 'grey workers' has increased by around 100,000, equal to around 270 pensioners every single day. At this level, it means nearly ten per cent of those who are\u00a0 65 and above have a job, with experts saying the number is almost guaranteed to keep on rising. For many pensioners, it is a positive choice. They enjoy their job, find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age. But many others are being forced into working \u2013 or even going back to work after retiring \u2013 because they simply cannot afford to stop. Laith Khalaf, a pensions\u00a0 analyst at the financial advisers, Hargreaves Lansdown, said the message is simple \u2013 if you want to retire young, start saving. He said: 'Living to a ripe old age is a blessing if you can afford it \u2013 but a curse if you can't. 'The Government is unwilling to pay for an ever-increasing time spent in retirement. 'Those without sufficient savings will be left at the mercy of the state pension.' Overall, the ONS said a typical man lives until the age of 85 in England and Wales, while a woman will typically survive until the age of 89. Since 1960, the average life span has jumped by around a decade for a man and eight years for a woman, it said."}]}

Sadie Fenton Hunt, 10, has such severe disabilities she needs to be boxed in to her bed every night to stop her crawling out and hurting herself. When her mother moved from Northumberland to Edinburgh to be near her parents earlier this year, she assumed the council would pay for the specialised piece of furniture. Sadie Fenton Hunt had to sleep surrounded by dog caging after her mother's bid for a special bed to keep her from crawling out at night and hurting herself was turned down . Ms Fenton was forced to think on her feet when the application was turned down. She used some furniture to steady the caging . But Ms Fenton was 'totally stunned' when she learned her daughter didn't meet NHS Lothian's criteria, and was forced to put dog caging around a mattress on the floor to keep Sadie safe at night. After sharing photographs of her daughter, who has a mental age of around 18 months, the mother-of-two has been contacted again by the council which has agreed to pay for a new bed. 'Sadie is severely disabled, she's in a special school and has limited ability and lots of learning needs. 'Mentally, she is the age of an 18-month-old so really she is just like a big toddler. 'We moved back to Edinburgh to be near my parents so they could help as I'm a single mother so it has been difficult. 'But I was totally stunned when I learned we couldn't get the same bed we'd had before. I was really upset'. The 41-year-old resorted to caging Sadie's mattress in to keep her from crawling out and hurting herself during the night. Sadie has a mental age of around 18 months and can seriously hurt herself if she crawls out of bed at night . A bed, similar to this one, has been paid for by Edinburgh City Council and will be delivered to Sadie immediately . 'Sadie hasn't ever been on holiday, she'd only ever slept in a bed like that. We need it, we all need to sleep - she does, I do and her brother does as well.

In response to the photograph of Sadie sleeping on the floor, Edinburgh City Council said it would pay for the child to get a new bed.

They were. The two had dated briefly in the 1980s. But Boatwright doesn't remember any of that. The 61-year-old Florida-born U.S. Navy vet woke up in a California hospital earlier this year speaking only Swedish. He had lived in Sweden off and on for about 20 years. Now, here he was at Goteborg Landvetter Airport, where that old friend, Ewa Espling, plans to help him get himself together in her country. \"I just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back,\" Boatwright said Tuesday. Boatwright has been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia, a rare psychiatric condition typically associated with a traumatic event. He says he has no memory of his past. Police found him unconscious in a Southern California Motel 6 in February. Navy vet wakes up, speaks only Swedish . Tuesday, Boatwright recalled that, waking up in the hospital this year, he looked at himself in the mirror and started crying. He didn't recognize the face looking back. When doctors tried to talk to him, he thought that his name was Johan Ek and that he was from Sweden. He didn't know why he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room. He was treated at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. The hospital discharged him to Roy's Desert Resource Center, where he has spent the past two weeks. The Riverside County Department of Mental Health bought him a one-way ticket to Gothenburg after Boatwright made it clear that he wants to live in Sweden. Boatwright said Tuesday that he is grateful for all of the help he has received. In the United States, Boatwright said, he felt like a stranger in his own country because he didn't speak the language: English. In Sweden, he feels safe and more calm and believes he'll be able to start rebuilding his life. \"I think it's the best solution for Michael, because he can't speak English,\" Espling said. \"To recover fully, I think he needs to come where he's safe and understands what's happening around him.\" Before Tuesday, Espling and Boatwright hadn't seen each other since 1984. Espling has arranged for a place for Boatwright to live in Sweden. She said she will try to assist as much as she can while he works through rebuilding his life. \"He's going to have a home as long as he needs it,\" she said. She identified Boatwright in a Swedish newspaper article this year. \"Michael asked me, 'Why are you doing this for me?' Because I know Michael would have done the same thing for me. If he had found me in the papers. This is a very nice man with a very big heart,\" Espling said. In an exclusive CNN interview this month, Boatwright said he suffers from recurring nightmares too disturbing to describe. Boatwright said he is pleased to be in Sweden and wants to start working once he gets his memory back. He hopes to become a tennis instructor because, in his view, it's the one thing he's good at. Boatwright compared his life to an empty chalkboard. \"After death, this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through,\" he said. Small pieces are starting to come back, however. Recently, a Swedish song called \"Sol, vind och vatten\" (\"Sun, Wind and Water\") popped into his head as if it were on repeat all day long. He had no idea where it came from. He doesn't recall any experiences that he and Espling shared in the 1980s, but some emotional remnants of the past remain. Asked how he feels about Espling, he said, \"I feel warm on the inside.\" Car crash leaves Australian woman with French accent . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report."}]}

Samantha Elauf was 17 when she interviewed for a 'model' position, as the company calls its sales staff, at an Abercrombie Kids store in a shopping mall in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008. She\u00a0never explicitly voiced her religious views or her need to wear a headscarf but the assistant store manager correctly assumed she was a Muslim. She impressed the assistant store manager, who then consulted a manager and explained that she thought Elauf wore the scarf for religious reasons - but the manager said the headscarf wasn't permitted even if it was worn because of Elauf's religion, according to the suit. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Samantha Elauf, pictured outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday, was turned down for a sales staff position at an Abercrombie & Fitch store in 2008 because she was wearing a headscarf . Support: Elauf is pictured with her mother Majda Elauf, left, and P. David Lopez, General Counsel of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as they leave the Supreme Court in Washington . The\u00a0headscarf, or hijab, conflicted with the company's Look Policy, a code derived from Abercrombie's focus on what it calls East Coast collegiate or preppy style. Abercrombie has said it didn't violate the law because it never got 'direct, explicit notice' from Elauf that her practice conflicted with the company's policy. At the time of the interview, the policy required employees to dress in a way that's consistent with the clothing Abercrombie sells, and it prohibited wearing headscarves or anything in black. The company has said it changed its headscarf policy as early as 2010, but the ban on black clothing remains. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on Elauf's behalf, and a jury eventually awarded her $20,000. But the federal appeals court in Denver threw out the award and concluded that Abercrombie & Fitch could not be held liable because Elauf never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves. 'Discrimination': Elauf now works in merchandising for Urban Outfitters and has a fashion blog . Fighting back: The company said Elauf never asked them to relax its policy in line with her religious practice . '[A]n applicant or employee cannot remain silent before the employer regarding the religious nature of his or her conflicting practice and need for an accommodation and still hope to prevail in a religion-accommodation case,' Abercrombie wrote in a brief. 'Abercrombie expends a great deal of effort to ensure that its target customers receive a holistically brand-based, sensory experience. To Abercrombie, a Model who violates the Look Policy by wearing inconsistent clothing inaccurately represents the brand, causes consumer confusion, fails to perform an essential function of the position, and ultimately damages the brand.' Elauf now works for Urban Outfitters and also runs a fashion blog. The case being argued Wednesday explores when an employer must take steps to accommodate the religious beliefs of a worker or job applicant. Organizations of state and local governments are supporting the company out of concerns that, if the EEOC prevails, they would be subject to more discrimination claims as large employers. Battle: Elauf is pictured outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2011. The Supreme Court is now considering her employment discrimination claim . Muslim, Christian and Jewish advocacy organizations have weighed in on Elauf's side, as have gay-rights groups. A legal brief on behalf of Orthodox Jews argues that requiring job applicants to voice the need for religion-related special treatment makes them less likely to be hired, with no reason given for the decision. Orthodox Jews who wear a skullcap, or yarmulke, or who may not work on Saturdays are routinely advised to withhold that information until after they are hired, lawyer Nathan Lewin said in his Supreme Court filing."}]}

Afghan officials have claimed that the Taliban has launched 800 attacks around Sangin in the past month. Sayed Mohammad, head of the local district council in Musa Qala said: 'From 15 days, fighting is going on. The reason is the government is weak and doesn't have heavy weapons. The police chief and district chief are still in place, but we are not sure for how long.' Abdul Bari Barakzai added: 'The fighting is still going on in three districts.

An airstrike in Asadabad, eastern Afghanistan killed 14 and injured 13 other - including civilians. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the airstrike, claiming US aircraft were responsible for the attack. The governor of Kunar province Shuja ul-Mulk Jalala said two children were among the dead. Afghan and US troops called in the jets after they came under sustained attack by Taliban elements. US military spokesman, Major Paul Greenberg, said a coalition precision strike killed one armed insurgent on Tuesday in Kunar's Dangam district. 'A second operation was conducted on the same night in Narang District, Kunar Province, and we are currently looking into the circumstances of that operation.' Afghan officials said it was often difficult to determine whether those killed in an airstrike were Taliban or civilians, particularly in areas dominated by insurgents. The Afghan government is considering signing a legal agreement allowing some NATO troops to remain in the country after combat operations end in December to train and advise local troops."}]}

A three-year-old girl may have tried to change her tiny brother\u2019s nappy just moments before he suffocated to death in his cot, an inquest heard today. The little girl was alone in the room in Witney, Oxfordshire, with six-month-old baby Feonyx Clarke before he was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head. The coroner, who would not name the girl, recorded an open verdict on the death - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs. 'Very sad and tragic': Feonyx Clarke, of Witney, Oxfordshire, was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head . Kirsty Clarke, their mother, had earlier told the hearing that her daughter - referred to in the inquest as \u2018T\u2019 - may have tried to change Feonyx in his cot in an upstairs room without her knowledge. Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours later at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. A pathologist told the inquest in Oxford that Feonyx\u2019s brain was starved of oxygen, but could not explain how this happened. The unused nappy bags which were found in Feonyx\u2019s cot had not been there when his mother checked on him 20 minutes earlier. Dr Steve Gould, a consultant paediatric pathologist, gave a cause of death as acute cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury and sudden unexpected death in infancy - which remains unexplained. \u2018There was a lack of oxygen to the tissues, including the brain,\u2019 he said. \u2018What has caused it is not something I can explain during the course of the investigation. \u2018What was found could be the cause of the collapse or just as likely the result of the collapse.\u2019 He added: \u2018It is possible (nappy bag death). I can\u2019t exclude it. It could be suffocation or it could be a naturally occurring collapse with an unknown cause, which then goes onto cause these symptoms.\u2019 Feonyx was also found to be suffering from bronchopneumonia as he had been unwell in the days leading to his death. Treatment: Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours after being found limp at John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford . Mrs Clarke, 27 - newly married to waste collector Gavin - provided a police statement following the baby\u2019s death. \u2018There were some toys at the bottom of the cot which he could not reach. He had a snuggle over him. Apart from that there was nothing in the cot,\u2019 she said. The full-time mother collected her oldest child \u2018N\u2019 from school with her father watching over Feonyx. She came back after 4pm. 'I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn\u2019t appear to breathing' Kirsty Clarke . \u2018At about 5pm \u2018T\u2019 went upstairs. She was three years old at this time and \u2018N\u2019 seven,\u2019 her statement said. 'I went up after her to see what she was doing. \u2018She got back into my bed and went straight to sleep. I checked on Feonyx. He was warm so I removed his blanket and then went back downstairs. \u2018Between about 5.20pm or 5.30pm I went back up to check on him. He was lying face down on some nappy bags. Also in the cot was a clean nappy with a bag of baby wipes. \u2018They had not been in the cot at 5pm when I had changed him. T was still in my bed. She was under my duvet, so I do not know whether she was asleep or not. I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. 'I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn\u2019t appear to breathing. I started CPR and called 999. I did CPR until paramedics arrived. They then took him to hospital.\u2019 Inquest: The coroner recorded an open verdict on the death at Oxford Coroner's Court (pictured) - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs . She said that Feonyx, born on November 8, 2012, was a \u2018bubbly and playful\u2019 child, who had only seen his health visitor and doctor for routine baby check-ups and eight-week injections. During evidence, brunette Kirsty told the hearing: \u2018He was teething and had a cold the days before and was a bit more sleepy (than normal). I remember nappy bags in the cot. \u2018I don\u2019t remember if his face was on . them. They were at the top of the cot. There were four or five loose . nappy bags. At 5pm there were no nappy bags, no wipes and no nappies (in . his cot). There was no bed in his room. T was in another room.\u2019 'It was a very sad and tragic death' Darren Salter, Oxfordshire Coroner . Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter asked her: \u2018It is possible that T may have tried perhaps to change Feonyx? That would be an explanation wouldn\u2019t it?' Mrs Clarke replied: \u2018Yes.\u2019 She said nappy bags would normally be kept on a window sill. Feonyx died at 1.18pm on May 25, 2013. Coroner Mr Salter said: \u2018All I can say is repeat what Dr Gould said. The suffocation on nappy bags is possible and can\u2019t be fully excluded, but there is no direct evidence at the post-mortem of it. \u2018The best thing for me to do is return what is called an open verdict where the evidence at the inquest doesn\u2019t fully show what the cause of death is. \u2018I think the most likely aspect of this was that it was a natural cause, but it is hard to determine what that natural cause was. It was a very sad and tragic death.\u2019 Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}]}

Catherine Southon Auctioneers are selling the snaps. She said: 'They are early photos and not publicity shots, so they have a real \"behind-the-scenes\" feel to them, which will make them appealing. 'When we first saw them we tentatively valued them at \u00a3200 to \u00a3300, but they are quite rare and early and offer an interesting snapshot that people will like. 'They should make somewhere towards the high hundreds mark and will be sold with copyright. They will appeal to people who collect rock and roll memorabilia, fans of The Who and dealers who deal in items such as these.' The photographs will be sold at the auction house at Shirley Hills in Surrey, on 15 November. Some of the photographs look as though they were taken from backstage by a cameraman peeping through the curtain . The photographs were taken in 1966, when The Who had just become recognised as an important band but had not yet made their name world famous . 'They should make somewhere towards the high hundreds mark and will be sold with copyright - they will appeal to people who collect rock and roll memorabilia, fans of The Who and dealers who deal in items such as these' 'Although they were known at the time it was actually a very small gig - they had already played bigger venues so it was good to see them with a small crowd like that' Roger Daltrey, left, and Pete Townshend, right, performing in a The Who reformation gig in 2006 .

Playing with fire: Court documents state that Blizerian, pictured second right in white shorts,\u00a0was in possession of chemicals that, when combined, create pure TNT . The incident comes just days after a model accused Blizerian of kicking her in the face at a Miami Beach nightclub. The owner of the club LIV told TMZ Tuesday that Blizerian has been banned from the establishment. But that may be just the beginning of Blizerian's legal troubles, as the woman at the center of the incident, Vanessa Castano, filed a lawsuit against him Wednesday, calling the burly Internet bad boy a 'menacing trust fund recipient,' according to the gossip site. Blizerian has drawn 5.7million followers to his Instagram account, which features countless photos of scantily clad beauties, over-the-top boozy parties, yachts, luxury cars and privates jets.

Miss Castano also said she would take legal action, and she has since made good on her promise. The self-described venture capitalist and poker player, who inherited his enormous wealth, daily uploads images of guns, naked women, wild parties cars and jets on a daily basis. Earlier this year, a video emerged of Bilzerian holding a naked teenage porn star above his head on a rooftop, then throwing her off the building into a swimming pool below, breaking her foot. Janice Griffith, then 18, later threatened to sue Bilzerian because she was left unable to work because of her injuries.

Blizerian's latest alleged victim, Vanessa Castano, explained that initially she didn't feel seriously hurt, but having watched the grainy footage from the club, she wanted to take action. She said: 'There were two girls standing next to me at the table that were fighting. People started getting shoved and I tried to separate them. 'Then Dan pushed me both off the banquette and once I fell he kicked me in the face. I wanted to file a police report and EMT checked my face I was bleeding from my eye but I felt fine and at that point I just wanted to go home. 'I really didn\u2019t see how serious it was until I watched the video for myself. I\u2019m lucky that the injuries weren\u2019t worse. I did nothing to deserve that kick to head, I am gonna go ahead pursue legal action against him.' Women and weapons: Bilzerian's social media log also features firearms and private jets .

Convictions: Jan Morales has a 40-year history of appalling crimes yet was allowed to work as a paramedic . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how the owner of a fleet of ambulances was allowed to drive vehicles and work as a paramedic \u2013 despite criminal convictions for kidnapping, assault and child pornography. The move follows serious concerns raised by a senior judge after The Mail on Sunday reported how health regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) granted the firm a licence. Jan Morales, co-owner of Staffordshire-based International Medical Assistance, has a string of convictions going back more than 40 years. Despite his history he had access to keys to the front doors of patients who might have to call for help. Now, after blasting the inadequate checks done on Morales by the CQC, the Care Standards Tribunal has referred the case to Mr Hunt. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday reported that CQC granted the registration in full knowledge of Morales\u2019s 21 child pornography\u00a0 offences, for which he was jailed in 2005. But it took the CQC until this month to stop him from working with patients, even though he was on the sex offenders\u2019 register. The MoS has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of companies have never been properly inspected. Even before Morales\u2019s firm was approved, concerns had been raised. \u2018It is clear at the time of the assessment for registration, Staffordshire Police had disclosed that Mr Morales had been convicted of offences relating to child pornography,\u2019 said tribunal judge Gillian Irving QC. \u2018We found it astonishing as the facts of this case materialised that a man with the forensic history of\u00a0 Mr Morales was able to hold the position of director in a company such as this. 'It was difficult to\u00a0 imagine anyone less suitable or appropriate.\u2019 Inquiry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how Morales was allowed to drive emergency vehicles . Observing that users of private ambulance services are \u2018some of the most vulnerable in our society\u2019, the judge worried that there is no requirement for staff to be checked through the Criminal Records Bureau. A spokesman for the CQC said: \u2018We acknowledge that we should not have registered the private ambulance provider. CQC have written to the Secretary of State to make him aware of this case.\u2019 The Department of Health said: \u2018This is clearly wrong and never should have happened. We are currently looking into tightening safeguarding measures.\u2019 Concerns: Andy Burnham . NHS bosses are increasingly using \u2018poorly trained\u2019 private ambulance crews for the most serious 999 calls as the crisis in emergency care worsens. In London the bill for using private ambulances has gone up ten-fold in two years to more than \u00a34\u2009million due to cuts and an increase in calls. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \u2018Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff.\u2019 Gary Palmer, from the GMB union, which represents paramedics, said: \u2018The training of the private crews can often be less than for an NHS ambulance.\u2019 A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \u2018The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients each year in A&E and despite the additional workload is coping well.\u2019"}]}

Eric Pickles revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down 'minimum standards', making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections . Eric Pickles has threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government\u2019s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline. The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to \u2018destroy\u2019 the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it. He revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down \u2018minimum standards\u2019, making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections. Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running\u00a0 contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance\u00a0 to demand a return to a weekly service, he said. Admitting his frustration at the lack of progress so far, Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: \u2018If people get impatient with me, so be it. They aren\u2019t as impatient as I am.\u2019 The minister, who argues weekly rubbish collections are a \u2018fundamental right\u2019, has been under increasing pressure over his repeated pledges before the election to reverse the trend towards a fortnightly service that began under Labour. But the proportion of councils operating black bag collections every other week has increased from 57 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent last year. Most councils have shunned a \u00a3250million fund set up by Mr Pickles to pay for the reintroduction of weekly services. Instead, the cash has been used to support the retention of weekly services in areas which still offer them. Mr Pickles\u2019 Department for Communities and Local Government only has authority over councils in England, where it says its efforts have slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England. File picture . In parts of Scotland and Wales, where the department has no say, some councils are even considering collecting black bag rubbish only once every three weeks. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England, with four million more still getting them from councils outside the scheme. He said he had also abolished plans for new bin taxes and changed the law to scrap unfair fines for people who do not put\u00a0 rubbish out correctly. \u2018If we hadn\u2019t done what we have, we would have virtually no weekly\u00a0 collections. We\u2019ve certainly saved six million, but it\u2019s a process,\u2019 the minister said. \u2018It was always going to be very difficult to take on the bin barons, take on the industry and stand up for what ordinary punters want.\u2019 Mr Pickles said he wanted to amend Labour\u2019s Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 to include the minimum standards. \u2018It would make it more difficult to do fortnightly collections and set out the type of collection that had to be made weekly,\u2019 he added."}]}

Man of the match: Sanchez . The match as a whole was mediocre, Arsenal operating at training pace for long stretches and Sunderland desperate to make sure they did not succumb to a second successive monstering after being embarrassed 8-0 at Southampton last week. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger naturally took the positives at the end of a week in which he celebrated his 65th birthday with a late comeback victory at Anderlecht in the Champions League. \u2018Of course I am happy because we had a difficult game on Wednesday night,\u2019 he said. \u2018I believe we were in control. Before scoring a second goal, of course you can concede a goal and drop points. We didn\u2019t do it today, we were focused. \u2018We won at Anderlecht and we won here, two and a half days later. That is never easy.\u2019 Wenger praised Sanchez for the ability and talent that allowed him to make the most of the hosts\u2019 errors. \u2018He took advantage of the mistakes they made,\u2019 Wenger said. \u2018He has a super quality, he is quick on his feet. That\u2019s why he wins many balls that normal players don\u2019t win. \u2018His transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that.\u2019 This latest reverse for Sunderland leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats. Manager Gus Poyet insisted he was heartened by the response to last week\u2019s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly. \u2018It\u2019s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment, reaction, desire and organisation compared to last week was there,\u2019 he said. \u2018But we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room.\u2019 Poyet also said his team were angry. \u2018They fought hard for the result and two actions cost us.\u2019 But he believes Sunderland\u2019s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue. \u2018We\u2019re getting paid to win games and we\u2019ve won one and need to change that,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s about character now, being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win.\u2019 Poyet made two changes to his starting line-up, bring in Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson as Jordi Gomez and Connor Wickham dropped to the bench.

Sunderland pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute, Rodwell heading wide from Will Buckley\u2019s cross. If that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from John O\u2019Shea and Rodwell, and both of those were blocked. Arsenal\u2019s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by Santi Cazorla. It was headed clear only as far as Kieran Gibbs, but he lashed wide from the edge of the area. Cazorla fed Sanchez a minute later and he also shot and missed. At the other end, Brown nodded on to O\u2019Shea, whose header was blocked. Then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when Danny Welbeck, who received the ball on the left corner of the area, switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over. Gibbs was booked for taking out Johnson, the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break, with Welbeck and Mikel Arteta among others to go into Kevin Friend\u2019s book. Welbeck was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by O\u2019Shea. Arteta\u2019s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient, for a high kick on Rodwell that might well have given him a facial injury. Arsenal went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to Brown\u2019s error in the centre circle. First, he failed to control a simple pass from a team-mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass, twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball. In doing so, he gave possession to Sanchez with nobody between the Chilean forward and the Sunderland goal. Sanchez dashed forward and chipped over Mannone. Cazorla had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left-footed shot flew wide right. On the hour, Sanchez\u2019s effort from outside the box forced a save from Mannone and then another former Arsenal man, Seb Larsson, elicited a save from Wojciech Szczesny at the other end. Jozy Altidore, on as a substitute for Rodwell, headed on target and Szczesny saved again. Sanchez rubbed Sunderland\u2019s noses in it with his late second goal when Mannone was clearly at fault. \u2018Vito has been educated at Arsenal so of course I have some sympathy,\u2019 Wenger said. \u2018He is like anyone else [at Sunderland], his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week. But he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again.\u2019 Arsenal must demonstrate their own, more clearly and more often.

During the conversation, he repeatedly told officers of his concern for his son and issued a chilling warning to them when he said: 'When it all comes out I will come back and say I told you so... you guys aren't listening.' Hamzah was found dead in his cot in September 2011 and had been there for 21 months. On the tape, he also accused Hutton of being 'bitter and twisted' and an alcoholic. 'Get a doctor to check the kid (Hamzah). I want you to check Hamzah, get a doctor to check him and check how undernourished he is and how neglected he is. 'There's something wrong with that kid.' Asked if he had taken his son to the doctor, Aftab, who said he had been with Hutton 'on and off for 22 years' and who later admitted the assault on her in court, said: 'She will not let me. I've told her time and time again, there's something wrong with him, take him to the doctors. 'I changed his nappy when she'd left him for about a day and a half because of the drink problem.I can't do anything. She's overpowering. Go and live with her and you'll see the big bad story. 'It all boils down to she's an alcoholic she won't listen to anybody. I'll report her to the social services.The authorities can't be bothered. I will get the social services involved, you aren't listening. 'So if anything else happens afterwards you guys know about it. 'This is the problem, authorities, you don't believe the right people. She's a bitter and twisted woman and there's something seriously wrong with her. 'She don't brush her teeth, she don't clean herself, she don't look after herself. She's an alcoholic.' The brother of Hamzah Khan (pictured) has told a jury how he saw the child sleeping in a buggy that stank of urine . He also confirmed police had been called to the house on eight separate occasions in the two-and-a-half years up to 2008. Detective Inspector Ian Lawrie told the court officers visited the home . in Bradford, West Yorks., after the interview. The court is due to hear . evidence from officers in relation to that visit. On trial: Amanda Hutton faces manslaughter charges after her son Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found at home 21 months after his death . Bradford Crown Court also heard evidence from Hamzah's brother, Qaiser Khan, 22, who said his sibling had 'appeared neglected', and had been sleeping in a cot which 'stank of urine'. He also claimed he had witnessed the child eating the contents of his nappy. Mr Khan told a jury at Bradford Crown Court how he went to the house between December 2008 and March 2009. He said Hamzah slept upright in a urine-soaked buggy that 'stank'. Mr Khan said his brother was left in a dirty nappy and he witnessed him eating the contents. 'Hamzah appeared neglected,' Mr Khan said. He explained to the jury: 'I was only at the house for a couple of days. The buggy smelled so bad of urine I got disinfectant and cleaned it out.' Mr Khan was also asked about a text message sent from his phone to Hutton in December 2008. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the text said: 'Watch out Monday you b****. I\u2019m going to go to the police station to report you for child neglect and abuse. Look at Hamzah.' Mr Khan said he did not remember sending it. Asked by Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, if he was exaggerating what was happening at the house because he had a bad relationship with his mother, Mr Khan said: 'I\u2019ve seen this with my own eyes.' Mr Khan told the court that when he was aged about 13, he was made to drink 'mouldy, off milk' by his mother as punishment. He said his mother would spend her days drinking. 'She would go upstairs and drink and then I wouldn\u2019t see her for most of the day,' he said. Earlier, Mr Khan refused to answer any questions when he first stepped into the witness box. But after a break he returned to court to give his evidence. Qaiser Khan, 22, was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of his mother Amanda Hutton, who denies the manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan . The prosecution has told the court Hutton starved her son to death. The defendant told police her son died after he was taken ill. Mr Meadowcroft said he was suggesting that Hutton was coping before Hamza\u2019s death. The barrister said: 'The child died tragically and it wasn\u2019t her fault. After that, she collapsed.' Mr Khan said: 'Urined buggy - was that coping? That was before 2009. 'It was quite clear she wasn\u2019t coping. She hadn\u2019t cleaned the house up and she didn\u2019t clean the nappies.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN)The future of the United States lies in North America. This is not a geographic truism, but a strategic imperative. Generations of Americans, distracted by far-flung crises, have long taken our own region for granted. This must change if the 21st century is to be an American century. The United States, Canada and Mexico are bound by a shared economic, environmental, demographic and cultural destiny. How we move forward together is key to our success. In recognition of our shared destiny, the three countries should create a North American passport that would, over time, allow their citizens to travel, work, invest, learn and innovate anywhere in North America.  Work, tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states. In the North American context, much like within the European Union, our economies and societies are far more integrated than our immigration system recognizes -- and a North American passport, much like the EU passport, would align our laws with reality. Podcast: A North American passport? Such a move would provide a dramatic break from Washington's historical negligence of its  \"near abroad,\" which stems from a rare luxury. In contrast to other major continental powers through the centuries, the United States has not had to worry much about its neighbors and devote the bulk of its military resources to protecting its borders. With no real threat next door, the United States has felt free to roam elsewhere in the world, as unconstrained and secure as if we were an island nation. Meanwhile, our neighbors bolster our prosperity.  Mexico and Canada are now the top two export markets for the United States, and two of our top three trading partners overall. Trade has exploded in the two decades since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which has created an integrated manufacturing platform and labor market. Canada, a stalwart ally that embodies the best of our shared democratic values, has long been the No. 1 source of imported oil to the United States, with Mexico usually coming second or third. The North American region has become the fastest-growing producer of oil and natural gas in the world and will surpass Saudi Arabia and OPEC within a decade or two as the global energy leader. This potential must be leveraged regionally, with cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning. Even if Washington still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states, mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the Colorado River. Mexico, an emerging powerhouse with more than 100 million people, is striving to consolidate its democratic gains and become a predominantly middle-class society. The United States has a strong stake in this effort. Mexico is the linchpin to our relations with the countries of Central and South America. The economic prosperity, education and security of Mexico's people will help determine the overall competitiveness of North America on the global stage. Moreover, Americans on this side of the Rio Grande must acknowledge the \"Mexicanness\" in the United States and treat Mexicans living here with the dignity and respect they deserve. The inception of NAFTA marked an important step toward leveraging these geographic realities for a shared North American success. NAFTA has been a boon to our growth and competitiveness. Integrated production platforms, sometimes spanning all three countries, have helped draw manufacturing back from competitors across the Pacific. But the promise of NAFTA has fallen short in a critical respect; while trade and investment have grown, the barriers to movement have remained too high for the people who help drive and stand to benefit from that growth. As evidenced by the recent political firestorm over President Obama's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation, it would take farsighted and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a North American passport. But the fact is that allowing North Americans to move more effortlessly across the borders would help alleviate our contentious domestic immigration battles. We have more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in this country because we didn't create a realistic, legal avenue for the number of Mexicans who would -- and should, given our level of integration -- come to the United States over time.  Moreover, by erecting a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult, costly and dangerous, we have interrupted the old \"circularity\" of migratory flows, trapping millions of workers on this side of the border. If we established a North American passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities, allowing people to move within our North American economy, we wouldn't need to debate whether to offer more than 10 million people U.S. citizenship.   Even a few years ago, immigration was a far more polarizing issue in states like Arizona. Now the tide is slowly changing. More Republicans are recognizing that their prior stance on immigration needs to change if they want to win over voters in the next presidential election. A North American passport would reflect the unique relationship and shared interests among our nations. In the face of growing competition from rising powers elsewhere in the world, simply taking our geography for granted and focusing our attention elsewhere is no longer a viable option."}]}

An Army sergeant has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, including in a bathroom and showers. The Army said on Wednesday that Sgt 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty, mistreatment, entering a women's bathroom without notice, and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of women who were naked or in various states of undress. The women have been notified by the Army about the matter. Accusation: An Army sergeant at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, pictured, has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women . Shocking allegations: The Army says it has notified the female cadets about the matter . McClendon, who is a combat engineer and joined the military in 1990, was assigned to the academy from 2009 to this month. He was a member of the support staff at West Point, working with cadets. He was charged on May 14 with violating four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but some of the allegations date back to 2009. He has been transferred to Fort Drum, New York. The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military, and comes on the heels of a Pentagon report that estimated that as many as 26,000 service members may have been sexually assaulted last year. 'The Army is committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of our Cadets at the Military Academy at West Point - as well as all soldiers throughout our Army,' said Gen John Campbell, vice chief of staff of the Army, in a statement. Startling trend: The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military . 'Once notified of the violation, a full investigation was launched, followed by swift action to correct the problem. Our cadets must be confident that issues such as these are handled quickly and decisively, and that our system will hold those responsible accountable.' The charges, first reported by The New York Times, detail that he took videos of various women's body parts without their consent. And the charges note that the videos have been recovered. According to the Army, McClendon was relieved of his duties on May 17, 2012, and was ordered to have no contact with cadets and was barred from entering cadet areas on the post. The yearlong delay in formally charging McClendon was because of the complexities of the case and the effort to recover the forensic evidence. McClendon, who is from Blakely, Georgia, is doing military duty at Fort Drum, and is not being held in a jail. Growing problem: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, left, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, right, have been asked by President Obama to lead a process to root out the problem of sexual abuse within the U.S. military . Army spokesman George Wright said that throughout the notification process, the Army will protect the privacy of the individuals involved as well as offer support services as required. In recent weeks, military leaders have expressed anger and shame over their failure to stem the escalating sexual abuse across the services. In a meeting last week with defense and military officials, President Obama asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey to lead a process to root out the problem. Calling it a crisis, Dempsey said the women who serve in the military are losing confidence that the problem can be solved."}]}

Controversial 'performance artist' Mr McGowan - who once performed a 'piece' in which he keyed a succession of cars, ate a dead corgi, and danced a ballet dance while dressed as a pig outside New Scotland Yard -\u00a0 has attracted a cult following on his own YouTube channel with some videos attracting more than 200,000 hits. Controversial 'performance artist' Mark McGowan has become a YouTube sensation after reinventing himself as the Artist Taxi Driver . His YouTube channel is filled iwth nearly 2,000 videos in which he can be seen ranting to the camera and interviewing controversial figures such as comedian Frankie Boyle . In them he can be seen interviewing high profile figures such as Boyle, Respect MP George Galloway, and the Oxford Cambridge boat race saboteur Trenton Oldfield, who happily tells the artist that the six months he spent in prison for his stunt were 'an amazing experience'. In the bizarre interview with Boyle, in which the comedian tells him that he believes the universe is 'conscious' and that creation is God just playing a 'game of hide and seek with himself', the taxi driver can be heard calling the\u00a0 Queen a 'hairy f*****'.

Patients offered books had significantly lower levels of depression four months later than those offered routine GP care such as antidepressants. The findings are good news in an era where non-drug forms of treatment, such as talking therapies, are hard to come by. More than 200 patients who had been . diagnosed with depression by their GP took part in the University of Glasgow study. Half of them were on antidepressant drugs and some were provided with a self-help . guide dealing with different aspects of depression, such as sleep problems. These people read the book and had support sessions. The self-help book was based on the . principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is a . well-established \u2018talking therapy\u2019 for depression. It is based on the principle that problems can be managed by changing thought process and actions. But accessing a therapist can be difficult. CBT is already recommended by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) for the treatment . of depression, either as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate . depression, or in combination with antidepressants for more severe . depression. However, as it is usually provided by specialist therapists, people in some areas may have limited access to treatment. In the study, patients who read the books also had three meetings with a support worker who went through the literature and helped the volunteers plan what changes to make. After four months those who had been . prescribed the self-help books had significantly lower levels of . depression than those who received usual GP care. After four months, those who had been prescribed the self-help books had significantly lower levels of depression than those who got usual GP care . Participants in the guided self-help CBT group also had better . knowledge of depression,\u00a0 the researchers reported in the journal Plos One. Study leader Prof Christopher Williams, who also wrote the books called Overcoming Depression and Low Mood, said the guided . sessions were crucial in the success of the books. He told the BBC that the sessions could be delivered by GPs, rather than therapists, thereby reducing the waiting lists for talking therapies. The sessions can be delivered in general practice without referral to a specialist, taking pressure off waiting lists. 'We found this had a really significant clinical impact and the findings are very encouraging,' he told the BBC. 'Depression saps people's motivation and makes it hard to believe change is possible.' The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) One."}]}

The 'Bluewater Classic' in its 70th staging is the first real competitive test for Comanche, which has been specially built for distance racing and speed record attempts, the brainchild of Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his wife, Kristy Hinze-Clark, who was born in Australia. Comanche, skippered by American Ken Read and with a strong international crew, is expected to battle it out for line honors with seven-time winner Wild Oats XI in the 628-nautical miles race, one of the highlights of the international yachting calendar. The traditional Boxing Day start from Sydney Harbor saw an early glimpse of Comanche's speed with the skipper of Wild Oats XI, Mark Richards, moved to exclaim: \"She's smoking -- look at that thing go!\" Out to sea and past the first mark in an unofficial record time, Comanche led from Wild Oats XI with the other supermaxis Ragamuffin and Perpetual Loyal giving chase. The race, which runs down the east coast of Australia and across the Bass Strait to the Tasmanian capital Hobart, has drawn a 117-strong entry, the biggest since 1994. But pre-race attention has centered on Comanche -- with its wide-bodied and cutting edge design, and two years in the building in Maine in the United States. Clark watched from a supporting boat as his wife was part of the crew when Comanche took part in the Big Boat Challenge in Sydney Harbor on December 9, won by Wild Oats XI. But the short race was just a small taster for the bigger test and Hinze-Clark opted out of competing, two days before the start, due to fears her inexperience might hamper the race favorite in predicted difficult conditions. She also has three-year-old and four-month-old children to look after so both joint owners are safely shore side to track the progress of their costly boat. \"We're ready,\" Read told the official race website before the start, unperturbed by reports of the rougher conditions ahead. \"To me it looks like a nice sailboat racing day. A little breezy, a little lumpy, but if our boat can't handle 25 knots and a little bit of bump then something's wrong.\" The weather forecast would appear to rule out the chance of a new race record, the current mark set by Wild Oats XI in 2012, of one day 18 hours 23 minutes and 12 seconds, and there were several early withdrawals in the testing conditions.

Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Michelle Obama embrace while meeting Wednesday in London. While meeting Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in London on Wednesday, the two women briefly embraced -- not your typical scene at Buckingham Palace. The British media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen. The Times of London proclaimed it a \"touching moment,\" and the palace apparently agreed. \"This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama,\" a palace spokeswoman said. CNN's Carol Costello talked about the moment Thursday with Charles Mosley, author of \"Blood Royal,\" on CNN's \"American Morning.\" CNN: According to our tabloids in the United States, the meeting went really well. What's your take? Mosley: Absolutely. What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. But the queen made the first move. This is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy-feely. Indeed, her son Prince Charles complained on one occasion that he wasn't given enough affection when he was a child. She's obviously a late developer. CNN: What's the big deal [about touching the queen]? Mosley: The big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person. In monarchies, there's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign, which is perhaps not known in republics, at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy. She's been on the throne a very, very long time, and she is herself a very dignified person, all the more so because of her relatively short stature. Watch to see if \"hugging\" the queen broke protocol \u00bb . One of the things one saw yesterday was the way [President] Obama and Michelle towered over the queen and indeed Prince Philip. CNN: By the queen putting her hand on the small of Michelle Obama's back, does that signal friendship? The queen said something to Michelle Obama toward the end of the meeting about keeping in touch. Mosley: Certainly, keeping in touch is meant quite literally. Yes, it's a very significant gesture; she's not known for this kind of thing. amFIX: Your thoughts on Michelle Obama and the queen . CNN: Let's talk about the other gesture: the gift of the iPod. Some tabloids are calling it the \"i-Dud\" in the sense that this wasn't a great present to give the queen. What do you think? Mosley: Not a bad one at all. The queen is actually quite technologically advanced. She uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son, who is a bit of a technophobe. CNN: [The queen gave the president a silver-framed photograph of herself and her husband.] Was it a recent picture of the queen and Prince Philip at least? Mosley: That I don't know. If it's the same as she gives everybody, it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years. On the other hand, it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for Michelle Obama was her way of saying, \"Sorry, I should have given you something more personal.\""}]}

Mother-of-four Angela Williams brought the infant into her bed because she 'wanted to be with him', after separating from his father. She found three-month-old Bobby Blakemore unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene. Three-month-old Bobby Blakemore was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest in Bolton heard . The Bolton hearing was told Bobby was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz, but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns. Miss Williams of Clifton, near Swinton, Greater Manchester, told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am. The company team leader said: 'I would wake up about 12 and then 3am, he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed.' On October 19 last year Bobby's father Liam Blakemore, an insurance worker, took him out before returning before 1pm. The youngster slept until 2.45pm before waking for a feed and was a 'bit sick.'\u00a0After that he was said to be fine. Bobby had another feed at 6.30pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep. That evening Miss Williams was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa. The inquest was told that Bobby did have a Moses basket but Miss Williams said: 'He didn't like sleeping in it, he had a crib in our room. 'That night I put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib. I wanted to be with him. I was playing songs he liked listening to.' Little Bobby ,pictured with his father Liam Blakemore, had been perfectly healthy before he died . She said she lay on her back and put herself between Bobby and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet. She woke at around 6am to find Bobby unresponsive . Despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator, Bobby was pronounced dead at the scene. When asked by the coroner Alan Walsh if she had been aware of any overlying Miss Williams replied 'no.' She said that when she woke Bobby was in the same position in which she had left him. The NHS advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room. They advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker, has recently drunk alcohol, taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired. They say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight. The NHS say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their baby. Or the child could get caught between the wall and the bed, or roll out of an adult bed and be injured. She also said that he hadn't cried in the night. The pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child. Recording a narrative cause of death Mr Walsh said: 'It's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death. 'Although born prematurely Bobby did grow and thrive and that's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents. 'He was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity. 'He was placed in bed with Angela because she wanted to be close to him that day. 'He usually slept in a crib, sadly he didn't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive. 'It's important that some of the factors that arise in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are given as a warning, there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death. 'Prematurity is one of the factors, co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking. I'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house. It is not right to reach any conclusion that these factors caused the SIDS. I make no comment other than that they exist and people should be aware of this.'"}]}

Ian Fleming wanted his first James Bond film to feature Mafia villains and be as fast-paced as possible to distract the audience from unlikely storylines, a previously unseen memo reveals. The message from the author, written in 1958, warned against any 'cardboard' acting and suggested the script writers should use an Italian phone directory to make the names as authentic as possible. While the Mafia did not feature in a Bond film, the plot ultimately formed the basis for the Thunderball movie, though with significant changes. No cardboard: This memo, written by Ian Fleming to Jack Whittingham in 1958, outlines the plot for a Bond film which would eventually become Thunderball . Memo: Ian Fleming, pictured, sent the suggested to playwright Jack Whittingham . Differences between the original script . and the Thunderball familiar to fans include dropping the Mafia villains . in favour of global terrorist group SPECTRE, and changing Bond's love . interest from straight-laced police investigator to a fiery, . sexually-aware young woman called Domino. He sent the page-long summary of ideas for the film - which had suggested titles of James Bond, Secret Agent, and later Longitude 78 West - to playwright Jack Whittingham, who was tasked with producing the first 007 screenplay. A secret memo in which Mr Fleming spells out his ideas for the first James Bond movie including using names from the phonebook for characters has come to light. The correspondences predates Dr No, the first Bond film to make it to cinemas, by four years. Although a final script was made for the film, it never went into production due to a legal wrangle. Along with the memo is a final edition bound script for Thunderball, which will be sold at auction in London this month. The items were held by Mr Whittingham, who died in 1972, and have now been made available by his estate. In his memo the prolific novelist outlined the plot, involving the Mafia blackmailing the British out of \u00a3100million pounds using a stolen nuclear warhead. Final cut: The script developed by Mr Fleming and Whittingham eventually became the film Thunderball, starring Sean Connery (pictured) Mr Fleming wrote: 'My concern is... to make it as fast-moving and packed with incidents as possible. To my mind the chief weakness is the thinness of the Mafia threat and this must be considerably strengthened. 'I am badly in need of good Italian names for the Mafia gangsters and these could perhaps be obtained from the Venice telephone directory! 'In order to keep the feet of this film firmly on the ground production will have to be particularly brisk so as not to allow the audience time to worry about probabilities. 'Production will have to be particularly strong in portraying the Secret Service and the Mafia. Any suspicion of cardboard must be avoided and the acting throughout should be under-played and without exaggeration. 'More subsidiary incidents should be added where there is any sign of the pace flagging but, for the time being, my invention has run out.' Novel: Mr Fleming later turned the script into a . novel (right) but did not credit Mr Whittingham or his producer, who . had helped craft it. A court case later awarded Mr Whittingham the film . rights to the book. The finished screenplay, right, is part of the . auction lot . Although the scrip was finalised, plans for the film were shelved in 1960 due to a disagreement with producer Kevin McClory. Mr Fleming went on to write Thunderball as a novel in 1961, but in doing so failed to credit Whittingham and McClory for their input. The case was settled out of court in November 1963 and McClory was awarded the film rights for Thunderball, which premiered in 1965, a year after Fleming's death. The memo along with a first draft 'continuity treatment' for Thunderball by Whittingham, and first draft shooting script for the film that are all for sale now were used as evidence in the case. Katherine Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Fleming decided in 1958 to turn one of his James Bond books into a film and this pre-dated Dr No by four years. Titles: Pages of the memo up for auction show potential titles for the film which would become Thunderball . 'The memo is Fleming's thoughts of what the film would be. He was an amazing novelist but found it difficult to convert his work to the big screen which is why he employed Whittingham. 'Fleming is saying in the memo \"let's do it like this\". One idea he had was to use the Mafia as the bad guys which is different to what was eventually made. 'But the most significant item for sale is the original final edition script because that is the script for the very first Bond movie.' The memo, Whittingham's first draft treatment and first draft shooting script are expected to sell for \u00a35,000 each. The final edition script for Thunderball is tipped to go under the hammer for \u00a312,000 in the auction in London on December 18."}]}

To listen to him talk about the national team, to hear the passion in his voice, leaves you wanting to know more. \u2018I will give myself the best opportunity of getting the job by getting all the badges,\u2019 he added. \u2018I don\u2019t think people should start shouting the odds about the opportunity to manage clubs until they have their badges. I am not sitting here saying \u201cgive me a job\u201d because I don\u2019t have them yet.\u2019 Fitting right in: Ferdinand with David Beckham and Sir Trevor Brooking on the bench in South Africa . He is on the UEFA B licence course and the next step is the A Licence and then the ProLicence. After that, he cannot be ignored. Ferdinand, who turns 36 in November, has too much to offer after a lifetime in the game. He has experienced almost everything. He admires the young coaches; the guys who were given a chance in their thirties. Ferdinand believes they have a better connection with the dressing room. \u2018Low, Klinsmann were young geezers when they started out with Germany,\u2019 he added. \u2018Look at Van Basten, Mourinho, Guardiola and Luis Enrique \u2014 they are not old fellas but they were given a chance. It is different in this country. We are 10 years behind in certain situations. We have to do what\u2019s best for English football.\u2019 Ferdinand has the bug for it. He would be a tracksuit manager, taking England\u2019s players through sessions as they prepare under a player who won 81 caps for his country during a distinguished international career. The old ones aren't always the best: A young Jose Mourinho sprints down the Old Trafford touchline in 2004 . He speaks of radical changes needed with the national set-up, adapting the structure to suit an England team that would be encouraged to play Ferdinand\u2019s way. After 50 years of failure, it has to be worth a shot. \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not their (the FA\u2019s) type, but I don\u2019t know what their type is,\u2019 added Ferdinand. \u2018Maybe it\u2019s an unblemished track record, but everybody deserves a second chance. Glenn Hoddle is a prime example. He\u2019s the best one you had and he is gone, never to be seen again with England. We are on our knees.\u2019 Ferdinand is talking about his eight-month ban from football after he missed a drugs test in 2003. It was an error, a bad one, but he has been the model professional ever since. \u2018Everybody deserves a second chance,\u2019 he says. Ferdinand is right. This is a man who wants to take care of his country, to improve the players and make sure the future of the national team is secure. It has been a long time since anyone could say that. \u2018It will take radical changes for things to happen with England and people\u2019s noses might be put out of joint but in the long run it will work,\u2019 he added. Pepping them up: Pep Guardiola ushered in an era of success at Barcelona after being appointed aged 37 . \u2018I am speaking from a position of wanting to help. When you are a young player, making your way, you don\u2019t want to speak out because you are worried you might not get picked. But when you come out of the firing line, you can speak with experience.\u2019 Ferdinand sat on FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s commission, providing some compelling arguments about the state of English football when he sat down to discuss the future of the national team. \u2018Bit left-field that one,\u2019 is his reaction to a question about Roy Hodgson\u2019s claim last week that there isn\u2019t much difference in the way England and Germany try to play. He is reluctant to answer at first, unaware of the comments after he had only just come off QPR\u2019s training pitch in west London as he prepared for the start of the Barclays Premier League season. \u2018I watched the games at the World Cup and I didn\u2019t see any likeness to Germany at all,\u2019 he added. \u2018We see sparks from Sturridge, sparks from Welbeck and from Rooney, but we play as individuals. They will not be able to fulfil their potential unless there is a structure and philosophy to aspire to.\u2019 One day Ferdinand hopes to be able to put it all in place. Lowering the age: World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low was in his thirties when he became Germany boss in 2007, as was his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann (left) He has the ideas, as well as the experience after playing career that took him to the very top. With his profile, along with his England career, the six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008, he will command instant respect in the dressing room. He fears that young players in the Premier League are earning too much, something Brendan Rodgers highlighted last week. \u2018The incentive has gone,\u2019 claimed Ferdinand. \u2018Are you gong to do that extra set of doggies, or sprints? You can be in the reserves and if you have \u00a35,000 a week coming in you\u2019re thinking about what colour car you\u2019re going to get. \u2018Or you might be thinking what holiday you\u2019re going to send your mum and dad on or what shoes you\u2019re going to get. It is a different environment and I don\u2019t think it is the right environment. It is football and if you are given a lot of scope then you will do it. That is the way it is. Maybe clubs or the FA have to revert back a little bit to give them a bit more of a grounding.\u2019 Ferdinand is a traditionalist, one of the old school as he reflects on the days when he would sit on the bench alongside Frank Lampard as a teenager at West Ham. Back then they still cleaned the first-team players\u2019 boots, keeping their head down and driving to training in beaten-up old Ford Fiestas at the start of their careers. The best: Ferdinand rates Glenn Hoddle (left), now QPR first-team coach, as his best England boss . \u2018When I got on the bench at West Ham I thought it was an unbelievable achievement,\u2019 he added. Me and Frank Lampard would sit there thinking, \u201cJesus\u201d. \u2018We would go out there to do the warm up and people think that\u2019s nothing, but it is part of the experience and gets you accustomed to the surroundings. Now those players don\u2019t get the chance. Managers won\u2019t play a 17-year-old when they can play \u201cDavide\u201d or whoever, from wherever, because he has played 300 games and is 28 years old. That\u2019s just my view, but who is right and who is wrong?\u2019 Judging by this, Ferdinand has already got it all figured out. Rio Ferdinand is an ambassador for BT Sport, who this season will show 38 Premier League matches exclusively live plus top games from the FA Cup, UEFA Europa League and live action from more top flight football leagues than any other UK TV provider.

Hospitals in Abyan and neighboring Aden are full of land mine victims,\" Ali Hadi, a resident of Zinjibar, told CNN. \"Zinjibar is still empty though, al Qaeda is nowhere to be seen. People know their lives are still at risk but this time from land mines,\" he added. Col. Saeed Ali Mishal, head of the engineering unit tasked with clearing the mines, said the government managed to clear 3,119 land mines this week from the towns of Zinjibar, Jaar, and Shuqra. \"Explosions linked to land mines are heard three to four times daily in Zinjibar,\" said Mishal. He said that the mines are all locally made and those found have been destroyed. The increasing death toll complicates government efforts to relocate locals displaced by the war. UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, reported that 150,000 people fled Abyan and are stranded in low-capacity shelters. The displaced currently occupy dozens of schools in Aden and Lahj provinces. Mohammed al-Saadi, Yemen's minister of international affairs, said one of the government's main priorities is to rebuild Abyan, after the year-long war destroyed thousands of homes.

Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has returned home to Venezuela following two months of treatment in Cuba. In three ecstatic messages posted on Twitter, Mr Chavez, 58, thanked Cuban President and ex-leader Raul and Fidel Castro. Chavez had not been seen or heard from since he went to Havana, Cuba on December 10 for treatment, in contrast to previous medical visits. But today his account said: 'We have arrived back in the land of Venezuela. Thank you Lord!! Thanks to my beloved people! We will continue our treatment here.' He also thanked Venezuelans for their support and said he would continue treatment in his home country. Pictures released by the Venezuelan government show Hugo Chavez with his daughters Rosa and Maria. The president had not been seen since he left the country to have cancer surgery in Havana, Cuba, in December . There was no information about when or why he returned, and no details about whether he would actively take up the duties of office. But he added: 'Onwards to victory!! We will live and we will overcome!!!' In photographs released last week, the . president is seen smiling and propped up on a pillow in bed, surrounded . by his two daughters Rosa and Maria. In another image, Chavez is seen reading an issue of the Cuban Communist Part newspaper Granma. The pictures were shown on state television by Chavez's son-in-law, Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza alongside new details about Chavez's condition. Government opponent have been demanding to know why Chavez hasn't spoken to the nation to explain his illness. Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the president had overcome a respiratory infection and is breathing through a tracheal tube that makes it difficult for him to speak. He said: 'After two months of a complicated post-operative process, the patient remains conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.' Chavez was also pictured looking at the Cuba Communist Party newspaper Granma, in a shot said to have been taken yesterday . Villegas also said that doctors are . 'applying vigorous treatment for his fundamental illness', in an . apparent reference to cancer. Villegas . said the Venezuelan government thanks Cuban leaders Raul and Fidel . Castro 'for the love and the care shown to our president.' He . said: 'We trust... that Comandante Chavez will overcome these delicate . circumstances sooner rather than later to accompany his nation in the . path to new victories,' finishing the statement by saying: 'Viva . Chavez!' Before leaving for . Cuba, Chavez acknowledged there were risks and said that Vice President . Nicolas Maduro should run in a new election if his cancer fight . prevented him from staying on as president. Maduro . has travelled repeatedly to Havana in recent weeks, and has shown . documents signed by Chavez on television while insisting the president . remains in charge. On . Wednesday, Maduro said that Chavez is undergoing 'extremely complex and . tough' treatments, but did not specify what they were. Medical experts told the Associated Press that the government's recent accounts of 'systemic medical treatment' could mean various types of chemotherapy or drug treatments, depending on the type of cancer. The 58-year-old president has been undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba on-and-off since June 2011. He has had tumors removed from his pelvic region, and has also undergone prior rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Throughout the treatments, Chavez has not revealed the type of cancer or the location where tumors have been removed. Since December, the government has provided regular updates, though there have been fewer updates in recent weeks, and often with only vague descriptions of Chavez's condition."}]}

The 36-year-old rapper appeared on Kris Jenner's daytime talk show \"Kris\" on Friday to discuss his relationship with Jenner's daughter, Kim Kardashian, and their new addition, North. But if Kanye was smart, he'd hire Jenner as part of his PR team. The reality TV momager, who has extended her family's brand from E! to Fox with this test run of her talk show, reiterated several times that the stone-faced and difficult Kanye portrayed in the media is not the man she's come to know. (Kanye, after all, is now living in her home.) \"I'm so excited that I've gotten to know you like I have,\" Jenner said. \"There are a lot of things that people don't know about you that are so interesting to me that I want other people to hear.\" Kanye spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook. \"To me it's such a blessing, and I feel like it's going to give me the stability that I need to really create and really do God's work in the way I should,\" Kanye, wearing a \"what would Jesus do\" bracelet, told Jenner. \"Someone to be accountable, someone to be responsible for. After I lost my mother there were times I felt like I would put my life at risk, I felt like sometimes I didn't have something to live for. Now I have two really special people to live for, a whole family to live for. I want people, when they remember me and my family, their thought association to be someone who helped, someone who brought joy.\" He did bring plenty of joy to Jenner's show, as she beamed while displaying North's photo for the audience. North, who was born June 15, has her mother's eyes and father's cheeks, according to Jenner. \"The thing I think about as a dad is just protection. That's my only goal, to Kanye said his goal is \"to protect my daughter. That's my instinct.\" \"To give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child. Of course, a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5-year-old around and screaming at them. ... You have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it, and it becomes really intense.\" According to Jenner, Kanye's been into his girlfriend for a long, long time, and would even use Photoshop to draw himself into the yearly Kardashian-Jenner Christmas card. (Seriously -- Jenner showed proof.) Although he couldn't quite remember the first time he met Kardashian, 32, Kanye did know it was love at first sight. \"I'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was Brandy's assistant, and I think she brought us in, like, something to drink,\" he said. \"Or it might've been when I was doing Brandy's video and I remember asking my manager, 'Who is that girl right there?' ... I was in love with her before I even got to talk to her.\" Kim, he said, was always someone he dreamed about being with, but more importantly, he feels that they're \"equally yoked.\" \"Being in the limelight, you have to have a match, or someone that's equally yoked,\" he told Jenner. \"It's difficult, because there's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous, or people who would want you to be less famous than you were, and just not accept who you are in life. And when I would be on the phone with her, even at my lowest moments, she'd give me energy and remind me of who I was. And I needed that support at all times.\" Kanye knows that there are those who think he and the Kardashian family wouldn't have much in common. But he's trying to grow both spiritually -- \"I'm a Christian,\" he said, \"That's what's important to me, that I grow and walk and raise my family with Christian values.\" \"People feel that me and my girlfriend's mother are of different brands in a way,\" he said. \"But it's not about any of us being at odds, it's about us helping each other and improving each other. I might be one of the only guys in the world that knows how to pick out a pair of shoes for a girl, but I have improvements that I need to make as a human being ... the way that I talk to people, being too sharp with people, or being too edgy. As a creative guy, sometimes it's hard for me to small talk. ...  And that's something that (the Kardashian) family and Kim are teaching me, helping me to be a better person.\" Given the negative press he's had -- from that infamous mic-jacking at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to more recent run-ins with the paparazzi --  does he have any regrets? Not exactly. While there are things he wishes he could change, he also believes that \"everything happened for a reason, and I've grown from it,\" he said. \"I feel that I'm very, very, very blessed, and with that comes great responsibility. With the way my parents raised me and the information that they gave me and this feeling that I have that I want to help, I think anything that could be considered a mistake will help me to make better decisions in the future.\""}]}

Thriving: Britain's soggy summer has provided perfect breeding conditions for pesky mosquitoes . Beware this Bank Holiday weekend. If the rain doesn\u2019t get you, a mosquito might. Sun-starved Britons who had their hopes of a glorious summer dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the bizarre weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations. The . current wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground . for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported . bites. There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem. In the past week alone Tesco has seen sales of the creams shoot up by 150 per cent at its pharmacies across the UK, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years. 'The recent balmy weather has led to the most concentrated demand for insect bite and sting creams we have ever seen,' said Tesco spokeswoman Joy Wickham. 'Demand has been rising through the summer and during the very muggy weather we had last weekend we saw the highest sales so far this year.' The insects won\u2019t be the only\u00a0 hazard, however. As around 1.8million Britons prepare to head abroad for the break, the Met Office is warning of heavy downpours across the country. Some areas could see as much as two inches of rain today. Forecasters issued a 24-hour severe weather alert, predicting torrential storms and gusts of winds of up to 50mph along the south coast. Things could start looking up tomorrow, however. Most of the country is expected to see a drier day with the exception of northern England where there could be some lingering showers. Temperatures are not expected to reach much higher than 20C (68F) over the weekend. Gareth Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: \u2018It won\u2019t be the best of Bank Holiday weekends. There\u2019s an Atlantic depression heading in towards the UK, bringing spells of quite heavy rain.\u2019 He added: \u2018Monday may start off sunny in some areas, particularly in the East, which will hold on to it for a good part of the day.\u2019 NHS Direct confirmed that this summer has seen the highest number of calls about insect bites and stings for three years. People coping with the humid weather by sleeping with their windows open and spending more time outside are finding themselves plagued by parasites. As people prepare to descend on parks and beer gardens over the bank holiday weekend chemists are ordering in extra supplies of bite remedies to combat the impact of increased numbers of insects eager to sink their 'teeth' into unwitting humans. Entomologist Steven Falk, from the conservation charity Buglife, said the mosquito population had dramatically increased on account of the wet spring and summer - which has created perfect breeding conditions for the pesky flies. 'The wet and humid weather has resulted in an increased breeding habitat for mosquitoes, such as pools and water-filled ditches, which has led to more people being bitten than during a normal year,' he said. Population explosion: Fleas like this one pictured in a dog's fur are also on the increase thanks to the wet and warm weather . And its not just insect remedies for humans that are flying off the shelves - there has also been a 'dramatic' increase in demand for flea treatments for household pets. The UK's flea population has also been thriving in the damp weather conditions, and sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours. Ouch: Tesco has reported a 150 per cent increase in demand for insect bite creams in the past week alone at its pharmacies across the UK . Lucy Chadwick, head vet for retailer Pet Drugs Online, said: 'The [sales] numbers do fluctuate a bit from time to time but this is quite dramatic.' Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two. He explained that the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its title - will live off dogs, ferrets and humans as well as felines. The boom is bad news for those of us susceptible to bites, as experts say that even when fleas appear to be beaten, they can make an unexpected return. Richard Mosely, of the British Pest Control Association, said: 'They have an ability to go into a sort of suspended animation. 'Even if you go into a flat which has been unoccupied for a year, their cocoons can be set off again by the carbon dioxide in people's breath.' Midges and other insects are also on the rise thanks to the washout summer, and NHS Direct has reported an overall rise in the number of calls about all varieties of stings and bites since early May. Calls to the service have doubled since the beginning of July, with the number of queries continuing to rise throughout the month of August. In the period since May, NHS Direct has dealt with 8,953 calls about bites and stings, compared to 8,641 this time last year, and 7,450 for the same period in 2010. Washout: Festivities marking the Queen's Diamond Jubilee were among the events marred by lashing rain this summer. Fans gathered to watch the river pageant are pictured sheltering from the showers . Despite recent warm temperatures, the summer of 2012 is likely to be remembered as one marred by persistent bouts of heavy rain. The pattern is set to continue with forecasters predicting a wet and windy bank holiday this weekend. Intermittent sunny spells are expected to be accompanied by stormy weather conditions that will sweep across the country - threatening to turn the bank holiday weekend into yet another washout.

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: (CNN) -- Airmen toss dirt bikes out the rear of an airborne plane. Then, a so-called \"bike chaser\" jumps out after them. When U.S. troops take control of an airfield in a combat zone, this often is how it begins. Parachutes unfurl. The motorbikes float to earth along with the bike chaser, who quickly cranks one of the motorcycles to life. Soon, the airfield is secured and ready for incoming U.S. aircraft. That's a typical mission for Air Force combat control teams, CCTs for short. And, along with seizing airfields, they help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets in war zones. These kinds of special forces could be useful on the ground in Iraq, military analysts say, in the event of U.S. airstrikes against Islamic extremists. The Navy has its SEALs. The Army has Delta Force. And the Air Force has combat controllers: a lesser known special ops ground force sometimes referred to as \"ground pounders.\" Maj. Charlie Hodges, who served with CCTs in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent a few minutes on the phone with CNN Wednesday to offer an inside perspective on these highly trained, elite squads. \"All of our guys are trained to ride motorcycles,\" says Hodges. Sometimes going to work \"involves jumping out of an airplane, or sliding out a helicopter down a fast rope, or riding some sort of all-terrain vehicle, or going on a mountain path on foot.\" Combat controllers are trained to help fighter pilots hit their targets more accurately without killing innocent civilians or friendly troops. That's a resource that military analysts say would be important now in Iraq's efforts to combat ISIS militants. Iraq's government has asked the United States for airstrikes against ISIS, as it encroaches on the nation's key cities. Limited airstrikes might be possible, analysts say, if U.S. forces were inserted where they could accurately identify targets. For days, military sources have said ISIS fighters are dispersed and mixed with local populations, making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes. Retired U.S. Marine Gen. John R. Allen, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The New York Times this month, \"It's feasible for the U.S. to play a limited role with air power with (special operations forces) combat controllers and limited advisers.\" On Thursday, President Barack Obama announced the United States had \"positioned additional U.S. military assets in the region.\" \"Because of increased intelligence resources,\" he said, the United States is \"developing more information about potential targets associated with (ISIS), and going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it.\" The President didn't offer any specifics. Related story: Who are the U.S. advisers heading to Iraq? Let's not forget that at the beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, ground controllers teamed up with Northern Alliance fighters to help U.S. pilots target and smash the Taliban. It's surprising: In this age of superaccurate smart bombs and camera-enabled, missile-toting drones, Hodges says human targeting intelligence remains the gold standard. \"People think that because they see it in a Jason Bourne movie\" that technology can do everything, Hodges says. \"But I don't think we're ever going to have a totally,100% air-centric war. I think we're always going to need boots on the ground.\" Their job ranks among the most dangerous in the military. Think about it: These guys regularly work near or inside the target zones of some of the most fearsome flying machines devised by man: the A-10 \"warthog,\" the B-2 stealth bomber, the Apache helicopter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the AC-130 gunship. 'It can be kind of squirrelly' Falling safely from the air to the ground with all that gear is no small feat. A typical drop comes with two motorcycles. Bike sizes often range from minibikes with 100 cubic centimeter engines to dirt bikes with 250 cubic centimeter engines. The motorcycles are dropped in packages called \"bike bundles.\" Small bikes have parachutes attached to the handlebars. \"It's small enough you can literally pick it up and just throw it out the back of the aircraft,\" says Hodges. \"And that's what they'll do.\" Engines are limited to around 250 cubic centimeters, Hodges says, because the combat controllers are riding with 100 pounds of gear on their backs. \"When you have your center of gravity that high, it can be kind of squirrelly,\" he says. \"So we do a fair amount of training,\" starting with a certified Motorcycle Safety Foundation course followed by intensive experience with various four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Bike chasers retrieve and mount the motorcycles and use them to quickly secure the air field runways and clear them of obstacles. \"Hopefully the bike's got an electric start \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and not just a kickstarter,\" Hodges says. If the bike takes a tumble when it lands, that could temporarily mess up its fuel system, he says, making it troublesome to fire up with a kickstarter. In addition to helping ID air targets, these troops also work to protect civilians and allied forces on the ground. \"If they're being fired on by the enemy, we can bring in aircraft,\" Hodges says. Controllers also have access to special airborne surveillance assets that give them \"eyes in the sky\" for U.S. ground troops who need to know \"what's on the other side of that building,\" as Hodges put it. \"When you're pinned down and can't move, having eyes in the sky to take out the enemy is pretty instrumental in making sure your guys come back alive.\" Air control for earthquake victims . Attached to the Air Force 24th Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Florida, these guys are FAA certified air traffic controllers. In 2010, the CCTs deployed to Haiti, responding to a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that left more than 230,000 people dead. At the airport in Port-au-Prince, \"nobody was sure of the structural integrity of the tower,\" says Hodges. \"So they set up in the infield and they landed 200 planes a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all with notebook paper, a card table and handheld radios.\" Two-hundred planes a day rivals air traffic at some of the world's busiest airports, including Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. The camaraderie you might expect between pilots and combat controllers is strong, Hodges says. \"It's always neat when you've worked with a guy here in the States and then go overseas and they call up and you recognize their call sign.\" There's also some professional, good-natured rivalry. \"We remind them that they're flying around in their air-conditioned cockpits,\" he says. \"We're on the ground in the heat and humidity, carrying 100 pounds on our backs.\""}]}

According to industry consulting firm Screen Engine, 17 percent of moviegoers are still reluctant to head to the theater following the shooting. While that number has dropped from the 21 percent who claimed they were reluctant one week after the shooting, it's still telling \u2014 and discouraging \u2014 for Hollywood. Fortunately, moviegoers have a lot of options to choose from. When the top seven movies at the box office all earn over $10 million, it's clear that the box office isn't in totally dire straits, but it doesn't seem to be firing on all cylinders. Sylvester Stallone and his weathered crew of grizzly action stars (and fresh-faced Liam Hemsworth) pushed their explosive sequel \"The Expendables 2\" to a $28.8 million debut, 17 percent lower than the $34.8 million bow of 2010\u2032s original \"Expendables.\" The number one debut marks the first time pop culture icon Chuck Norris has ever topped the box office. There really is nothing he can't do. Lionsgate spent $35 million to acquire the film, which was made by Nu Image for a reported $90 million. Audiences, which were 63 percent male and 65 percent above the age of 25 (both older and more male despite the addition of Hemsworth), issued the film a healthy \"A-\" CinemaScore grade. The explosive action entry also earned markedly better reviews than its predecessor, which could spur positive word-of-mouth, which Expendables 2 will need in order to match the original's $103.1 million domestic finish and for Stallone to justify another sequel. \"The Bourne Legacy\" held second place after dropping 55 percent to $17 million. Universal's $125 million sequel, which replaced star Matt Damon with \"The Avengers'\" Jeremy Renner, has now earned $69.6 million after ten days. By comparison, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" earned $69.3 million during its opening weekend in 2007. Focus Features' \"ParaNorman\" kicked off its run in third place with $14 million \u2014 a touch behind the $16.8 million that Coraline, which was also made by Laika Entertainment, earned in its debut. The 3-D flick, about a boy who can communicate with the dead, launched very wide in 3,429 theaters, and it achieved a rather lackluster $4,085 venue average \u2014 the least of any of the newcomers, including \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green,\" which found about $4,199 at each of its 2,598 theaters. Audiences gave \"ParaNorman\" a \"B+\" CinemaScore grade, which, again, was the lowest of any of the new releases, despite the fact that it earned the strongest critical reviews by far. \"ParaNorman\" will need some incredible holds in order to match Coraline's $75.3 million finish, but that film benefited from being part of the 3-D craze that peaked in 2009. \"ParaNorman\" is entering a very different marketplace where 3-D affection has long since passed. In fourth, Will Ferrell and Zack Galifinakis' comedy \"The Campaign\" dipped 50 percent to $13.4 million, which lifted the R-rated hit's total to $51.7 million. While \"The Campaign\" will likely miss the $100 million mark, it cost Warner Bros. only $30 million to make, and it should prove a profitable venture for the studio. The allure of Whitney Houston's final performance didn't drive many crowds to Sparkle, which began in fifth place with $12 million. As a point of comparison, the concert doc Michael Jackson: \"This Is It\" -- which arrived four months after Michael Jackson's death \u2014 started off hotter than \"Sparkle,\" earning $23.2 million in its opening weekend in October 2009 on the way to a $72.1 million finish. Sparkle didn't have 3-D ticket prices working on its side, but still, its less-than-stellar box office is somewhat surprising given Houston's status as pop royalty. Fortunately, the ScreenGems release cost only $14 million, and that low cost will be its saving grace. Thanks to a narrow theater count of 2,244, \"Sparkle\" notched a sturdy, if uninspiring, $5,348 per theater average, and if it can garner strong word-of-mouth \u2014 which seems likely given its \"A\" CinemaScore grade \u2014 it could find legs in the weeks to come. \"Sparkle's\" leading lady Jordin Sparks, who won Season 6 of \"American Idol,\" isn't the first Idol champ to show up at the box office, though she did garner the strongest opening weekend results. Season 4 winner Carrie Underwood had a supporting role in 2011\u2032s \"Soul Surfer,\" which opened to $10.6 million on the way to a $43.9 million finish. Season 1 winner Kelly Clarkson led the famously awful musical \"From Justin To Kelly,\" which earned $4.9 million total in 2003. Now, if only Sparks could match their album sales. As reported yesterday, sixth place finisher \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" which grossed $11.1 million (down 41 percent) in its fifth weekend, passed the $400 million milestone. It has now earned $409.9 million total, and has passed \"The Hunger Games\" ($407.7 million) as the 12th highest-grossing domestic performer of all time. The final new release of the weekend, \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green,\" started back in seventh place with $10.9 million. Disney's $25 million family drama, which stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner, earned $4.3 million on Wednesday and Thursday, which gives it an unremarkable five-day total of $15.2 million. \"Odd Life,\" which was issued an \"A-\" CinemaScore grade, will have to rely on (leafy) legs to drive its business. Garner has had bad luck at the box office ever since her breakout leading role in 2004\u2032s \"13 Going on 30.\" She has a few bright spots on her resume \u2014 namely the ensemble comedy \"Valentine's Day,\" which earned $110.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, the Matthew McConaughey rom-com \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,\" which grossed $55.3 million \u2014 but she's mostly starred in major misfires like Elektra ($24.4 million total), Catch and Release ($15.5 million), The Invention of Lying ($18.5 million), and Arthur ($33 million). Bubbling under the Top 10 at number 13, the anti-Obama documentary 2016 Obama's America expanded from 61 theaters into 169 locations, and increased its gross by 294 percent to $1.25 million. Tellingly, the film's per theater average increased from $5,202 to $7,391 this weekend, a rare feat at the box office \u2014 but especially when a film's theater count nearly triples. 2016 Obama's America has grossed $2.1 million in six weeks, and if it maintains this sort of momentum, it could become a major sleeper hit.

Honda is recalling more than 321,000 small SUVs and cars around the world over fears that the doors may not close properly and could even open while driving. The car manufacturer said on Thursday that if the inside driver or passenger door handles are used at the same time as the power or manual door locks, the inner door latch may not work. This means a door may not lock and could open while the car is in use. The recall affects 166,600 CR-Vs and more than 6,200 ILXs in the U.S. Faulty: Honda is recalling a total 321,453 CR-V SUV (above) and Acura ILX sedans worldwide over a door malfunction .

The company says that no accidents or injuries have been reported but federal law requires quick action when a potential safety issue is discovered - even if there have not been any problems reported by owners. Honda says dealers will inspect the cars and fix them if needed. Owners should get letters from the company starting in mid-August. The news came as a blow to Honda, just one day after the company announced it is ramping up production in the U.S. and expects to double its exports on vehicles made in America over the next few years. The manufacturer currently plans to export about 100,000 units to markets in Europe, South America and Asia, this year. Returns: In the U.S. 166,000 CR-V small SUVs and 6,200 model year 2013 Acura ILX (above) were recalled . Rick Schostek, senior vice president . of Honda of America Manufacturing, said on Wednesday: 'That number will . double in the next couple of years.' He said that in 2011 Honda's operations in the U.S. exported 53,000 units outside North America. Mr Schostek also announced that the . company will invest $40m in an Indiana plant thus increasing annual . production capacity by 50,000 units to produce a total of 250,000 cars. Honda staged more recalls than any other carmaker in 2011."}]}

A British artist has been killed and his partner is feared dead after a gas explosion ripped through the home they built together in Portugal. Glyn Uzzell, 84, had lived with Paul Fonk in the villa in the Algarve region for 35 years, and two works by David Hockney were thought to be hanging in his home when it was destroyed. Portuguese media reported tonight that Mr Uzzell's partner had been confirmed as a second victim in the tragic blast. Tragic: Glyn Uzzell (left) built the house himself with his partner Paul Fonk (right) in southern Portugal. It exploded in what is thought to have been an accidental gas blast yesterday which sent debris flying 300m away . Wreckage: The home was completely destroyed along with a separate studio for Mr Uzzell's work . The vast explosion yesterday morning was heard more than a mile away and completely obliterated the house, leaving its roof on a neighbour's property. Debris was thrown 300 metres away before police and rescue workers descended on the area, popular with British ex-pats, just before 8am local time. Destroyed: A print of The Diploma by David Hockney (pictured) was believed to be in Mr Uzzell's home . Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1930, Mr Uzzell studied at London's renowned Goldsmith\u2019s College before moving in 1957 to teach at the International School of Geneva, Switzerland. There he won prizes and was given a one-man exhibition at the city's Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Athen\u00e9e. It was there that he met his Luxembourg-born partner Mr Fonk and the pair moved to the Portuguese village of Caramujeira, near Lisbon, in 1979. They painstakingly renovated a dilapidated farmhouse into a villa and decorated it with art, including two works by the renowned British artist David Hockney. One of the works was believed to be a tongue-in-cheek etching of a fake diploma which Hockney made when the Royal College of Art refused to award him one after he spoiled an exam paper as a protest. Friend Rolf Osang said Mr Uzzell picked up . the artwork in a gallery in London's . Sloane Square for a little over \u00a35 soon after it was created in 1962. Called The Diploma, it was produced in an edition of 50 and has been hailed as one of Hockney's great early works. Another copy of The Diploma sold at auction for \u00a329,760 last year in London. Mr Uzzell's print, which featured a goose-stepping art school head and a monster, is thought to have been destroyed in the blast. Mr Osang, 64, who owns the Galeria Arte Algarve where Mr Uzzell exhibited much of his recent work, paid tribute to the artist. 'He's a very established artist and we . were very lucky to have him,' Mr Osang told MailOnline. Nothing left: Neighbours said they heard the blast more than a mile away and it sounded like an earthquake . Emergency response: Firefighters and paramedics attended the scene in the village of Caramujeira . 'He had been . very ill with heart problems and hadn't been exhibiting for five years, . but started again after he had a heart operation and had an implant put . in. 'He was an incredibly . warm person and a loving person and of course, such a loving person was . much loved by those who knew him too. Well-loved: Mr Uzzell was born in Swindon, Wiltshire and studied at Goldsmith's in London . 'He had the most wonderful house. He built it all himself with his partner and they had two pieces by David Hockney in the house, as well as a separate studio with his own works which I believe have been destroyed. 'He came often to the gallery and was very sociable. 'He was such a happy person and he came to the gallery only last Friday, completely jubilant about life and his recovering health. 'It's hit me and others in the art community here terribly. 'People felt the blast a mile and a half away. We have many small earthquakes here and it felt like one of those.' In a biography on his website, the artist wrote: 'My work is greatly influenced by the environment. 'Subjects are alluded to but not with straightforward representation. 'Time, place and mood play their part in images that are ostensibly abstract but reveal a point of contact with the visual world.' Mr Uzzell is believed to have a sister from Britain who visited him in Portugal earlier this year. A Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lagoa, Algarve. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Modern art: One of Mr Uzzell's works which hung in the Galeria Arte Algarve in Portugal . Investigation: Police at the scene of the blast yesterday morning, which was thought to be accidental ."}]}

Brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's forces are murdering civilians in organised attacks on towns and villages that amount to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said today. The rights group has now repeated its call for the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and to impose an arms embargo. Amnesty's findings, detailed in a 70-page report, add to reports of massacres elsewhere in Syria as the 15-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad was declared a civil war. It comes as a booby-trapped car exploded in a Damascus suburb this morning, wounding at least two people. Blast: A car bomb exploded in Damascus today as Amnesty International accused Syrian dictator Bashar Assad of crimes against humanity . Aftermath: The bomb exploded in a suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two . Devastation: Damaged shops at the site of a car bomb in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus this morning . Researchers visited 23 towns and villages in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces between April and May. They conducted interviews with more than 200 people, including many whose relatives had been killed or whose homes had been destroyed. Amnesty adviser Donatella Rovera said she had found repeated examples of brutality against civilians during two months of unauthorised visits to northwest Syria. She said: 'Wherever I went, in every town, in every village, there was a very similar pattern. 'Soldiers who went in, in very large numbers, for very short but very brutal incursions where they extra-judicially executed young men, burned down their homes. 'Those who they arrested were then tortured in detention. And that was really repeated in every town and every village that I visited. Fighters: Free Syrian Army members, with covered faces and holding weapons, sit by the side of a street in the Qaboun district of Damascus . Plea: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (left) wants the UN to make Kofi Annan's (right) peace plan obligatory . 'The bulk, the overwhelming majority of the violations are being committed by the government security forces and their paramilitary militia against the civilian population.' A peace plan brokered by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has failed to end bloodshed that has cost the lives of more than 10,000 people. Syria's government says it is not cracking down on activists, but fighting foreign-backed 'terrorists' it blames for killing hundreds of soldiers and police. Witnesses quoted in the Amnesty report said most of those killed had nothing to do with the resistance to Assad's rule. A resident of Saraqeb in Idlib . province described how soldiers had carried out door-to-door searches, . killing people as they fled or in their homes. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' He said: 'The army seemed to consider all the men in these towns, especially young men but not only, as terrorists. 'Most of those executed in this way . were not fighters, just ordinary people. Some were killed just because . the army could not find their wanted relatives.' Amnesty . said the report provided 'further evidence that deliberate and unlawful . killings are part of a widespread and systematic attack against the . civilian population'. A Labour town councillor who tweeted for the conflict in Syria to end claims his website has been hacked by supporters of dictator Bashar Assad's regime. A group calling itself Syria Storm has taken over the site detailing cllr Ben Hart's work for Lydd Town Council in Kent. Mr Hart, 23, said he was amazed someone thought his views were important enough to merit a personal attack. He said: 'I just don't understand it. I've spoken about Syria on Twitter, but mentioned nothing on my own website. 'I am not intimidated by the attack and it has given me the chance to go back and redesign it as I was intending to do anyway.' The homepage was left with a black background, a picture of the brutal Syrian leader, and the message it had been 'HaCk3d By Syrian Storm'. It was 'carried out in an organised manner and as part of state policy, and therefore amount to crimes against humanity'. Yesterday France called for the UN to enforce envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria - in a move which could see force used against Assad's regime. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was hoping that Russia, a key ally of Syria, would agree to invoking the UN's Chapter 7 to make it happen. It allows the use of military force. The first stage could be to impose a No Fly Zone and allow humanitarian aid into the country. But, as seen in other conflicts, it could escalate to more drastic action if the regime doesn't bend to international demands. And echoing UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous's comments the day before, he said the Syrian conflict was now a 'civil war'. He said: 'We propose making the implementation of the Annan plan compulsory. 'We need to pass to the next speed at the Security Council and place the Annan plan under Chapter 7 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions.' France would propose toughening sanctions on Syria at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers, he added. And the international community would prepare a list of second-ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice, alongside President Bashar Assad and his immediate entourage. He said: 'They must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression. The time for taking a decision has arrived. They have to jump ship.' International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . The chaos continued today as a car bomb exploded in a Damascus suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two people. Activists said regime troops were also continuing to shell rebellious areas in central Homs province. It was not immediately clear what the target of Thursday's blast in Sayyida Zainab was. State news said the car bomb detonated in a parking lot near the Imam Sadr Hospital, causing substantial material damage. Car bombs and suicide bombings have become common in Syria as the 15-month uprising against President Bashar Assad has become increasingly militarised with both sides of the conflict now using more powerful weapons. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three civilians were killed overnight in clashes at the entrances of the Jouret el-Shayyah neighborhood in Homs city. Another died in the rebel-held town of Rastan north of Homs, which has been under constant and intense fire from regime forces for days. Syrian forces yesterday overran a mountain enclave near the Mediterranean coast, seizing the territory back from rebels after battles that raged for eight days. State television said regime forces had 'cleansed' Haffa of 'armed terrorist groups' and the Foreign Ministry urged UN observers to immediately head there 'to check what the terrorist groups have done'. UN observers did not go to Haffa yesterday though and are assessing the situation to determine when they can successfully reach the town, UN peacekeeping spokesman Kieran Dwyer said. On Tuesday, an angry crowd hurled rocks and sticks at the UN mission's vehicles, forcing them to turn back. None of the observers was hurt. Sausan Ghosheh, a spokeswoman for the observers, said they have been trying to reach Haffa since June 7."}]}

A former IT specialist who claims that he is Jesus Christ has attracted a following in his native Australia from as far afield as Britain and the U.S. Alan John Miller, 50, says that not only is he Jesus, but his girlfriend Mary Luck is Mary Magdalene, who according to the Bible was present at the crucifixion. In one recording he says: 'There's . probably a million people who say they're Jesus and most of them are in . asylums. 'But one of us has to be. How do I know I am? Because I remember . everything about my life.' Mr Miller has 'very clear memories' of his crucifixion 2,000 years ago, but claims that he only 'remembered' that he was Jesus in 2004. He explains on his Divine Truth website that he and 'other . Celestial Angels' tried to convey divine truth to an American man named James . Padgett between 1914-23 in New York. However, 'unfortunately, no-one really fully understood the message . that was given.' So Mr Miller and Mary Magdalene . 'found a way to return to earth to demonstrate these Truths', with '7 . soul pairs, or 14 people', to teach people themselves. Miller, a divorced father-of-two, said his first marriage broke down when he 'began to remember details' of the incarnation. Holy couple: Miller with Mary Luck, who believes that she is Mary Magdalene . Mr Miller now runs his Divine Truth church from his home near the small town of Kingaroy in the state of Queensland. He can attract up to 150 people to his sermons. Mr Miller and Miss Luck do not have conventional employment and their lifestyles appear to be funded by supporter donations though they say that followers are not pressed to give money.

Royal Mail will increase the price of second class stamps by 50 per cent if it gets the go-ahead. The State-owned company wants the cost of the stamps to rise from the current 36p to at least 50p. Regulator Ofcom has been carrying out a consultation aimed at giving greater commercial freedom to Royal Mail, including handing the firm the power to set the price of first class stamps. Sky high: Royal Mail have demanded the right to charge people as much as they want to send a letter . It is proposing a cap on second class . stamps of between 45p and 55p, but Royal Mail has confirmed it wants . them to be at the upper end of the scale. Ofcom said its proposals, announced . in October, were aimed at protecting the universal service obligation . (USO) under which the Royal Mail has to deliver to any address in the UK . for the same price, six days a week. It has been under pressure in recent . years because of falling mail volumes, which has seen the number of . letters delivered every day slump by 22 million to 62 million between . 2006 and 2010, contributing towards a loss of \u00a3120million last year. Consumers have also switched from . first to second class mail - now posted in equal numbers - while stamp . prices have lagged behind inflation for almost 20 years. Soaring: The price of a first class stamp has risen from 27p in 2000 to 46p today . The price of a first class stamp in . the UK is among the lowest in Europe at 46p, compared with 69p in Italy, . 67p in Denmark and 60p in Greece, while service targets are among the . highest, Ofcom pointed out. The Federation of Small Businesses said . it has \u2018extreme concerns that the small business community will . disproportionately suffer under the new reforms.\u2019 Yesterday Royal Mail insisted it must be able to charge as much as it likes for a first or second class stamp. In . a decision which will trigger outrage among its customers, the . State-owned company wrote to Britain\u2019s postal regulator insisting . all the current price caps, should be scrapped. The . letter, seen by the Daily Mail, states clearly: \u2018Royal Mail does not . believe that the case is strong for the imposition of a price cap on any . of our products.\u2019 The letter states that, if Ofcom insists . on a price cap, that it \u2018should be set at the upper end of Ofcom\u2019s . proposed range (ie 55p.)\u2019 It went on to say that it believes there is . \u2018no affordability concern\u2019 for Britain\u2019s cash-strapped households. The campaign group, Consumer Focus, . has already raised its concerns about Ofcom\u2019 s proposals, which it fears . could lead to \u2018steep price rises for customers.\u2019 A spokesman said: \u2018In the worst case . it could result in a financially troubled Royal Mail, which remained in . public hands, imposing higher and higher prices on its dwindling . customer base and with its modernisation programme mired in industrial . relation problems.\u2019 Other . responses to Ofcom\u2019s consultation, which were published yesterday, raise . major concerns about how small businesses will cope with future price . hikes. Clive Davenport, . chairman of the federation\u2019s trade unit, warned: \u2018In the worst case . scenario, they may be priced out of the market with no suitable postal . competitor to switch to.\u2019 The Forum of Private Business said \u2018no-limit increases\u2019 in stamp prices will \u2018harm\u2019 small business. Jane Bennett, head of campaigns, said: \u2018It would simply create another cost barrier to trading for small firms reliant on postal services who can ill afford further price hikes. \u2018We understand that Royal Mail is currently a loss-making organisation and action needs to be taken to address this. \u2018But we believe constant price rises are not the way to tackle the issue.\u2019 She added: \u2018During the difficult economic climate, we believe it is unjustifiable for Royal Mail to increase its prices by large amounts without check.\u2019 Latest figures show Royal Mail\u2019s UK letters and parcels division lost \u00a341million between March and September last year.

It is still a tropical storm, as it drifts farther away from the state. Hurricane Julio should pass by over the weekend and is expected to track north of Hawaii, according to current predictions, sparing the state. But the weather service advised the public to remain diligent, as weather conditions and the forecast could change. Iselle's top winds weakened to 60 mph as it made landfall at 2:30 a.m. Friday along the Kau coast of the Big Island. Had the storm remained a hurricane, it would have been the first to hit Hawaii in decades. By Friday night, the National Weather Service canceled the tropical storm warnings for Maui County and Oahu. Kauai, however, remained under a tropical storm warning. A warning for Hawaii County was canceled earlier. A flash flood watch remained in place for the state through 6 a.m. Saturday. Iselle was still producing locally damaging wind gusts over the smaller islands, the statement said. The state's primary election was expected to take place Saturday despite the storm. Abercrombie, who has taken advantage of the storm to show leadership and appear on television, is in a tough race against State Sen. David Ige in the Democratic primary. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz faces a challenge from U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Schatz was appointed to the seat after the death of longtime Sen. Daniel Inouye. Heavy rains were the biggest threat, with general rainfall predicted to be between 4 and 8 inches, although some areas could get more than a foot. Flash flood warnings cover much of the Big Island, while flash flood watches have been issued for the entire state. Iselle has already delivered 11 inches of rain on the Big Island, according to Mike Cantin with the National Weather Service. In a conference call, Cantin said the Big Island should expect more than a foot of rain. Doug Mayne, of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said heavy rains have prevented the agency from beginning to assess the impact of the storm. Conditions made it unsafe to get helicopters in the air to access the hardest-hit areas. Hawaii Electric Light said in a tweet that nearly 22,000 customers were without power in various parts of the Big Island. As the storm approached, supermarket shelves were swept bare, while schools and government offices closed. Sandbags were placed around homes and hotels, and ports told to close. In Hawaii County, 630 people have gone to shelters, Mayor Billy Kenoi told CNN affiliate KHON-TV in Honolulu. Track the storm . The state had prepared for a potentially devastating one-two tropical cyclone punch, starting with Iselle and followed by Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm, about 900 miles behind it. Hurricane Julio could affect the islands over the weekend, though forecasters expect it to brush the state only with its southern outer bands as it passes to the north as a weakened tropical storm. Julio had strengthened to a Category 3 storm with top winds of 120 mph by Friday morning, when it was centered less than 1,000 miles away. A relatively rare event . Direct hits are rare for the state. Since the 1950s, two hurricane eyes have hit Hawaii -- and both approached from the south, where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms' strength. That's not to say Hawaii hasn't had close calls. The central Pacific sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year, and some have brushed the state in recent decades. The cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern Pacific. But close to Hawaii, dry air, cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones, dissipating them before they can become a significant threat, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures. This year hasn't met the criteria for El Nino, but it could in the weeks ahead, Petersons said. Iniki killed at least four people and caused about $2 billion in damage when it hit the western Hawaiian island of Kauai, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. School's out; air travel disrupted . The schools on the Big Island and Maui were closed Friday as residents assessed Iselle's impact. Some airlines made concessions to customers. Hawaiian Airlines moved one flight, to Los Angeles, up by five hours to beat Iselle's arrival. For people who had been scheduled to travel to or from Hawai's airports on Thursday and Friday, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said they won't charge fees to change reservations, and they'll waive differences in fares for those changes. United canceled flights to Hilo and Kona. American Airlines and US Airways also called off flights out of Kona on Thursday but expected Friday's flight schedule to operate normally. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta Air Lines said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply. It said two flights had been delayed in leaving the islands.

UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 14 November 2013 . Residents of several Florida homes have been evacuated due to a sinkhole that opened up in a Dunedin, Florida backyard, near St Petersburg Thursday. Dunedin Deputy Fire Chief Trip Barrs said the hole appeared to be about 12-feet wide when officials arrived on the scene around 6am, but grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep by 9am. Residents of seven neighboring houses were evacuated as a precaution and power has been shut off in the area. No injuries have been reported. Scroll down for video . Into the earth: A sinkhole opened up this morning in Dunedin, Florida, swallowing up parts of two homes . Expanding: When fire and rescue responders arrived on the scene around 6am, the sinkhole was 12-feet-wide but soon grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep . Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole . Homeowner Michael Dupre said they heard the sinkhole open up in their backyard around 5:15 this morning. 'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' his daughter Ivy Dupre told Fox 13. Ivy Dupre said that there seemed to be two sinkholes, one that opened up in the backyard and one near her bedroom, but that has not yet been confirmed by fire and rescue officials. The sinkhole has swallowed up the master bedroom and in-ground pool of one home, while another home lost their deck and boat. After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground. Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole. On February 28, Jeffrey Bush died when a sinkhole opened under his bedroom in Seffner, Florida, near Tampa. His body was never recovered. In August, sections of a building at a resort near Orlando collapsed into a sinkhole. No one was injured in that sinkhole. Early morning surprise: According to homeowners in the area, the sinkhole opened up at about 5:15 this morning . 'After the Seffner sinkhole, we were scared,' Mr Dupre told WTSP. 'We've been dealing with our insurance company and finally two days ago, they started working on our house. Now it looks like our house is gone.' State officials say three counties in the Tampa region are known as 'sinkhole alley.' Two-thirds of the sinkhole damage claims reported to the state Office of Insurance Regulation between 2006 and 2010 came from Hernando, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Dunedin is in neighboring Pinellas County."}]}

The Powerball jackpot jumped to $550 million on Thursday \u2014 the third largest lottery in history \u2014 as dreamers in all but the seven states where the game isn't played snatched up tickets for the minuscule chance at a life on easy street. Thursday's announcement by the Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association means ticket sales have soared since Wednesday night's drawing for an estimated $360 million jackpot, in which no one picked all six numbers correctly. Sales jumped by $260 million in the days before November's biggest Powerball jackpot win in history \u2014 a prize of $587.5 million. And Iowa Lottery spokeswoman Mary Neubauer said it's possible that Saturday's could end up eclipsing that amount. Sight to see: The Powerball Jackpot has steadily jumped to $550 million, seen earlier at $475 in California on Thursday, as ticket sales surged following Wednesday's failed win . Lining up: People line up to buy lottery tickets at the Bluebird Liquor store in Hawthorne, California before Saturday's drawing . A $550 million jackpot would be the second largest in Powerball history and the third largest for any lottery. Lottery officials expect jackpot totals of this size to continue to climb in shorter amounts of time, thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012 that increased the odds of winning some kind of prize, but also lowered the possible number combinations to win the Powerball. There's also 'cross-selling' of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets \u2014 states being able to sell both Powerball tickets and Mega Millions tickets \u2014 that began in January 2010. As a result, large jackpots will continue to surpass all-time jackpot records set years ago, said Neubauer. 'It usually took a handful of months, if not several months, for a jackpot to reach this large amount,' she said. 'Now it's achieving that within a handful of weeks. I think the redesign is achieving exactly what we had wanted it to achieve, which is the bigger, faster-growing jackpot.' Lucky hand? Lilly Sanchez holds up lotto tickets she purchased including a Powerball ticket in Orlando, Florida on Thursday . Making history: The estimated prize of $550 million would be the third largest in lottery history while the second largest for Powerball . Ready to go: Powerball tickets, right, along with other lotto tickets are seen at the ready in Florida on Thursday as all but seven states rush to buy in . The redesign means players don't necessarily have to strike big to get lucky. A $1 increase and new $1 million and $2 million prizes means the odds of winning something have increased. On Wednesday, $1 million prizes were won in 16 states, and $2 million prizes were won in two states. In fact, more than half of the all-time jackpot records have been reached in the last three years. The top two all-time jackpots \u2014 $656 million from a Mega Millions jackpot and $587.5 million from a Powerball jackpot \u2014 were achieved in 2012. The last major jackpot win came when a New Jersey man won a $338.3 million jackpot on March 23. It is now considered the fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history. Players aren't complaining about the . large sums. Rachel Rand said she just couldn't help herself and bought . several Powerball tickets. Last winner: The last major jackpot win was by Pedro Quezada of New Jersey, pictured, who won a $338.3 million jackpot on March 23 - the believed fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history . 'How can you not play $2?' said the 32-year-old insurance adjustor. 'A $10 investment if you win is pretty good.' Insurance agent Joe Williams, of Middleton, Wis., doesn't necessarily spend more when the prize is high. But his $4 investment in the quick-pick option means he does spend. 'I know rationally it makes no sense,' he said. 'But at the same time, without a ticket, I have zero chance.' Tom Powers, 52, a janitor from Omaha, Neb., bought several tickets Tuesday from a convenience store. He said he would definitely walk away from work if he won the jackpot, but he's not sure how he would spend all the winnings. 'It's really unfathomable the amount of money this is putting out,' Powers said."}]}

A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, \"I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else.\" Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed. \"We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period,\" a statement on the hospital's Web site said, adding, \"It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C.\" An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4, 2009, and July 1, 2009, when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs. Audubon is also contacting patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer."}]}

That explains why baby Jasleen, born in Germany last week, weighed more than 13 pounds. Her mother had gestational diabetes, but her condition wasn't discovered until she went into labor and checked herself into University Hospital Leipzig. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and resembles other forms of diabetes in that it affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). With gestational diabetes, a mother's blood sugar should return to normal soon after delivery. However, the condition puts women at risk for type 2 diabetes in the future. For every 100 pregnant women in the U.S, two to 10 will have gestational diabetes, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention says. A woman who has gestational diabetes during pregnancy and maintains a high blood-sugar level may have a baby born abnormally large, weighing 9 pounds or more, the CDC says. A baby's large size creates problems for the delivery of the child through the birth canal and may cause nerve damage in the child's shoulder during birth. \"A very large baby has an increased chance of being overweight or obese later in life,\" the CDC says. \"Being overweight or obese increases the chance of also having diabetes later in life.\" Gestational diabetes results from hormonal changes that every woman has during pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Elevated levels of certain hormones made in the placenta disrupt insulin's ability to manage glucose, a condition called insulin resistance. (The placenta is the organ connecting the baby by the umbilical cord to the uterus and sends nutrients from mother to child.) As the placenta becomes larger throughout pregnancy, it creates more hormones, which, in turn, increases the insulin resistance, the Cleveland Clinic said. The mother's pancreas is typically able to make three times the normal amount of insulin to beat this resistance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If the pancreas can't produce the required amount of insulin, however, sugar levels will rise, and the woman will have gestational diabetes. You may be at risk for gestational diabetes if you are overweight before becoming pregnant, have a family history of diabetes, are older than 25, have previously giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds, previously gave birth to a stillborn baby, have had gestational diabetes with a previous pregnancy or have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, the Cleveland Clinic said. Women typically find out whether they have gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's when insulin resistance usually begins. If you previously had gestational diabetes or if your doctor is concerned about your risk of developing it, you can be tested for the condition before the 13th week of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. An oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen for gestational diabetes. This involves consuming 50 grams of glucose in a beverage. Your body will absorb the glucose and cause your blood sugar levels to rise within 30 to 60 minutes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Blood samples are taken from a vein in your arm 30 minutes after consuming the sweetened drink so that your doctor can evaluate how your body processes glucose. According to the Mayo Clinic, expectant mothers can control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if required, taking medication. Treatment may include monitoring blood sugar four to five times a day, which involves drawing a drop of blood from your finger and testing it with a blood glucose meter. Your health care providers will monitor and manage your blood sugar levels during labor and delivery. Following up with blood sugar checks after the baby is born is also important. You can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on by continuing to eat a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report."}]}

As the Scotsman beat the world number one Novak Djokovic to become Wimbledon champion in a gripping straight sets victory, he was roared on by everyone from Victoria Beckham to Hangover-star Bradley Cooper, and Wayne Rooney to David Cameron. Wimbledon legend Rod Laver, who claimed victory at the All England Tennis Club no less than four times during his career, sat next to Labour leader Ed Miliband, while WAG Colleen Rooney and actress and model Suki Waterhouse added to the glamorous female contingent absorbing all the action on Centre Court. Household names: Film stars Bradley Cooper and Gerard Butler took their seats alongside Victoria Beckham and Prime Minister David Cameron to watch from the Royal Box as Andy Murray stormed to victory at Wimbledon . As the eyes of . the country focused on this small corner of South West London yesterday . afternoon, the best seats in the house were reserved for an eclectic . mixture of high-profile fans. Many . of those taking their seats in the Royal Box were former players who . once reigned supreme on Wimbledon's grass courts themselves; from . American Stan Smith - who held the trophy aloft in 1972 - to Spaniard . Manuel Santana, who was crowned champion in 1966. Former British number . one Greg Rusedski also brought along wife Lucy Connor to enjoy all the . action courtside.

Girls' day out: Fast friends Victoria Beckham and Tana Ramsay sat side by side to watch Andy Murray storm to victory at Wimbledon yesterday . And it wasn't just champions from the tennis world taking their seats in the exclusive section - footballer Wayne Rooney watched alongside wife Colleen, while golfing star Justin Rose, there to take in the match with his wife Kate, was spotted laughing with actor Gerard Butler. Butler, the star of Hollywood blockbusters including 300 and PS I Love You, attracted almost as much attention as his fellow countryman Andy Murray's efforts on court yesterday, as he and fellow film star Bradley Cooper brought a dash of A-list glamour to the box in co-ordinating summery blue suits and shades. Star power: Actors Bradley Cooper and Gerard Butler caused a stir as they arrived in the Royal Box in co-ordinating blue suits to watch Gerard's fellow countryman Andy Murray take on Djokovic .

Cooper was also accompanied by his . girlfriend, British model and actress Suki Waterhouse, but seemed to pay . more attention to Butler as the pair played up to the cameras capturing . their every reaction to the increasingly tense match. Ms Waterhouse . meanwhile was left to chat to the Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn . King, who was sitting to her right. The . world of politics was also well represented, with Prime Minister David . Cameron applauding Andy Murray's every winning shot from the front row, . accompanied by his mother Mary. Behind . him was Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who was branded a . 'grade one wally' for gleefully unfurling a giant Saltire flag behind Mr . Cameron as Murray was crowned victor - in what many saw as a political . ploy to gain support for Scottish independence. Also looking on were Maria Miller, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, and her husband Iain, and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards, while acclaimed classical pianist Mitsuko Uchido, wearing a quirky pair of glasses, appeared deep in conversation with the Duke of Kent in the front row. There were jubilant scenes in the Royal Box as Andy Murray sealed his much longed-for victory to take the title, but not everybody in the section was entirely thrilled with the result. Sitting alongside Ed Miliband's wife Justine Thornton was Tomislav Nikolic, the Serbian president, who was no doubt disappointed to see Djokovic dispatched in straight sets by the Scotsman.

Eclectic mixture: Ed Miliband shared a joke with four-time Wimbledon champion Rod Laver in the Royal Box, as Colleen and Wayne Rooney, and Victoria Beckham and Tana Ramsay watched from the rows behind . Sporting champions: The Royal Box was awash with sporting talent yesterday, and not just from the world of tennis; footballer Wayne Rooney was there, left, as was South African born English golfer Justin Rose, right . The Royal Box has been reserved for the entertainment of friends and guests of Wimbledon since 1922. The guest list is made up of members of the British and foreign royal families, heads of government, big names from the tennis world, the tournament's commercial partners and the British Armed Forces. Representatives of prominent media organisations, supporters of British tennis are also among those lucky enough to make the cut. Invitations come from the Chairman of the All England Club, and take into account suggestions from members of The Championships' Organising Committee and the Lawn Tennis Assocation along with other relevant partners. The jovial atmosphere evident in the Royal Box yesterday will have continued after Murray raised the trophy, as guests are invited to the Clubhouse for lunch, tea and drinks at the end of the day. Prime Minister David Cameron's suit and tie provoked a lot of reaction on Twitter given the soaring temperatures, but he was merely following protocol, as male guests in the Royal Box are asked to wear smart dress such as a suit or jacket and tie. Ladies are asked not to wear hats to prevent obscuring the view of those sitting behind them."}]}

The Blue star, whose hits include the group's May 2001 UK number four single All Rise, was selected as the eighth juror on a 12-person panel to listen to evidence against a defendant facing assault charges during a three-day trial. However, as the singer was about to take his seat in the jury box, Judge Mary Jane Mowat, sitting at Oxford Crown Court, said: 'I believe I know this gentleman.' Bye bye: Judge Mary Jane Mowat, left, dismissed Blue star Lee Ryan, right, from the jury after she recognised him . The 28-year-old said casually: 'If you like music you might have done. I haven\u2019t been to court or anything.' To which the judge replied: 'I was thinking more about horses.' After a brief pause, Mr Ryan, who is known to have ridden in the past, pointed at the judge and said: 'Oh yeah.' 'I would ask that you please stand down,' added Judge Mowat. Blond Mr Ryan, dressed in a denim jacket, tee-shirt, jeans and green trainers, then rose, looking somewhat pleased as he turned around and walked to the back of the courtroom. Mr Ryan, who rose to fame in 2001, lives in nearby Yarnton near Oxford, which was why he was selected for jury service. Six men and six women were chosen to sit on the case of Amar Khan, aged 27, of Windrush Drive, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Khan was charged with unlawful wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding, as well as two counts of assault by beating after the attack in Cowley, Oxon, on July 15 last year. Prosecutor Jonathon Stone told the hearing that the defendant was part of a gang of four men who burst into a mother-of-three\u2019s home and demand she hand over drugs. It was alleged Khan used a claw hammer to hit Charlotte Marshall\u2019s boyfriend Ade Adeniran over the head in a bloody attack, which left him needing stitches. The gang made their getaway empty-handed, but Khan was the only suspect police caught, the hearing was told. His fingerprints were found in a silver Citron car used as the getaway vehicle. A Tesco receipt found in the car placed him near to the scene just 20 minutes before the assault. Khan admits being in the car but not during the time of the attack. The case continues."}]}

Mark Cowgill, 29, and six others were using the gents when the floor collapsed and sent them crashing into the drinks cellar of Hell Polish Club in Eccles. None of the seven men were injured when they fell, and ambulance crews, including those specially trained in hazardous area response, were speedily dispatched to the Church Road club shortly after 1.30am on March 15. Clubbers fell through the floor after the toilet collapsed in a Salford nightclub, which miraculously didn't leave anyone injured . Greater Manchester Police attended the incident and a building control officer was called to secure the scene and investigate. The council said that evidence of a water leak was found at the area of the collapse, which may have been the cause. A spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service said four of the men were taken to Salford Royal with minor injuries. It was described by one survivor as 'like something out of a film' as the floor creaked and gave way below him . The cause of the collapse is unclear, although examiners from the council believe it might be due to water leakages . A survey was recommended to assess the full extent of the damage, and the club remained open after the incident but it is not known whether or not it has been open since. However, the council apparently has no power to force it to shut. Cowgill said: 'I was just washing my hands when we heard a creak.

In . the UK, the OECD says 50 per cent of children\u2019s prospects are . predictable from the position of their parents \u2013 a sign of low social . mobility. This was worse than Italy (48 per cent), the US (47 per cent) and\u00a0 France (41 per cent). Poverty: Britain's failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, MPs say (file photo) The prospects of poorer children born in Australia (17 per cent) and Denmark (15 per cent) are much brighter. Britain\u2019s failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, the MPs say. The report makes it clear the differences become ingrained as young as the age of three. Studies have shown that while only 42 per cent of parents in the poorest fifth of homes read to their children every day, 78 per cent of those in the richest fifth do so. Wealthier parents are also more likely to send their children to bed at a regular time. It has led to richer children being more likely to be deemed \u2018ready\u2019 for school at three. Better future: The prospects of poorer children born in Denmark (above) and Australia (below) are much brighter . They also perform much better in vocabulary tests at five. Children from poorer households are more likely to be hyperactive. The MPs called on the Government to consider ways of improving the education of those from poor backgrounds, such as means-testing fees at independent schools to get more poor people into top schools and sending more poor children to summer camps. But it failed to mention either the return of grammar schools or the assisted-places scheme for poorer families, which was abolished by the last Labour government. The MPs\u2019 report concluded that the biggest impact on social mobility was the quality of parenting, whether the home environment was educational and whether the parents had good mental health. It says: \u2018A child\u2019s development from zero to three is the point of greatest leverage for social mobility. It is acknowledged that this is difficult territory for policy makers as it relates to parenting as well as what happens in childcare and nursery settings.\u2019 The conclusion will be controversial because it could be used to support greater \u2018nanny state\u2019 interference into families. The MPs urged ministers to do more to encourage parents to read to children using techniques similar to the \u2018five-a-day\u2019 campaign which encourages people to eat more fruit and veg. The study also found that the gap between rich and poor on university access has widened. In 1981, children from the richest fifth of households were three times more likely than those from the poorest fifth to go to university. By the late 1990s, they were five times more likely to go."}]}

The six-year-old girl and boy, seven, had gone by the time they got back to the flat - having been collected by the police after a neighbour called at 5.40am to say the children were home alone. Avoided jail: The pair, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the older mother\u2019s home in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at about 11pm and going onto a party where they stayed until 11am the next day . Officers found that the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow, Gloucester Crown Court was told. The two mothers pleaded guilty to child neglect and were both sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years, as well as a supervision order, offender programme and overnight curfew. Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - he only spared them jail to avoid their children suffering further. The judge said: \u2018Your decision to go out was utterly irresponsible. It amounted to the two of you putting your own selfish pleasures above the welfare of your children.\u2019 Both children were taken into care after the offence but the boy - the son of the older woman - had been returned to her after four weeks. However, the younger woman\u2019s daughter remains in foster care - although her mother has access to her under supervision three times a week. Sentencing: Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) was told that officers found the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow . Describing the circumstances found by the police when they arrived at the flat, Mr Kesner said they initially knocked on the door but got no reply - although they could hear movement inside. An officer opened the letterbox and saw the children. He asked if anyone else was in the flat. The boy replied: \u2018My mum went to the High Street but she wasn\u2019t here when we woke up.\u2019 Mr Kesner said \u2018On looking at the children the officer could see they appeared frightened, uncomfortable and cold. The police therefore opened the door and the little girl was crying. \u2018She said she didn\u2019t have anything to wear on her bottom half of her body so the police looked in the boy\u2019s bedroom to see if they could find anything suitable for her to put on. \u2018In his bedroom they noticed what is described as his bedding being a thin dirty duvet with no pillow. There were hardly any clothes in the chest of drawers, just a single school uniform and two T-shirts. \u2018The police looked for food in the fridge and the kitchen but it was almost bare. I think Your Honour has seen the state of the kitchen with hardly any food in it. \u2018All the police noticed were empty bottles of wine and spirits. The little girl was asked when she had last eaten. This was a Saturday morning and she said the last she had eaten was breakfast on Friday morning.\u2019 Both women had previous criminal convictions but not for any relevant offences, Mr Kesner said. The girl\u2019s mum had a drug conviction on her record. Lloyd Jenkins, for the girl\u2019s mother, said: \u2018There are no excuses. On April 25 she was extremely selfish. She decided to have a night out and ignore the welfare of her daughter. \u2018What she did was deplorable. She is ashamed of what she did and regrets her behaviour. She has said \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me\u201d.\u2019 The woman had a history of depression, anxiety and alcoholism but since November last year had stopped drinking apart from a lapse over Christmas, he said. Her abusive partner was now out of her life having been sentenced to six and a half years imprisonment for grievous bodily harm, he added. Joe Maloney, for the boy\u2019s mother, said the woman realised how stupid she had been and how much the children were at risk. \u2018There have been no further difficulties since (her son) was returned to her,\u2019 said Mr Maloney. \u2018She is determined to ensure this sort of incident does not take place again.'"}]}

But some experiences around the world are more extreme than others, even putting holidaymakers at risk of arrest. From Bolivia's so-called Death Road - a mountain-side route that tourists tackle on bikes - to the experience of being 'arrested' by Soviet secret police in Lithuania, here are some of the most extreme tours that holidaymakers pay for around the world. Memories of the horrific nuclear blast remain for tourists to see on the Fukushima tour . Contamination levels are now low enough for coach tours to visit the Fukushima power plant . The Fukushima Nuclear Reactor Tour - Japan . The Fukushima site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has become a tourist attraction. Local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area, explaining what has become of the disaster zone. Back in 2011, three of the Fukushima Nuclear Plant's six reactors blew up following a tsunami, releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated. However, with contamination levels said to be 'low', people are being permitted on whistle-stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place. Tourists who visit Lithuania get the chance to experience the terrors of a Soviet bunker . Holidaymakers must sign a waiver before agreeing to sign up for the Soviet Bunker Tour . The Soviet Bunker Experience - Lithuania . Lithuania offers a chance for holidaymakers to experience what life was like under the control of the USSR - using real dogs and former KGB officers, and taking place in a former Soviet bunker. The terrifying experience starts with visitors being 'ambushed' by the Red Army in the middle of the forest, 15 miles from the capital Vilnius, before being transported down into the bunker for a three-hour Soviet experience. Before taking part in the experience, which is called 1984: The Survival Drama, holidaymakers are asked to sign a waiver, which includes a clause stating: 'In case of disobedience participants may receive psychological or physical punishments.' Mexicans are led to the border with the US all for show in the Illegal Border Crossing Experience . The Illegal Border Crossing Experience - Mexico . A small town in Mexico has set up a quasi-theme park that offers visitors the chance to experience what Mexican immigrants go through when they illegally cross the U.S. border. For approximately $20 (\u00a313), tourists visiting El Alberto can spend their Saturday night getting a three-hour simulated experience of what it is like to be a migrant attempting to cross the border. Participants in the Caminata Nocturna, which translates as 'night walk', go on a challenging trek where they must evade 'immigration officials' and 'border patrol agents' as they flee through rough terrain. Of course, unlike the millions of migrants who illegally cross into the U.S, the tourists\u2019 lives are in no real danger. A worst case scenario here would be a nasty fall. Make Your Own Cocaine Tour - Colombia . The South American country has cocaine 'factory' tours high up in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada. Holidaymakers willing to take extreme risks can work with local guides to visit poverty-stricken farmers who gamble with their lives in a desperate bid to provide for their families. Tours of the illegal farms can cost as little as $9 (\u00a36), but tourists put themselves at risk from paramilitaries operating in the area - who have been known to kidnap foreigners and hold them years at a time - or arrest by local police. Both experiences are highly illegal and even seeking them out can put foreign travellers at risk of arrest or attack by drug traffickers or paramilitaries. Those who take part in the underground tours can be arrested even if they are just caught on the property of the drug-makers. Many people like taking on a bungee jump, but would you fancy doing one over a crocodile-infested river? Bungee Jumping Over Crocodile-infested Waters - Zambia/Zimbabwe border . Tourists can leap head first from the Victoria Bridge over the crocodile-infested Zambezi River. However, back in 2012, then 22-year-old Australian Erin Langworth took on the bungee challenge, with almost fatal consequences. After flying off the bridge, her rope snapped and she plunged into the water, feet still bound. Her rope got caught on rocks, but that was the least of her trouble with crocodiles swarming. Miraculously, she managed to untangle the rope, and swim to safety with just cuts, bruises and a broken collarbone. Tourists get the chance to explore the Bolivian mines of Potosi, with dynamite strapped to their backs . Mining With Dynamite - Bolivia . In the Silver Mines of Potosi, Bolivia, you can crawl around in the gravel with dynamite strapped to your back. Not only that, but you are handed 95 per cent proof alcohol to give you the Dutch courage to continue on your quest. But once you've polished off the tipple, be prepared to put your mask on, as the dynamite show begins - the walls of the mines shake and disintegrate around you. Not one for the faint-hearted. Silver Lining Tours allow visitors to get up close and personal to Tornados in America's Midwest . Tornado Tours - America's Midwest . Silver Lining Tours will take guests to within a quarter of a mile of some of the swirling 300mph vertical wind funnels. Storm-chasers Roger and Caryn Hill are now taking British punters on the hunt of their lives following deadly and destructive tornados. Ploughing their way through 'Tornado Alley', the couple drive groups of up to 18 people in three buses and charge up to \u00a3230 a day for a ten-day chase. At 15,400ft, The Death Road in Bolivia is a favourite spot for thrill-seeking cyclists . The Death Road Tour - Bolivia . At 15,400f, Bolivia's North Yungus Road - better known as 'The Death Road' - is among the nation's biggest draw cards for thrill-seeking tourists, even though it is estimated that 300 people die here every year. Dubbed 'El Camino de la Muerte' (The Death Road) by locals, for obvious reasons, and considered by many the most dangerous stretch of road in the world, the 40-mile journey from its summit entices in excess of 25,000 mountain bike riders annually. The ride takes in the stunning views among the rolling hills of the Amazon rainforest, but come with the somewhat distracting - and for some terrifying -sheer drop into the canopy as two rubber tyres separate the rider from a narrow single-lane road with very little in the way of railings. For the locals, the 'Death Road' is an important transport route which they brave in cars and trucks, teetering on the edge and risking their lives with every trip. For companies such as Gravity Bolivia, a cycling tour company that offers riders the opportunity to experience the once in a lifetime journey through clouds and waterfalls, it's big business."}]}

Miss Blackman told thisiscornwall.co.uk that neighbours had previously placed traffic cones near to her car when she parked in the space.

European pilots and cabin crew are calling for shorter flying times to protect passenger safety. Organized by the European Cockpit Association (ECA), and the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF), protesters are demanding that European Union rules on flying times are brought into line with scientific evidence. The Moebus Report -- mandated by the EU in September 2008 -- recommends that an airline crew should not operate for more than 13 hours during the day and 10 hours at night. Current EU rules stipulate pilots work up to a maximum of 14 hours during the day and nearly 12 hours at night. Are you concerned at the hours worked by airline pilots? Tell us. Speaking from one of the protests outside the European Parliament in Brussels, Captain Martin Chalk, President of the ECA told CNN: \"At the moment, the EU level is not adequate. That's not our view that is the view of experts employed to review the EU's own level of protection.\" Chalk said that despite being in possession of the report, the EU completely ignored the recommendations when they produced new fatigue proposals in January 2009. The ECA and the ETF have printed over 100,000 dummy airline tickets which they will hand out to airline passengers. The tickets contain cigarette-style warnings giving details on crew fatigue and an explanation as to why the EU current legislation needs to be changed. \"All we are trying to do at this stage is raise public's awareness. We're not trying to get in anyone's way,\" Chalk said. Hundreds of protesters are attending events taking place at 22 airports across Europe. 400 ECA members are expected to attend the protests at Madrid airport. \"What we are saying today is that they need to listen to the safety review,\" Chalk said. \"It was conducted by the best scientists in this field in Europe. It was commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and therefore it should not be ignored when writing the rules.\" Francois Ballestero, Political Secretary of the ETF echoed Chalk's concerns. \"Flight safety is the core mission of every cabin crew member. But EU law is insufficient to ensure that air crew can perform their safety role in an alert and effective way,\" he said. But the EASA were critical of the protests and their timing. \"This is jumping the gun. It is not a constructive contribution to a debate which is yet to happen,\" Daniel Hoeltgen, EASA communications director told CNN. Hoeltgen believes that the pilots are simply setting up stall for an industrial debate between the unions and the airlines. \"It's got nothing to do with safety regulations. We have made it clear that we will invite the unions and the airlines to take part in a review of the current rules and the timeframe for that has been made clear.\" The current law in Europe on air crew fatigue is set at two different levels. There is a minimum level set by EU and then there is a level set by individual countries that can be better than that minimum level. In 2012 the EU level is due to come into force. \"There needs to be a change in the law to protect passengers and our members from the insidious effects of airport fatigue,\" Chalk said. The ECA represents over 38,000 pilots and flight engineers in 36 European countries."}]}

The 7-year-old was profoundly disabled because of his autism. Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family. In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling. Up until that point, Miller said, it was virtually impossible to get John involved with sports because of his condition. \"There were very few people who knew how to handle a disability as severe as John's,\" she said. \"Even teachers and professionals were unable to reach him.\" One area of difficulty was communication. John couldn't speak and was mainly unresponsive to people. And people distanced themselves when they saw the teen injure himself. John would bite his arms and hands and even hit himself with powerful blows to the head, Miller said. As John got older, his behavioral issues intensified. But while teachers and peers drew away, Hancock stood closer by his side. When John turned 12, Hancock introduced him to track at the Special Olympics. For the first three years, the pair just observed the sport by watching practices and events. Hancock worked daily with John, showing him everything, including where to sit, stand and walk, so he would understand the flow of the events. Eventually, the lessons clicked, and John was off doing 50-meter sprints. John was racing because he loved to run, not because he wanted to compete, Hancock explained. \"Winning is not in his vocabulary. We put him in smaller races so that he could finish,\" Hancock said. Finishing the races was a way to boost John's confidence. \"He learned that when he finished the race he could see his mom, and get a drink, and get hugs.\" But as John got older, he got stronger and faster. At 16, he was jumping hurdles and doing 800-meter races. Miller started seeing her son as a serious athlete. Off the field, John was closed off to the world, but on the track he shined. \"John's head will be down a lot when he is trying to have social interactions. But when he is running, his form is perfect,\" she said. John even verbalizes on the field, joyously yelling. \"It sounds like he is happy,\" Miller said. In May 2014, John's training brought him to the Special Olympics State Summer Games in Orlando. The 18-year-old was competing in the 800 meters and the 110-meter hurdles. As the 800 was setting up, Miller remembered, she pressed her face against the fence, anxiously waiting for John to compete. The lanes were filled and the runners took their positions. Miller's mind raced: Would John would be OK in front of hundreds of cheering spectators? Would he would trip? Would he even finish? But as soon as the race started, her fears melted away, and all Miller saw was an athlete, her athlete. \"I just wanted to see the best performance. It seemed much more significant than whether he would ever speak or respond to me,\" she said. John ended up winning the gold medal for the 800. Sports completely changed John, and Miller said that is because of Hancock. \"A person with a disability can feel hopeless and isolated, and I think that can happen to parents, too. Jeff probably saw that with us,\" Miller said, thinking back to when Hancock first met their family. \"John was never expected to be an athlete,\" Miller said. \"But if John could speak, he would say his coach always expected it.\""}]}

Now she's heading off to the championship match against a tough Japan team, a much-awaited contest set for Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany -- where the U.S. can win the tournament for a record third time. The 31-year-old Wambach, speaking to CNN in a phone interview on Thursday, bubbled with confidence, patriotism, and enthusiasm as the team bids to follow up its 1991 and 1999 successes. She thinks the United States can beat Japan, a team emboldened to score a victory for a nation wracked with tragedy this year after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the country. Who will star at the women's World Cup? Japan, she said, is a \"possession-oriented\" squad that's \"technical on the ball.\" \"We have to be patient. We're going to get chances and have moments where we can score goals, and I think physically we're going to be able to dominate them,\" she said. \"So, if we can take care of the chances that we get, put away goals early on.\" Wambach, according to her bio on the U.S. team website, has \"developed into one of the most dangerous goal scorers in the world\" and is \"one of the world's best players in the air\" -- as proven by her heading skills. The U.S. advanced to the final after defeating France 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. Wambach scored the second in the 79th minute with a dramatic header, her third goal of the tournament so far. And her last-gasp headed goal against Brazil on Sunday -- which got her an ESPN ESPY award for \"best play\" -- helped the U.S. level at 2-2 and take the quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, in which she also scored. Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? \"Some say maybe it was perfect timing for us,\" she said, noting she was humbled and honored by the ESPY award. \"We believe it's our destiny.\" People are gathering in sports bars to cheer on the U.S. team, and the American support for the World Cup team has thrilled the players. \"Pretty amazing,\" said Wambach. \"We really want to make everybody back home proud. We're going to keep this thing going. We have this huge game on Sunday and if we can all play well and keep giving our most and leave everything on the field, hopefully we'll come home as World Cup champs.\" Wambach was asked whether she will have another shot at a World Cup, which is played every four years. \"It's a good question but right now my focus is here (in Germany),\" she said. \"This team is special. And this team, I can't put my finger on what makes this team so special, but the fact is we just don't give up. We're not quitters. We won't give up for the entire 90 minutes that we play on Sunday. \"I think we can do this. I know that the players on my team, the coaches, the staff, we've all put so much time and effort into training and preparing for this. We're not going to let it go lightly. It's going to be a great match. I can't wait to start it and hopefully to see that we're champs at the end.\""}]}

Many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's new iPhone 5S, are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim. Now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime, with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal. Marc Rogers from San Francisco-based firm Lookout said: 'Fingerprints are not fool-proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases, we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well. 'Thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device,' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off. Scroll down for video . Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now' The Touch ID sensor is built into the . premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as . well as pay for shopping and apps automatically. Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Yet Rogers claims it shouldn't be used on its own. 'Unlocking . a device with a fingerprint, if done right, can be much more convenient . than entering a pin code multiple times a day.' 'So many users fail to enable [PINs] altogether and in this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code. 'And because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a PIN code or other secondary factor of authentication.' Apple announced that its iPhone 5S, pictured, has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button. Apple has stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse . Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. Users can 'train' their iPhone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire . crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Apple has also stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse. Paul Ducklin from Sophos Security agreed: 'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.' He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed 'short of getting medieval on your hands with acid, sandpaper or some other hardened-gangster technique.' Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset. Apple unveiled the fingerprint . scanner on its iPhone 5S on Tuesday with bold claims about its high . levels of encryption and security. The . firm even suggested that its Touch ID system could revolutionise . smartphone security and replace the traditional, everyday password. Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The share price ended at a . one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages . downgraded the stock. It is . thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, . especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at \u00a3469, . claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, . especially in emerging markets such as China. Analysts predicted that Apple would . be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China, and this . was bolstered by the fact Apple held a mirror event in Beijing, and . announced the iPhone 5S will also be made available in China at the same . time as other countries for the first time ever. Rivals including Samsung and Huawei do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce, so cost less. Around a third of the world's handsets . are sold in China to half a billion people, yet only 12 per cent of . these phones are made by Apple. Korean . rivals Samsung is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region, pictured right, . with Chinese brands including Huawei and Lenovo also popular. Apple . is still a popular choice in China, but predominantly with the Chinese . elite, and Carl Howe, vice president of Yankee Group's Consumer Research . group told ABC News: 'Rumor has [Apple] that they make more money in . any of the five stores in China than they do in the Fifth Avenue store . in New York.' Apple phones . in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly . salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for . example. The 5S is due . to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (\u00a3547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (\u00a3464) and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be . launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the . first time ever. Howe continued that . although China is Apple's second largest market, there is a large . percentage of the population that it is not able to attract. The phrase 'iPhone 5S' was the most . popular search term on Sina Weibo, China's most widely used social . network, on Wednesday, while 'iPhone 5C' didn't appear on the top . searches list. Users . questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a . smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5S model. Apple's . share of the China smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the . second quarter, according to research firm Canalys, behind not just . Samsung but also Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi Technology. 'Even . though Apple has a lower end iPhone now, its price is still considered . mid-end in China and not low-end,' said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based . analyst for Gartner. Around . half of China's smartphone shipments are in the 700-1,500 yuan range, . said Shen, but competing on those prices isn't an attractive prospect . for Apple. 'Considering . Apple's old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo . and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out . in market share in these key segments,' she said."}]}

For the aspirational, willing to bend their backs and broaden their minds, the materials for a dream house are all around us; in tin cans, tires and scrap metal, ready for construction projects anywhere from city centers to tropical islands at minimal expense. Cooler containers . High concept architects Infiniski of Spain have carved a niche in recycled construction that does not compromise on aesthetics. Their stylish designs are spreading through Europe, Asia and Latin America, with around 85% of the materials pre-used. The basic components are shipping containers supplemented with wooden pallets, which in addition to dramatically reducing cost, also have the benefit of providing a cooling effect in hot climates. Cano's Castle . Thousands of square meters of scrap aluminum came together for this towering complex in Colorado, courtesy of Donald 'Cano' Espinoza, a Native American veteran of the Vietnam War. Beer cans, hubcaps and window frames provide much of the raw material for four separate buildings, with four floors in the largest. Cano uses the gleaming site as a farm and reportedly does not encourage visitors. Save the Beach hotel . Launched in Madrid in 2010, the brainchild of German 'garbage artist' H.A. Schult -- who had also produced a whole army from trash. The hotel was constructed from the contents of landfills and beaches to highlight the environmental impact of waste. The rooms were fully disinfected to allow guests to sleep safely, and the hotel took an international tour to raise awareness. How to build your home from scratch for $35,000 . Don Justo's Cathedral . An astonishing labour of love, for over 50 years former monk and farmer Justo Gallego has been singlehandedly creating a cathedral close to Madrid, modeled on St Peter's basilica in Rome. Standing over 40 meters high, complete with cloisters, crypt and grand domes, the epic structure has been built entirely from discarded materials; broken bricks and tiles for the walls and oil drums for the columns. Despite working from 4am each day, 89-year-old Gallego may still require another decade to complete the project. Joyxee Island . British artist Richart 'Rishi' Sowa built himself one floating island in Mexico, but when that was destroyed by a hurricane, he replaced it with Joyxee. Measuring a spacious 20 meters in diameter, the island floats on 100,000 plastic bottles with cabins of recycled wood. Complete with beaches and waterfall, the island has become a popular tourist attraction as well as an extravagant home for Sowa. Home sweet homeless . Designer Gregory Kloehn re-purposed a New York dumpster into an apartment, featuring a separated kitchen, bathroom and sun deck. He then expanded the concept, accessorizing waste disposal units further with abandoned washing machine, bicycle tires and scrap wood, for as little as $30 a time. Several of these have been made available for the city's homeless community. Earthship Biotecture . Originating in New Mexico, the Earthship designers are now exporting their sustainable building principles as far afield as Malawi and Haiti. Steel-belted rubber provides the primary building component for the distinctively shaped off-grid structures, with interior walls composed of colored glass from reclaimed bottles. Energy is also harvested from the immediate environment at minimal cost. The company run courses across the world teaching their methods adapted to local resources. Would you live in a house made of sand and bacteria? Toothbrush house . An entirely recycled concept creation in the British city of Brighton draws on an imaginative range of construction materials. Thousands of toothbrushes and video tapes make up the wall insulation, bicycle tires hold the windows in place, with supporting roles for denim jeans and chalk waste. The \"house of waste\" will be monitored over a trial period to determine whether the design could be reproduced at scale. A place in the woods .

The reaction online was pretty much what you'd expect, with -- as The Next Web noted -- hashtags like \"Facebookmageddon\" and \"Facebocalypse\" common amongst Twitter users. So what happened, exactly? There was an issue with the Facebook Connect API that caused users on sites that use that API to redirect users to a Facebook error page. For example, if you were visiting Mashable and logged into our site using your Facebook account (and you were also signed into Facebook), you were automatically redirected to a Facebook error page. Exiting the page or attempting to re-access the original site would lead to another. Sites such as The Huffington Post, Kayak, Hulu, The Daily Dot, Pinterest and hundreds of others were all impacted. The bug lasted less than 10 minutes. In a statement, Facebook told Mashable: \"For a short period of time, there was a bug that redirected people logging in with Facebook from third party sites. The issue was quickly resolved and Login with Facebook is now working as usual.\" The bug may have been brief, but it has highlighted just how many important websites use Facebook Connect for user authentication. Over the span of just a few years, Facebook logins have become so pervasive that they are nearly second nature. It also shows that if Facebook has an issue, it can affect more than just its site -- it can also impact the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of sites that integrate with Facebook's APIs. What's interesting is that a user didn't even need to be performing the action for the error -- and hijacking -- to occur. Instead, simply being logged into both places (and having the accounts linked) was enough to force users off of a third-party website and onto Facebook's error page. \u00a9 2013 MASHABLE.com.

From former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to ex-England captain David Beckham it seems everyone is releasing autobiographies in a blaze of promotion and headline grabbing excerpts -- and all in time for Christmas. But whether the intention is to set the record straight, settle a few old scores or simply tell it like it is, the majority tend to live and die by their ghost writer. Trying to capture the authenticity of the subject's voice and cram the book full of interesting anecdotes can be a daunting task. But with the help of one respected author of several big football autobiographies, Ian Ridley, whose book on former England captain Tony Adams sold a million copies, here are 10 key components to a successful sporting tome. Story telling . Perhaps the most obvious commandment for any sporting book is that the subject matter has to be interesting. While a big name can usually be guaranteed to bring with them a loyal following who will buy whatever they release, the more casual observer needs a little more persuasion. Ridley's most famous subject was former England soccer captain Tony Adams, who famously battled alcohol addiction throughout the most successful parts of his career. Another focused on former footballer Steve Claridge's issues with betting while his most recent, on former English Premier League referee Mark Halsey dealt with his recovery from cancer. \"The subject of the book has to be honest about these things,\" Ridley told CNN. \"As a writer you have to press ever detail out of them and make sure you draw out the material.\" Capture the voice . Any book must bring the character to life in their own words -- it is no good having David Beckham hypothesizing over the French renaissance period. But get the ex-England captain talking about the influence of Alex Ferguson on his career or any of his famous 'hairdryer' moments and people will be gripped. \"You have to capture their voice,\" Ridley explains. \"Ghostwriting is much more of a skill than is recognized.\" One good example is the recent autobiography of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, entitled 'I am Zlatan', that manages to captures his supreme confidence. For instance, the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who continually refers to himself in the third person, notes: \"An injured Zlatan is a properly serious thing for any team.\" Mining the seam . The odd five minute chat here or there isn't going to cut it -- an author needs to live and breathe his subject for months if not years. That dictum is especially crucial if your sporting figure isn't particularly effusive at the outset -- as the relationship between the two grows so does the material. \"With the Adams book (the process) took about 18 months,\" Ridley said. \"Don't forget this was in the days before the Internet, which meant research was a lot more time consuming. Initially we did three months of interviews -- about 40 hours of tape.\" Lessen outside influences . Obviously, the publisher is king in the process but Ridley says it is important to keep their influence -- and pressure -- to a minimum. \"I have never been under pressure from a publisher and I have never extended a deadline,\" he said. \"As a journalist you are used to meeting deadlines and of course you don't get paid until you deliver the manuscript. \"I have never been told how to structure a book, though in the editing process they might come back and say we need more of this and we would have a discussion about that.\" Any publicity is good publicity . That old adage rings true even more than ever in the instant digital world of today. Despite huge chunks of Ferguson's books being reproduced -- much to the chagrin of his ghostwriter Paul Hayward -- it helped get the juicier bits of the text out in front of the public. \"You get worried they are ignoring the depth of the book,\" Ridley says. \"Such is the difficulty of selling books. But any publicity is good publicity. \"There isn't the bravery or the courage anymore in publishing especially with anything that isn't mainstream.\" Drown out the detractors . Any autobiography worth its weight is bound to offend someone or other -- the more the better in terms of publicity -- but it is important the author sticks to his guns. Ridley's book on Adams contained a plethora of sensational snippets from the footballer''s life, not all of them savory and saccharine. When the proofs were sent to David Dein -- then former vice-president of Adams' club Arsenal -- he was deeply unhappy says Ridley and was worried it painted the club in a bad light. But after pointing out the consequences to Dein of attempting to gag Adams, Ridley saw the ex-Arsenal vice-president's attitude completely change upon the book's publication. \"When the book was released Dein came over to me with a smile on his face and said it was flying off the shelves in the club shop. He was delighted.\" Get it serialized . Any self respecting autobiography must be trailed in a leading national newspaper to ensure maximum coverage ahead of its release. Not only does this help to prick the nation's consciousness it can provide some valuable income in a world where the digital market is shredding the publishing industry slowly and steadily. Serialization deals sometimes outweigh the advance for a book thanks to a lot of big names releasing books than turned out to be big duds. \"The publishing industry is in a mess in terms of the digital revolution, especially selling books in hard cover and paperback,\" Ridley said. \"Publishers have been burnt by ordinary sports books that were so dull, but that huge sums had been paid for. Now advances are very poor and you get what you can for serialization rights.\" Press the flesh . Despite smashing UK sales records by selling 115,547 in its first week of release and making \u00a31.4 million ($2.24m), Ferguson is still hitting the road for a series of speaking events to promote his autobiography. All but one of the six dates dotted around the UK have sold out and cost \u00a340 a ticket, which includes a signed copy of the book that is currently retailing at \u00a325 ($40). Not only does this help with sales but it also helps to keep Ferguson and his book in the public eye, with many newspapers -- both regional and national -- covering the events. Embrace the digital revolution . These days social media plays a huge role in the promotion of sports books with Twitter and Facebook campaigns an integral part of any launch. As part of Beckham's media blitz the public were invited to a 'global book signing' via the former Los Angeles Galaxy star's Facebook page, whch has 30.5 million 'likes.'. Fans from across the globe were able to get a personalized digital autograph on e-books from Beckham, during a session that included a question and answer section. \"I always like innovative and original ideas,\" said Beckham. \"What has been created is ambitious but it should be a fantastic event. \"I love the interaction with my fans, but not only will I be able to do this in London, I will be able to sign for them in locations across the world.\" Be determined . An extension of 'drowning out the detractors' includes a commitment to getting the book out on the streets in the first place. When Ridley and Halsey lost a publishing deal they determined to print it themselves -- in Lithuania. There followed three months of under-the-radar work that felt like the plot of a spy novel,\" Ridley said. \"For guns, read books. I was introduced to a middle man who ran the merchandise to printers in Lithuania.\" But the hard work has been worth it with Halsey's book garnering bags of column inches in the media and plenty of publicity. Ian Ridley is the author of Mark Halsey's autobiography Added Time: Surviving Cancer, Death Threats and the Premier League."}]}

In the end, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, who was not a party to the lawsuit, mediated the agreement, which gives the estate $2.5 million from the several companies involved. A federal judge had already ruled that Howard Mann and several associated companies violated Jackson's copyrights, which are controlled by his estate executors, and the only question for a jury was how much should be paid in damages. \"In light of the court's rulings for the estate on summary judgment, this settlement seems appropriate for all concerned,\" estate lawyers Howard Weitzman and Zia Modabber said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. Mann's company published Katherine Jackson's 150-page coffee table book \"Never Can Say Goodbye, The Katherine Jackson Story\" two years ago and established a website -- MichaelJacksonSecretVault.com -- that the estate argued illegally used Jackson's images and lyrics. \"This was a long, complex and difficult litigation that in the end will likely be equitable for Mrs. Jackson and the other parties involved,\" Mann said. \"This settlement would not have been possible without Perry Sanders (Katherine Jackson's lawyer), who worked to bridge quite a distance.\" \"I really really appreciated the reasonableness of all parties involved, and everyone is served well by getting this wrapped up,\" said Sanders, who helped mediate the settlement this week. The resolution of the dispute represents a new twist in the contentious relationship between the executors who control Michael Jackson's estate and the members of the Jackson family and some of their business associates. E-mails show promoter's doubts before Michael Jackson's death . Mann's involvement with the Jacksons began when he partnered with Henry Vaccaro, who bought a large amount of Jackson memorabilia purchased at an auction after Katherine and Joe Jackson's 1999 bankruptcy. A lien will be placed on those photos and other assets until a portion of the settlement is paid, a lawyer said. Katherine Jackson was not a defendant, but her name and those of her husband, Joe Jackson, and children Janet, Randy, Tito and Jermaine Jackson were on the defense witness list. The estate accused Mann of \"wholesale misappropriation\" of Michael Jackson copyrights and acting with \"arrogant disregard\" for the estate's rights by using unauthorized images . While the estate claimed the book sold about 25,000 copies for $1.5 million in the first two days, Mann's lawyers contended \"actual sales are very minimal and the defendant's businesses have suffered a major net loss.\" The copyright violations also included screen shots from the \"This Is It\" documentary about the singer's last days and other \"misappropriated\" images, including Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal Lean,\" which Mann's company used in its corporate logo. Mann's website, which the judge already ordered to be taken offline, \"does absolutely everything in its power to suggest to its visitors that it is the hub for all things Michael Jackson, and that it is sanctioned and supported by the estate, when in fact it is neither,\" the estate argued."}]}

The nine-page letter from Brussels to the Prime Minister says the scheme would break laws governing the free movement of goods. The Home Office proposal is to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers. 'Turn back': The European Commission warned Cameron that minimum pricing contravenes laws governing the free movement of goods . It will mean that wine cannot be sold for less than about \u00a34.05 a bottle, beer will be at least 90p a can and a stand-size bottle of vodka will cost at least \u00a311.70. The average family drinks bill will soar . by almost \u00a3100 a year under the Government\u2019s plan for minimum pricing . for alcohol, it was revealed last night. In the leaked letter, the European Commission advised the Treasury to increase duty on alcoholic drinks if it wishes to raise the price, the Scottish Daily Mail revealed. The Government appears to be ignoring the legal warning, however, and is forging ahead with the plan, claiming it will save hundreds of lives and millions of pounds of public money each year by cutting crime and . health problems linked to binge drinking. Wine-producing nations such as France, . Italy and Spain are planning to take Britain to court for breaching the . EU law on free trade. Research has found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off-licences and supermarkets cost less than 45p per unit \u2013 meaning their price will go up. Increase: An average family's drinks bill will rise by almost \u00a3100 if Government plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol . A couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around \u00a394 a year. The finding by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is a blow for the Government\u2019s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers. European officials have already written to Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, to warn that Scotland\u2019s 50p minimum price plan may contravene EU rules. The UK Government had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to Mr Salmond secret - now it emerges that they have had one of their own. Catherine Day, of the European Commission, explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits, and she said the plan would create \u2018market distortions\u2019. Miss Day said: \u2018The UK authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue.\u2019 The Government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent, and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000. There will be 700 fewer alcohol-linked deaths annually, according to the predictions. However, the IFS said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises, there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers. Those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise, because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p. The IFS research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all, because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway. Clash of opinion: Home Office minister Damian Green, right, said cheap alcohol contributes to 'harmful levels of drinking' while Catherine Day, left, of the European Commission, said the plan would create 'market distortions' In contrast, 72 per cent of the units . in lager sold in shops, 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per . cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be . affected. They found that . if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises, the . minimum price will simply transfer \u00a31.4billion from consumers to . off-licences and supermarkets. Miles Beale, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: \u2018Minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the UK, while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder. \u2018Alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country.\u2019 The report confirms that low-income families will see the largest increases in prices, because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol. And they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking. \u2018The most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy,\u2019 the report said. \u2018That will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is, and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about.\u2019 Home Office minister Damian Green told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u2018The evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking. It can\u2019t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p. \u2018Too many of us have seen city centres on a Friday and Saturday night often become a vision of hell. A lot of this is fuelled by very cheap, very strong alcohol.\u2019"}]}

Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal allegedly told a top executive at Columbia Pictures, which distributes the Bond films, that 'Idris should be the next bond'. It is latest piece of information to emerge from the Sony hacking scandal, which resulted in the cancelling of the Christmas Day release of The Interview. Scroll down for video . British actor Idris Elba, 42 (left), who has starred in The Wire and Luther, could replace Daniel Craig, 46, (right) as the next James Bond when his contract ends after the next film, if leaked Sony emails are to be believed . Hackers threatened 9/11-style terrorist attacks on cinemas showing the comedy about two journalists \u2013 played by actors James Franco and Seth Rogen \u2013 who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The federal government confirmed on Wednesday that North Korea was behind the massive hack of Sony, which saw thousands of internal emails  leaked. According to the Daily Beast, an email sent on January 4 from Ms Pascal to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, simply said: 'Idris should be the next bond (sic).' If Elba, from Hackney, east London, did follow in Daniel Craig's footsteps, he would become the first black James Bond. Previous actors to portray 007 on the big screen include Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. Many have voiced support for Elba to play the British spy, including actor Jamie Foxx who said in an interview earlier this year that he was a big fan of the idea. Elba himself has also previously expressed desire to play the British spy, telling website Reddit that he would take the role. 'Yes. if it was offered to me, absolutely,' he said. An email sent on January 4 from Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal (pictured) to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, allegedly said: 'Idris should be the next bond' The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Actor Daniel Craig, 46, has seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's  Secret Service MI6 headquarters . A Facebook group called 'We want Idris Elba for James Bond', which was set up before the leak, also has more than 30,000 likes. The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Spectre, which follows on from the 2002 release of Skyfall, will be released in the UK in November next year. Daniel Craig, who is in contract to play Bond for one more movie at Spectre, could be seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's famed Secret Service MI6 headquarters, last week. The Liverpudlian, 46, could also be seen stood in the window of an apartment in Notting Hill, west London, filming scenes for the 24th James Bond film. Spectre was announced on December 4 and stars including Monica Bellucci (Lucia Sciarra), Christoph Waltz (Oberhauser), and L\u00e9a Seydoux (Madeleine Swann) have all been confirmed for the movie. However, the announcement was not without hiccup. The Sony hacking resulted in the film's original scripts being leaked, forcing producers to rewrite the plot line and bring in additional writers to help make changes to the ending. The leak also revealed that Spectre has a budget of over $300 million, which is $50 million more than its predecessor. Pierce Brosnan played James Bond in four of the films from 1995 to 2002, including Die Another Day . If\u00a0Idris Elba did become the next actor to portray the British Spy, he would follow in the footsteps of Daniel Craig, Pierce\u00a0Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore, George Lazenby\u00a0and Sean Connery. Craig, 46, is set to play Bond in next year's release of Spectre. He has previously portrayed 007 in Skyfall\u00a0(2012), Quantum of Solace (2008) and Casino Royale (2006). Brosnan played the spy in Die Another Day (2002), The World Is Not Enough (1999), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and GoldenEye (1995). Dalton portrayed Bond in Licence to Kill (1989) and The Living Daylights (1987). Moore, the longest-serving Bond actor, played 007 in A View to a Kill (1985), Octopussy (1983), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Moonraker (1979), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) and Live and Let Die (1973).

The faulty lamp in Dronfield was fixed by council engineers after angry residents complained. Local resident Wendy Davies, 64, said: 'It\u2019s been shining into my house 24/7 for six years. What a waste of money over all that time. Wendy Davies stands underneath the street light that shone directly into her bedroom window 24 hours a day for six years before the council finally fixed it . 'I live in a semi-detached and the light would shine straight in to my bedroom window. I haven\u2019t been very well recently and when I\u2019d sit in the room and look out of the window all I could see was the bright light. 'It\u2019s been on for six solid years day and night.

Richard Schumacher, from Sheffield based company Pro Spark Connextions, estimated keeping the light going for six years would have cost about \u00a3920.

A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said: 'This was the first we heard about a problem with this light but an engineer has been out and fixed it. 'Although we carry out regular checks on street lighting at night, we need members of the public to report lights which are on at the wrong times so we can repair them.' The spokesman said the council looked after an 'enormous amount of lights' in the county and had 'never heard of' a light being faulty for so long. The Taxpayers Alliance director John O'Connell said: 'Unlike the streetlight, the council needs to switch on to the fact that taxpayers will no longer tolerate poor service.

Is it good health, education, income, or job satisfaction? Is it the environment, a lack of crime, or having a say in politics? Those aspects of life can't be measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), long used as a key indicator of a nation's prosperity, British Prime Minister David Cameron says. Thursday, he launched a national survey to ask people which aspects matter most to them, and which they believe should be used to measure the nation's well-being. Though Cameron has championed this initiative since at least 2006, when he was still leader of the opposition -- suggesting a focus on GWB, or \"general well-being\" -- he still defended the idea Thursday against suspicions \"that all this is a bit airy-fairy and impractical.\" \"Of course you can't capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it,\" he said in announcing the program. \"If anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human emotion into one snapshot statistic, I would be the first to roll my eyes, but that isn't what this is about. \"Just as the GDP figures don't give the full story of our economy's growth, but do give a useful indicator of where we're heading, so this new measure won't give the full story of our nation's well-being, but will give us a general picture of how life is improving.\" An online survey for individuals will run until April, when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will send out surveys to large households. The results of both will be collected and analyzed, with results to come out in 2012, the ONS said. Cameron said he knows some think the project is a \"distraction\" from the more urgent economic problems Britain must address, and that some think there is no way the government can hope to improve people's well-being. Getting the economy moving, and creating jobs and spreading opportunity, is still the government's most urgent priority, Cameron said -- but there need to be better ways than just GDP to assess the country's growth and progress. \"When a country is hit by an earthquake, that can increase GDP because of the extra spending on reconstruction afterwards,\" he said. \"When a city is torn apart by crime and disorder, that can increase GDP because of all the extra locks and security people buy. When a person falls seriously ill, that can increase GDP because the cost of buying drugs and paying for care counts as economic activity.\" Initiatives regarded as good for growth sometimes have negative effects on the quality of life, he said -- such as loose controls on immigration, which can affect public services, or cheap prices on alcohol that can lead to more incidents of crime. \"It's because of this fundamentally flawed approach that for decades Western societies have seen the line of GDP rising steadily upwards, but at the same time, levels of contentment have remained static or even fallen,\" Cameron said. Cameron said government can't legislate for fulfillment or satisfaction, but it can boost well-being by finding out what will improve lives and then acting on it. \"In time it will lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile,\" he said."}]}

And that often means clearing out the clutter that keeps us from functioning efficiently, whether we're at work or at home. Many employees -- whether they go to actual offices or do their jobs from home -- find the last week of the calendar year is ideal for sorting through e-mails, clearing their desks, and reorganizing their work spaces. Sorting through stuff is rarely fun, but those who tackle it now will find themselves a step ahead when their now-vacationing colleagues and clients come staggering back after the holidays. According to the National Association of Professional Organizers, which sponsors the annual \"Get Organized Month\" each January to help folks take control of their time, tasks and possessions, 83% of members polled say that \"paper organization\" ranks highest on their individual and corporate clients' to-do lists. For people taking time off between Christmas and New Year's, this week offers a chance to get things in order before 2013 arrives. Devoting time to both physically and mentally clearing out the \"old\" and embracing the \"new\" is about more than just getting rid of stuff. Being organized is really about being in control, says Susan Fleischman, a Chicago-based professional organizer, home stager and founder of clutterfree. \"As joyous as the holidays can be, the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's is probably one of the most stressful of the year for people,\" she says. That's why spending the week after Christmas decluttering \"really helps you recover and detox from the hustle and bustle of the holidays. \"It's very symbolic -- we're ramping up to the ultimate do-over. We all get to turn the calendar page and make a fresh start.\" For those at work, says Fleischman, \"the phone stops ringing, there are fewer meetings. Real work probably comes to a screeching halt. There are far fewer reasons to keep letting getting organized fall to the bottom of the to-do list.\" And these days, when employees often feel compelled to work harder and longer, being organized can be a real competitive advantage. NAPO Industry Member Director Mary Dykstra says that on average, Americans waste time amounting to between six and 12 weeks a year searching for things in their offices and homes. \"Just imagine if you could get out from under that clutter and spend that time helping your company build their business and ultimately, your career,\" says Fleischman, who was a public relations and marketing executive before launching her professional organizing business. \"Every minute counts when it comes to impressing the boss, your colleagues and clients. At work, we strive to project that we're knowledgeable, in control and experts. We're constantly accessing, sharing, reacting to information. Being able to put your hands on the information or generate some information means the better you'll be able to rise to the top and have clarity of thought and creativity and maximize productivity.\" But what about moving from work to the home front? Cynthia Ewer, the Washington state-based editor of OrganizedHome.com and the author of \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Organized Fast-Track,\" suggests we use this in-between-holidays week to step back and reflect on our habits and how well they're working for us at home. It's important to remember, says Ewer, that \"there are different personality types. \"Organized\" is what works for you. There are filers -- people who love folders. They want the serenity of knowing where things are. Pilers like to keep their eyes on their stuff. Deniers have bags of paperwork shoved into closets. Instead of using a \"What-does-it-look-like?\" yardstick, it's a \"How-will-it-work?\" question. Know yourself, and come up with solutions that reflect who you are, she says. After all, she says, \" 'It's here somewhere' is the most frustrating phrase in the English language.\" Cutting clutter also can boost the bottom line. \"How many times do you go to the store and buy the things you couldn't find?\" asks Fleischman. But cleaning up and cleaning out also can generate money, says Ewer. \"It can be a real fun process to turn your clutter into cash.\" Nab tax deductions by donating cleared-out items to nonprofit organizations. Declutterers can send usable books, DVDs, video games and music to third-party merchants in exchange for gift cards through the Amazon Trade-In Program. Even computer manufacturers like Apple offer gift cards to customers who send in an old iPhone, iPad or computer for reuse or recycling, if those devices still have monetary value. \"Leading an orderly life is about saving time, saving money, reducing stress,\" says Fleischman, who also blogs about organizing tips and clutter makeovers. \"And that's energy you can spend on leisure pursuits, which is very important to emotional well-being.\" Some tips for cutting through the workplace and home clutter this holiday week: . \u2022 Stockpile your supplies. Fleischman advises making sure you've got the right trash bins, shredders, file folders and markers at your fingertips before you start sorting and tossing. \u2022 Take it a zone at a time. Your office, home and car didn't become a mess overnight, so declutter in increments. Fleischman suggests starting with desktops, then floors, then moving on to file cabinets and bookcases. \u2022 Go from horizontal to vertical piles. If you're purging papers, clear those piles from your desk and the floor by placing newly sorted files in a cabinet or an upright vertical file. This way, your eyes can quickly scan and identify what you need at a glance. \u2022 Free up the fridge. \"Get the ghosts of Christmas past out of there -- all those little cans of this and that, the beef sticks from the gift basket no one can bear to throw out,\" says Ewer. Besides, this clean-up also will save you some calories. \u2022 Be realistic. If you really write out bills at the kitchen table and not in the home office, says Ewer, get yourself a wheeled cart you can roll where the work gets done. If your kids' toys actually live in the family room -- not in the bedroom toy box -- create a storage solution there. \"Look at your patterns of living and organize yourself accordingly.\""}]}

This tiny island nation sits in the middle of the Mediterranean, about 60 miles south of Sicily and 180 miles east of the African coast at Tunisia. The result is that anyone who was anyone visited, settled, invaded or conquered this prime piece of land. And with each leaving their mark, a visit to Malta is truly a journey through the region's history. The Republic of Malta is actually three islands. The country's name comes from the largest of the three; to the northwest of that is Gozo, and in between them is Comino. And tiny really means tiny. At only 122 square miles (316 square kilometers), the total area of the country is about one-tenth the size of Rhode Island, by far the smallest of the United States. London, New York, Tokyo -- each of these metropolitan areas is bigger than Malta. That compactness, coupled with an extensive bus system, lets you see the best of what it has to offer with ease. Begin your journey through the millennia with the stone temples at \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra, on the southern coast. Construction on these sites started around 3600 BC, making them centuries older than the best guesses we have for England's Stonehenge. And the temples are every bit as mysterious, since it is not clear how or why they were built. The structures aren't as massive as their English counterpart, and they lack the graceful symmetry. Yet walk among the exposed chambers -- with the sea just beyond the cliffs -- and you know that the generations who built these temples believed they were constructing something for the ages. It is here that you start to get a sense of what sets a journey to Malta apart from Europe's more visited travel destinations. \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra are just two of seven ancient temples that make up a UNESCO World Heritage site described by a leading prehistorian as \"the oldest free-standing monuments in the world.\" These sites represent just one epoch of many you will find on your trip. Travel seven miles (11 kilometers) to the east -- and skip forward more than 2,000 years from the time the stones for those temples were laid -- and you will be standing where the first seafaring Phoenicians arrived on Malta from the eastern end of the Mediterranean. To this day the village of Marsaxlokk is a key port for the country's fishing industry, seen in the market held every Sunday and in the seafood restaurants lining the harbor. But look closely at the colorfully painted traditional fishing boats known as luzzu bobbing gently on the water, and you can't help but notice how they are still painted with the Eye of Osiris, a custom said to have been handed down by the Phoenicians to ward off evil. From Marsaxlokk head northwest 10 miles (16 kilometers) inland toward the walled city of Mdina, which sits on one of the highest plateaus on the island. Just outside the main gate of this walled city is the Domus Romana, or \"Roman house.\" Here we have moved forward another thousand years to when Malta was part of the Roman Republic. The Roman House is a museum built on the excavated ruins of a nobleman's home, dating back to sometime shortly after 100 B.C. While the museum on the main floor houses a respectable collection of artifacts, it is the excavated floors of the villa -- among the finest mosaics uncovered anywhere in the former empire -- that will astonish you. As for Mdina itself, the city's name comes from the Arabic word simply meaning \"the city,\" which belies its status as the former capital of Malta. A millennium after our Roman nobleman walked across his tiled floors Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate -- a form of government based on the tenets of Islam -- that stretched across northern Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula. It was during this period that the moat and walls that surround Mdina were first constructed. With few vehicles permitted today inside its gates, a walk through the narrow stone alleys of Mdina makes it clear why it is known locally as \"the silent city.\" For one of the best views anywhere on Malta, make your way to the upper terrace of the Fontanella Tea Garden restaurant. On a clear day over a cup of coffee you can see practically the entire island. While the island nation has changed hands countless times over the ages, the influence that is most widely felt in Malta today didn't come from an invading empire, but from a group known as the Knights Hospitallers, later the Knights of Malta. This order was first set up to run a hospital in Jerusalem for pilgrims who traveled there and eventually developed into a religious and military order. When Islamic forces pushed them out in 1291, the Knights re-established themselves first in Cyprus and then in Rhodes before arriving on Malta in the 16th century. It was in those first decades on the island that the Knights of Malta built the current capital, Valletta, following an unsuccessful siege by Ottoman forces. With its impenetrable stone walls and regular battle towers surrounding a regular grid of streets, the entire city stands as tribute to the order's military and engineering prowess. Within the battlements, the interiors of churches such as St John's Co-Cathedral, completed in 1577, are among the most ornate that you will find anywhere. These monuments, like those reaching back into prehistory, outlasted both their creators and those who followed to lay their own claim to Malta. The Knights were forced out by the French, when Napoleon invaded in 1798, who were expelled a couple years later by the British. World War II saw a failed attempt by Axis powers to bomb the country into submission. Independence came in 1964. Today Malta, still as staunchly Catholic as it was under the Knights, is content to take its place as part of the European Union. A trip to Malta is not merely a walk through a living history book. Along the way are stunning natural formations, like the Blue Grotto on the southern coast near the village of \u017burrieq. When the weather permits and seas are not too choppy, boats take visitors to the 140-foot-high natural stone arch and surrounding caves. Of course, on an island this small you are never far from the coast, though sun seekers often head to the beaches of the northern resort of Mellie\u0127a to soak in the rays. The caf\u00e9s and wine bars of modern-day Valletta make you feel like you're in southern Italy, as will much of the cuisine. The nightlife at the clubs in St. Julian's, just north of Valletta, can hold its own against just about anything the rest of Europe has to offer. Prices for hotels and restaurants overall are less than on mainland Europe, especially in the off-season, and the bus system on Malta makes getting around simple and affordable. Full-day tickets are only \u20ac1.50 (about $2.) You can get pretty much anywhere from the main terminal just outside the Valletta city gate. No matter where you go and what you see, Malta's unique spot -- in the Mediterranean and in history -- is felt everywhere."}]}

A teenager was strangled to death by her scarf in a freak go-karting accident after being given no safety instructions before she took to the track, an inquest heard. Suzanne Cornwell, 18, was fatally injured when the garment got caught in the engine of her kart during an out-of-hours race in December 2009 - the first time she had ever tried the sport. An inquest into her death today in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Suzanne was one of six friends invited to the track by employee Andy Kivlin. Tragic: Suzanne Cornwell (above) was strangled to death after her scarf got caught in the engine of her go-kart, an inquest heard . But Mr Kivlin failed to give the novice driver any safety advice, or tell her to wear protective overalls and remove her scarf, which was standard practise for normal bookings at the track. After the accident, Mr Kivlin \u2018panicked\u2019 and told one of the group to\u00a0 cancel the 999 call, saying he would take her to hospital in his car, the hearing was told. The coroner also heard how Mr Kivlin had not been given permission by the owner to let his friends use the track. It also emerged another member of the group, Melissa Rees-Howell, who was Mr Kivlin\u2019s girlfriend at the time, had been told to remove her scarf by him on a previous out-of-hours session. 'Failure': An employee of Cambridgeshire Raceway (above) in Caxton did not give Suzanne any safety instructions before the out-of-hours race in December 2009, it was heard . Coroner David Morris heard evidence from Christopher Hamilton, who used to work at the raceway, that the DVD player used to show customers a safety film had broken and not been replaced. He said: 'If you saw anyone with long hair or baggy clothes you told them to tuck it in. It was the same with shoe laces. 'I felt I was thrown into the deep end. I wasn\u2019t given any training for the safety briefings and I didn\u2019t feel confident. 'About a month in, the DVD player broke and was not replaced, so all briefings had to be given verbally. 'I left because of the lack of pay and because I was being messed about. It wasn\u2019t well organised.' Rushed to hospital: Suzanne had been studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and living with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart when she died . Recalling the night, he said: 'I believed everyone had been karting before and was confident in what they were doing. Andy was the man in charge.' Cambridgeshire Raceway Volunteer manager Paul Shinn, who was Mr Kivlin's boss, told the inquest he had trusted him not to let people on the track out-of-hours. He said: 'Helmets are compulsory and . neck braces are optional to those over 16. Customers have to sign a . disclaimer before using the kart. 'If . you have a scarf on, you take it off. They would be told at reception, . at the briefing and if they still had it, I would take it off.' Mr Shinn described getting a phone call from Mr Kivlin on the night of Suzanne\u2019s death. He told the hearing: 'Andy told me he had f***** up. Andy sounded upset but not hysterical. 'I . rang Phil [the owner] and left a message with his wife. Phil spoke with . Andy on the phone. Phil told me we did not need to attend and I went . home. 'Andy did not have permission to have anybody on the course after hours. I have never known it to happen before.' He added: 'The only authority Andy had was over the track as a marshall when I was there and that is it. 'I remember saying to him you know you have lost your job. I was more gutted that I trusted him.' Suzanne, . from Hardwick, near Cambridge, was rushed to hospital after her scarf . got caught in the rear axle of her go-kart on December 11, 2009. Huntingdon Law Courts heard William Hitchcock called for an ambulance, but Mr Kivlin told him to cancel it. William said: 'Andy said stop calling them, I will take her in the car myself. I told the ambulance it was not needed. 'I think he was panicked about the situation and he did not want to get into any trouble. She had started to come round. 'I decided to call back. Suzi was getting clearly worse.' She died the next day in Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital. A post mortem carried out by Home Office Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift recorded the medical cause of death as ligature strangulation. Suzanne was studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and lived with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart. South Cambridgeshire District Council has been given until the end of October to complete a health and safety report into the incident. The inquest also heard staff at Cambridgeshire Raceway were paid a \u00a340 day rate cash-in-hand, but Coroner Morris ruled the running of the company was not a matter for the inquest. The inquest, which is expected to conclude tomorrow, was expected to hear from Suzanne\u2019s brother Stuart this afternoon. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}]}

Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease, a study has found. Women who did strenuous activity two to three times a week \u2013 enough to cause sweating or a fast heartbeat \u2013 were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems, stroke and blood clots than inactive women, researchers said. Those who did gentler exercise, such as walking, gardening or cycling, four to six times a week had the same reduction in their risk of heart disease. Indeed, doing any physical activity at all was found to lower risk by a certain amount, compared with being inactive. But surprisingly, getting active more than three times a week did not result in a further drop in risk. The chance of heart disease was no lower among the small proportion of women who did some strenuous activity more than three times a week than among those who did so two to three times. The Oxford University research, which is published in the journal Circulation, is based on data from more than a million UK women who took part in the Million Women Study, a major health project that was started in 1996. The latest analysis was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK. Lead author Dr Miranda Armstrong, a physical activity epidemiologist, said: \u2018Inactive middle-aged women should try to do some activity regularly. \u2018Positively, the research showed that every effort to be physically active could contribute to improving heart health. Women who were active two to three times a week were able to cut the risk of heart disease substantially.\u2019 The finding comes during the British Heart Foundation\u2019s Heart Month, when the charity is urging people to spend ten minutes each day making small lifestyle changes to improve their heart health. Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the BHF, said: \u2018This research reinforces evidence that you don\u2019t have to run marathons or spend hours at the gym to improve your heart health. Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease . \u2018Even if you don\u2019t have much time to spare, just a couple of weekly sessions to get your heart rate going can help to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.\u2019 Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, commented: \u2018This study shows how important physical activity is for your health \u2013 and it\u2019s not only your heart that stands to benefit. \u2018Even small amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk of breast, bowel and womb cancers. \u2018Being active in any way you can \u2013 even if it\u2019s just walking to the station or getting off the bus a few stops earlier \u2013 is a great thing for your overall health.\u2019 Britons are advised to do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity. But almost a third get less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, and one in ten does not manage to walk for more than five minutes at a time over a month. A can of sugary drink a day increases your risk of dying from heart disease by a third, health campaigners warn. They have unveiled a poster campaign to highlight the risks of drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which they say are linked to tooth decay and type 2 diabetes, while a can a day could lead to weight gain of over a stone in a year. The campaign, called GULP \u2013 Give Up Loving Pop \u2013 comes from the Health Equalities Group, based in Liverpool and funded by the NHS and local authorities. Director Robin Ireland said: \u2018Few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health. . . We\u2019ve launched our GULP campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers.\u2019 Soft drinks are now the largest single source of sugar for teens and children aged four to ten. Many groups want a tax on the drinks to reduce consumption and fund health schemes. Recent research by the University of Liverpool suggests a 20p per litre tax in London alone could prevent 1,100 cancers, 6,300 cases of type 2 diabetes, and cut the number with heart disease and strokes by 4,300. Such a levy would add around 7p to the price of a standard can. The British Soft Drinks Association accused the campaign of \u2018scaremongering\u2019."}]}

Tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of MDMA contained in the party drug. In one case, the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two-and-a-half times the standard MDMA dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill. Scroll down for video . Tests carried out on drugs which were seized this summer show the purity of ecstasy is at its highest level for ten years (stock image) It comes after the number of deaths caused by ecstasy soared from eight in 2010 up to 43 in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. The perceived rise in purity has prompted the Warehouse Project in Manchester (WHP), one of the biggest clubs in the country, to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue. Sacha Lord, director of WHP, said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so, potentially sparking fatal consequences. While the club says it does not condone drug-taking, it has started warning about 'very high purity' drugs in circulation on its Twitter feed. Nick Bonnie, 30, died after unknowingly taking almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before visiting the Warehouse Project, Manchester . Mr Lord told the\u00a0Guardian: 'I would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much.' Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, who regularly tests drugs, says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of MDMA. In 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20-30mg. An 'acceptable' dose for an average-sized adult during one drug-taking session is 70-75mg, she says. Ms Measham said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug. Last year, WHP started warning customers of the dangers of PMA, a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of MDMA. Though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in September, about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on-site paramedics, mostly for drug-related issues. In an inquest earlier this month, the court heard how Prince's Trust worker Nick Bonnie, 30, died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning. He unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before entering the club, the coroner ruled. Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. Anne-Marie Cockburn has called for a change to UK drug policy, after her daughter Martha Fernback died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure. The average is around 58 per cent . Earlier this year, Anne-Marie Cockburn, the mother of 15-year-old Martha Fernback, who died in 2013, called for drugs to be legalised. Martha, from Oxford, had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure. The average street purity is 58 per cent. Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation. The Warehouse Project in Manchester (pictured) has started warning clubbers about the increased purity of ecstasy tablets . 'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford. He said: 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, ecstasy or MDMA. 'What is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is. So, as I say, this is a very stark warning of what can happen.'"}]}

Will\u2019s only six.\u2019 Mr Slatter said he explained the situation to Apple who agreed to a refund. Will\u2019s mother Nicola, 32, said: \u2018Will was really upset \u2013 he was about to reach Level 26 and fight the Dark Monster.\u2019 To reach the Dark Monster: Will used Mr Slatter's iTunes password to buy virtual food and coins costing up to \u00a370 each while playing . Play with 'real money': The game, Tiny Monsters, is free to download but 'premium currency' which buys game extras can be bought using real money . Earlier this year another six-year-old, Jake Sadler from Portsmouth, managed to spend \u00a31,000 of his parent\u2019s money buying 'pretend gold' to play the Zombie Takeover game - free to download - on his mother's iPad. Parents whose children have accidentally run up huge bills playing games on their iPhones could be in line for compensation from Apple . Similarly, his parents only became . aware of the charges when their bank\u2019s fraud team contacted them over . concerns with 'unusual activity' on their account. Mother Gemma Sadler then discovered Jake had managed to input the password to their debit card. She . said: 'We had no idea Jake even knew our password or how he'd even got . onto our card details. But then it dawned on us that the game he was . playing is linked to our iTunes account and our card is on that.\u2019 Parents . whose children have accidentally run up huge bills playing games on . their iPhones could be in line for compensation from Apple. Campaigners are awaiting the result of a U.S. court case in which a group of disgruntled parents are suing the company after their children\u2019s innocent game playing ended up costing a fortune. They accuse Apple of enticing children to spend money on iTunes. If the parents are successful, it could open the door for legal actions worldwide. Apple, which is worth more than \u00a3311billion, has repeatedly been criticised for allowing children to spend hundreds of pounds on games using their parents\u2019 iPhones."}]}

Undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. is the highest-earning American athlete for the second year in a row, according to a new ranking of sports moneymakers. The boxer is projected to make $90million in 2013, according to Sports Illustrated's annual list released on Wednesday. Miami Heat star LeBron James is a distant second at $56.5million. King of the ring: Undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. is the top-earning athlete in American sports, raking in an estimated $90,000,000 . Write caption here . Golden: Kobe Bryant, right, is projected to collect just under $47million, including endorsement deals . New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees vaults into the rankings at No. 3 at $47.8million, thanks to a new contract he signed before last season. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is fourth at just under $47million. Tiger Woods is fifth with $40.8million, his lowest spot since SI started the list in 2004. He was No. 1 through 2011. Woods, who is coming off a big win at the Player's Championship this weekend, is beginning to find his stride after battling injury and very public battle with a cheating scandal. But his overall value continues to decline, most likely due to the loss of several endorsement deals following the appearance of numerous mistresses across the country. Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year. Slipping: Tiger Woods was in fifth place on the list, his lowest spot since the rankings began in 2004. Until 2011, Woods was No. 1 each year . Next on the leaderboard: Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year . Injured, but making money: Alex Rodriguez, left, has not played all season but still made the top 10. Zach Greinke, right, broke his collarbone during a bench-clearing brawl after making just two starts in 2013 . Rounding out the top 10 are New York . Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Zach . Greinke, whose 2013 seasons have been marred by injuries. A-Rod has sat out the season so far while recovering from hip surgery, and is eying a return to baseball in mid-July. Greinke broke his collarbone in a bench-clearing brawl in April after making just two starts - and is expected to pitch tonight. Conspicuously absent from the list is Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who signed a six-year mega-deal in March that's worth $120.6million - making him the highest paid NFL player. Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco, who signed a $120.6million mega-deal in March, does not appear on the list despite being the highest paid athlete in the NFL - because . But Sports Illustrated left out players who signed big contracts after their respective seasons had ended. The top 50 include 25 baseball players, 13 basketball players and eight football players, with no female athletes for the fifth consecutive year. Only one athlete came from the sport of auto racing - Dale Earnhardt Jr. The team with the best representation is the Yankees, with five total players. The estimates combine salary, winnings and endorsements.

A French drinks company is launching a red wine that will have the edge on its competitors - by adding a dash of cola. In a break with tradition Rouge Sucette, French for red lollipop, is made from 75 per cent grapes with water, sugar and cola flavouring making up the remainder. Sure to horrify connoisseurs, it is designed to appeal to the younger 'Coke generation'. Winemakers fear that young people who drink endless spirits and mixers will be difficult to attract if they do not adapt to their sweet palette. The 9 per cent ABV blend is part of a . new range by Aquitaine-based firm Haussmann Famille. They also make fruity . Passion Fruit and Grape Fruit blends. The company recommends serving it ice-cold for the summer weather. It went on sale this week for 2.95 euros a bottle and is hoped to become a feature of French barbeques and summer drinks parties. Pauline Lacombe, Marketing Director of Haussmann Famille, said: 'The result is surprising; the balance between the bitterness of the wine and the sweetness of the cola is perfect.' 'We did a lot of research to elaborate the best recipe and the best mix between wine, water and the aroma. 'The packaging is fun, with a label in the shape of lollipop. 'This kind of product is more dedicated to young adults, and women. Inspiration: Rouge Sucette's bouquet will be flavourings of cola . Young fans: The French company is hoping a wine as sweet as cola will appeal to young drinkers who prefer spirits and mixers . 'We have worked closely with a lab in Bordeaux, specialised in aroma.' Despite having a reputation for their snobbish attitude to wine, the French themselves have actually embraced flavoured wines, drinking a predicted 30 million bottles in 2013. Cola wine could also be a big hit in Britain, as sugar consumption has increased by 31 per cent since 1990, with the average person consuming 700g of sugar a week."}]}

Star arrival: Jude Law was rushed into the Old Bailey to give evidence for the prosecution at the hacking trial in January . Jude Law was betrayed by a relative who sold information about his girlfriend\u2019s affair with Daniel Craig, a court heard yesterday. It was only during yesterday\u2019s proceedings that Law learned that the immediate family member was paid by the News of the World for details of the actor\u2019s showdown with the James Bond star after Craig\u2019s fling with Sienna Miller. In a dramatic moment at the Old Bailey, Law, 41, was handed a folded piece of paper containing the relative\u2019s name and was asked if he knew they had spoken to the newspaper in 2005. His voice cracked slightly as he said he had come to know about it several years later, but had not known they had been paid. \u2018I\u2019m confused about what you are saying,\u2019 he told Timothy Langdale, the QC defending former News of the World editor Andy Coulson in the phone hackling trial. \u2018Are you asking whether I was aware of people being paid to get information? I wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u2019 Asked when he first heard his relative had taken money from the tabloid, he replied: \u2018Today.\u2019 The father of four appeared shaken as he was asked if he knew that his relative and others around him were paid to talk to the tabloid. The relative was said to have sold details about Law\u2019s phone call to Craig, after he discovered the 007 actor\u2019s affair with his then girlfriend Miss Miller. In an angry transatlantic call, Law was said to have berated Craig and demanded he should tell his own girlfriend, film producer Satsuki Mitchell, about his infidelity. Law said he had known Craig for \u2018many, many years\u2019 before he learned of the affair, which was made public a month after the phone call in a News of the World front page headlined \u2018Sienna cheats on Jude\u2019. In an awkward courtroom exchange, he agreed he had called his fellow actor about the fling in 2005.Mr Langdale said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to ask you the detail but no doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?\u2019 Scroll down for video . Court drama: Jude Law was shocked when he was handed a piece of paper containing the name of a family member who had sold information about him . Stars: Jude Law and Sienna Miller were among the most famous couples in Britain but split in 2005 after the affair was revealed . Affair: The Old Bailey heard that Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, pictured together in Layer Cake, had a relationship and Jude Law called the James Bond star after he found out . Jude Law was asked about how the 2005 affair between Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig was revealed in the News of the World and if he knew a family member was secretly selling stories about him. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC (AE) to Jude Law (JL): 'When was the first time that you heard the suggestion that a member of your family had passed information to the News of the World for money?' JL: 'Today.' AE: 'Can you tell me when it was discovered a relative had been in conversation with the News of the World about this story?. JL: 'That was in the autumn of last year, Initially it was from the (hacking) investigation, and when - confronted is too strong a word - a conversation was had with the relative they came up and admitted it had gone on. 'Admitted is maybe too strong a word, but I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.' Timothy Langdale QC, (TL) defending Andy Coulson, asked Mr Law whether he knew about the affair in September 2005. TL: 'Were you aware there had been or was some sort of relationship between them?' JL: 'Yes, in and around that time, indeed I was.' TL: 'Did you telephone Daniel Craig and speak to him about it, at a time when he was in Baltimore? JL: 'Yes' TL: 'No doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?\u00a0 Did you make any reference to his then-girlfriend, somebody called Satsuki?' JL: 'I did, yeah. I do not remember if that was her name - Saski - more than likely, yes. We had known each other for many, many years, so the conversation took on all sorts of turns.' TL: 'You were not aware that a member of your immediate family was talking to the press, to the News of the World, about this story?'. JL: 'No I was not aware of that'. Mr Law was then handed a written note of the family member's name. AE: 'It was been suggested part of the tale of the phone call . to Daniel Craig came from sources close to you. Did you authorise that . exercise?' JL: 'No, in no way'. \u2018I . did, yeah,\u2019 the Oscar-nominated actor replied. \u2018We had known each other . many, many years so the conversation took all sorts of turns.\u2019 Mr . Langdale asked if Law had told Craig to tell his own girlfriend about . the fling. Law replied: \u2018I think that\u2019s correct, yes I think I did.\u2019 He . appeared disdainful when he was asked to look at the News of the World . article about the affair. Mr Langdale told him: \u2018I\u2019m not going to ask . you to read every word of it.\u2019 Law replied: \u2018I would rather not.\u2019 In . earlier evidence, Law described Miss Miller as \u2018a friend\u2019 who was his . girlfriend for several years after his 2003 divorce from actress Sadie . Frost. He said Miss Miller had been the one to tell him that one of his . entourage, a male employee, had been giving information about them to . the News of the World. But he said he was only told about his . relative\u2019s dealings with the paper by the police last year, and had . spoken to the family member then. He said: \u2018When a conversation was had . with the relative, they came and admitted what had gone on. \u2018But as I said before, I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.\u2019 The . family member was not named in court and their identity was only . revealed to two barristers and the judge. Mr Langdale said the . relative\u2019s identity should be protected because they were a confidential . journalistic source. A second piece of paper was also handed to Law, . containing the names of a publicist and the male employee who were said . to have been selling stories to the tabloid. He confirmed both names, . but added: \u2018I was never aware that any money had changed hands.\u2019 Law . said Press interest in his private life had increased dramatically . after his Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley in 2001 and the . subsequent breakdown of his marriage to Miss Frost. He said he had . suspected someone in his close circle was leaking information because . photographers apparently knew where he would be, even when he made . \u2018secret\u2019 arrangements for days out with his children. The jury has . heard he was the victim of phone hacking and was targeted by News of the . World private detective Glenn Mulcaire. Law said he was not surprised . to learn he had been hacked, as he had long believed someone had an . \u2018unhealthy\u2019 knowledge of his life. Coulson, 46, denies charges . relating to phone hacking at the News of the World and alleged corrupt . payments to officials. Six other defendants, including his predecessor . Rebekah Brooks, all deny charges against them. The jury has heard that . Mulcaire has pleaded guilty to conspiring to intercept voicemails. The trial continues. Evidence: Mr Law, right, told the court he was 'shocked' when shown how much detail News of the World hacker Glenn Mulcaire had accrued about him . On trial: Jude Law was giving evidence in the . case against News of the World management, including former editor Andy . Coulson, right .

An advance copy of the report, which is circulating among Security Council members, was obtained by CNN ahead of a Wednesday briefing on Syria to the council by Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan. The document outlines the efforts to implement a six-point plan that would impose a cease-fire and take measures to protect human rights, and admits that it has not worked. In some places, the levels of violence are even higher today than they were before an initial cease-fire attempt, the report says. Military: Shelling from Syria hits Lebanon . The 300-strong U.N. team in Syria, whose mission is to observe and help implement the plan, has been unable to do its work as envisioned because of present conditions, the document states. Last month, the United Nations announced that it was pulling back its unarmed monitors because of escalating violence. Opposition groups slammed the international body for the suspension of its work. The U.N. mission's role in Syria was based on the premise that there would be a cessation to the violence, and failing that, \"a calibration of effort in response to the situation on the ground would be appropriate,\" Ban writes. Basically, the three options Ban puts on the table are: withdrawing the U.N. team, increasing its size or adding armed protection for them; or retooling the mission of the current team. Ban elaborates the most on the idea to shift the strategy of the current U.N. team. The team could retain its military observer capability and continue its fact-finding work, but with a limited scope in light of the violence in Syria, the report says. In this scenario, the U.N. mission would move its personnel from the field back to Damascus, where it would focus on pushing forward the six-point plan to the Syrian government and the opposition. \"From a central hub in Damascus, the civilian component would continue liaison and dialogue with opposition and Government representatives in the provinces as security conditions allow,\" Ban writes. The other options -- withdrawal or augmentation of the force -- could have more negative consequences than good, the report concludes. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . Withdrawing from Syria would ensure the safety of the team, but it could signal a loss of confidence in the hopes of a cease-fire and leave the U.N. without a way to monitor progress, the report says. \"(Withdrawing) would likely precipitate a further blow to efforts to stabilize the situation on the ground, and render the prospect of a negotiated Syrian-led transition, as laid out by the Action Group, more difficult,\" Ban writes. Expanding the size of the mission, with or without armed protection, poses an \"unacceptably high\" security risk, given that there are no signs of the violence receding immediately, the report says. These options must be considered, Ban writes, because \"in spite of the best efforts of (the mission) to support the parties in the effort to de-escalate the crisis, there is not a cessation of violence, and the basic human rights whose protection is at the core of the (six-point) plan continue to be violated,\" the report says. According to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria, 71 people, including 10 defectors, were killed across the country. In fighting in Aleppo Province since Friday, four Syrian troops and one opposition fighter were killed, another group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Heavy fighting was reported in Idlib, where the town of Al-Tamani'a was shelled by forces who tried to raid it, the group said. Shelling was reported in several suburbs of Damascus. The state-run SANA news agency reported at least four different incidents where \"terrorist\" attacks were foiled by security forces throughout the country. According to the agency, more than 11 fighters it identified as \"terrorists\" were killed by security forces, and at least 10 vehicles, some with weapons inside, were destroyed. CNN cannot independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because access to Syria by international journalists has been severely curtailed.

The blasts included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods of the capital, most of them in Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. \"We are aware of multiple explosions in the Baghdad area with resultant casualties,\" the U.S. military said in response to a query from CNN. \"At this time, no request for [U.S. Forces - Iraq] support has been made but we are providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage over some of the explosion sites.\" A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Also Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. \"We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,\" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately.\" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had \"contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord.\" It said, \"the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.\" CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report."}]}

As politicians and cable news pundits spent the 16-day shutdown of . the federal government describing the apocalyptic scenario of the shutdown, the vast majority of ordinary citizens weren't . even phased by the fed being closed for business, according to a new survey. The Washington Post/ABC News survey, released Tuesday, finds that . 78-percent of those polled say they were not inconvenienced by the . shutdown at all. Of the 22-percent who said they were inconvenienced, 11-percent described their troubles as a 'minor inconvenience.' Barely missed: Only 11 percent of Americans say they were majorly inconvenienced by government shutdown . The survey was conducted October 17 through the 20th - after the shutdown had come to an end. The surveyors polled 1,002 adults, asking the question 'Were you . personally inconvenienced by the partial shutdown of the federal . government or not?' If a respondent answered yes, they were asked the followup question of 'was it a major inconvenience or a minor inconvenience?' Prior to the shutdown, the Associated Press explained how it would effect regular people, noting that it would have far-reaching consequences for some, but minimal impact on others. Deal: a deal to re-open the government was achieved on October 17 . AIR TRAVEL . Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport-screening staff would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules. Shutdown: The tourist trips to Alcatraz would stop running if the federal shutdown goes ahead on Monday . INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL . The . State Department would continue processing foreign applications for . visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to . finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue . to provide services to American citizens. BENEFIT PAYMENTS . Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out. FEDERAL COURTS . Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard. MAIL . Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running. Lunch is served: School students who qualify for free school lunches and breakfast will not go hungry even if the shutdown goes ahead this week . RECREATION . All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument. HEALTH . New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East. FOOD SAFETY . The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual. HEAD START . A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children. Safety first: Airport-screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority . FOOD ASSISTANCE . The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children. School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate. TAXES . Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well. LOANS . Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended. SCIENCE . NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted. HOMELAND SECURITY . The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications. MILITARY . The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed. PRISONS . All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed. VETERANS SERVICES . Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown. WORK SAFETY . Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger. Cultural abyss: The National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. would be one of many to close during a shutdown . The deal to re-open the government was reached on October 17. However, it is only temporary, and there potentially could be another government shutdown in coming months ."}]}

The particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist Leon Lederman reportedly wanted to call his book \"The Goddamn Particle.\" But he truncated that epithet to \"The God Particle,\" which may have helped elevate the particle's allure in popular culture. More: Why the 'God Particle' may be key to universe . Announcements by scientists about their analysis of data generated by trillions of particle collisions in the LHC, which is located beneath the Alps, drew avid applause at an eagerly awaited seminar in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass, one of the open questions in physicists' current understanding of the way the universe works. The researchers stressed the preliminary nature of the results they were announcing Wednesday. \"A more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the LHC provides the experiments with more data,\" the nuclear research organization, known as CERN, said in its statement. But despite the words of caution, the scientists' mood and many of their comments were brimming with enthusiasm about the potential scope of what they had discovered. \"It's hard not to get excited by these results,\" said Sergio Bertolucci, the research director at CERN. The announcements by the CERN researchers come two days after scientists in Illinois said they had crept closer to proving the existence of the Higgs boson but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion. The U.S.-based scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year. Fabiola Gianotti: The woman at the leading edge of physics . They passed the baton onto their counterparts using the LHC, which is much more powerful than the Tevatron. Located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, the LHC cost $10 billion and has been sending particles smashing together in 17-mile tunnel for the past 18 months. High speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists have been sifting through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. The elusive particle is part of a theory first proposed by physicist Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. Higgs boson is like... a Justin Bieber fan? The theory proposes that a so-called Higgs energy field exists everywhere in the universe. As particles zoom around in this field, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around the particles in varying numbers. Imagine the universe like a party. Relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed; more popular guests will attract groups of people (the Higgs bosons) who will then slow their movement through the room. The speed of particles moving through the Higgs field works much in the same way. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons -- and the more Higgs bosons a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. While finding the Higgs boson won't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works, it will fill in a huge hole in the Standard Model that has existed for more than 50 years, according to experts. \"The Higgs boson is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe,\" Martin Archer, a physicist at Imperial College in London, told CNN.

Manchester City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the European Champions League in what promises to be one of the most eagerly awaited contests in this year's competition. City, which has been in irrepressible form at home in the English Premier League and won at defending champion Bayern Munich last week, had failed to reach this stage in each of its previous two attempts. Now it will face a Barcelona side which has won the tournament on four occasions -- but director of football Txixi Beguiristain says City will not fear his former club. \"I think it will be a great match,\" he told City's official website. \"Ours is a team with a lot of confidence especially after winning against the champions in Munich -- that will give us a lot of confidence. Not just at home but away as well. \"We have to be confident because of the way we are playing. We are showing that we can score in all matches. This is important in the Champions League. \"We scored in Plzen, in Moscow, in Munich -- it should give us confidence to play against a team who have been champions many times. \"Our manager knows Barcelona perfectly because he managed in Spain for a long time. In this sense, we are confident. \"I think the text messages will be flying between Manchester and Barcelona now between Sergio and Lionel! If you want to win the Champions League you have to beat the biggest teams, Barcelona are one of the biggest teams.\" City has spent the past few years modeling itself on Barcelona -- now it is aiming to supplant it in Europe's top club competition. Under the management of Manuel Pellegrini, the former Villarreal and Real Madrid coach, City has progressed to the last 16 of the competition for the very first time. Backed by the riches of Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, City has used its financial muscle to lure those who enjoyed great success at Barcelona. Beguiristain worked at the Camp Nou from 2003-10 before joining City to work alongside Ferran Soriano, who joined following a spell with the Catalan club as vice-president. Only last January, Barcelona president Sandro Rosell accused City of trying to poach players and coaching staff from the Camp Nou. One former Barcelona player who is expected to star for City is Yaya Toure -- the midfielder who left for England in July 2010. The contest will also see City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero, who will hope to have recovered from a calf injury after being ruled out for up to a month, go up against international teammate Lionel Messi. And while neutrals will be salivating at the prospect of the two heavyweight giants going head-to-head, Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino says both teams would have rather avoided one another. \"City will not have wanted to play against Barcelona either,\" he told reporters. \"What we need to concentrate on is being in good shape when February comes around. We need to have a high level and sustain it. \"They are scoring goals with ease so we are not going to discover them now. We want to play well in the tie and obviously win it.\" Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich will take on Arsenal in a repeat of last season's clash at the same stage. Bayern triumphed 3-1 in north London before squeaking through to the quarterfinals on away goals following a 2-0 home defeat. Arsenal, which sits top of the Premier League despite Saturday's 6-3 defeat at Manchester City, will provide a tough test for Bayern, according to chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"They are the leaders in the Premier League and so we have been warned,\" he told reporters. \"A few months ago we lost to them in Munich. They are a very tough team.\" In 2012, Didier Drogba struck the winning penalty as Chelsea pulled off an unlikely Champions League triumph by defeating Bayern in the final in Munich. Now at Galatasaray, Drogba will return to Stamford Bridge to face his beloved Blues in what promises to be an emotional reunion. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had predicted that his side would be paired with the Turkish club, which defeated Juventus in a dramatic final group game to seal its place in the last 16. Real Madrid has been paired with German side Schalke, with Carlo Ancelotti's men still harboring ambitions of winning \"La Decima\" -- the club's 10th title. Real, which sits third in Spain, has not won the competition since 2002 and was beaten by Borussia Dortmund in last year's semifinal. Dortmund, which was beaten in last season's final by Bayern, will travel to Russia to take on Zenit St Petersburg in the first leg. Manchester United will be favorite to progress to the quarterfinal stage after being paired with Greek side Olympiakos. David Moyes' side, which finished top of its group despite unconvincing domestic form, last won the competition in 2008. Seven-time winner AC Milan has been handed a testing tie against Atletico Madrid. Milan, which has endured a dismal season in Serie A, will face an Atletico side sitting level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga. Elsewhere, French champion Paris Saint-Germain will travel to Bayer Leverkusen for its first leg tie. Last-16 draw: . Manchester City vs Barcelona . Olympiakos vs Manchester United . AC Milan vs Atletico Madrid . Bayer Leverkusen vs Paris Saint-Germain . Galatasaray vs Chelsea . Schalke vs Real Madrid . Zenit vs Borussia Dortmund . Arsenal vs Bayern Munich . Ties to be played February 18/19 and 25/26 with second leg games on 11, 12, 18, 19 March."}]}

He did not give specifics, but asked by Amanpour if there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, \"The reports I received say yes.\" Haiti is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption, Bellerive said. But, he said, illegal child trafficking is \"one of the biggest problems that we have.\" Many groups appear to be legitimate, \"but a lot of organizations -- they come and they say there were children on the streets. They're going to bring them to the [United] States,\" he said. Bellerive said he's trying to work with embassies in Port-au-Prince to protect Haiti's children from traffickers. \"Any child that is leaving the country has to be validated by the embassy under a list that they give me, with all the reports,\" he said. Speaking at his temporary headquarters in a police station near the Port-au-Prince Airport, Bellerive said the first thing Haitian officials seek to confirm is whether the children have adoption papers before they leave the country. In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday it is moving cautiously on the issue of adoptions from Haiti. \"We want to be sure that when a child has been identified, that due diligence has been done to make sure that this is truly an orphan child and not a child that actually has family,\" said State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley. \"Sometimes if you push too hard, too fast there can be unintended consequences. So we are being very, very careful.\" \"We respect the sovereignty of Haiti and their right to control the departure of Haitian children. So we think the system that has been established is working effectively. I know there is a perception out there of 'cut through the red tape.' But there are very good reasons we want to make sure this process works well,\" Crowley said. On the broader issue of Haitian children, Bellerive told Amanpour the government will reopen schools Monday in most of the country. He said there were particular problems in Port-au-Prince. \"We cannot open one school and not the other. But some of the schools want to operate right now. They say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly.\" Bellerive also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to Haiti before the rainy season begins in May. He said he didn't know where all the tents promised by aid agencies and governments are. \"We have reports that they've already sent 20,000 tents maybe, and 20,000 more are on the way. But yesterday, when we didn't see the tents and we didn't see any action to organize the shelters, the president himself asked to see the storage place and we only counted 3,500 tents.\" Bellerive said President Rene Preval asked for 200,000 tents to house between 400,000 and 500,000 people. \"We are very preoccupied about the consequences of all those people on the street, if it starts to rain.\" The prime minister also rejected criticism from within Haiti and overseas that his government needs to be more visible to the Haitian people. \"We are in charge. Frankly I don't understand what that position is that we are not visible,\" he said. \"I almost feel that I spend more time talking to radio, television, than I am working.\" \"I know it's part of my job and I have to communicate. But I really feel that I have spent too much time doing that.\" Bellerive also said he does not believe it's necessary to relocate the capital to another part of Haiti. \"I have to wait for technical and scientific evaluation, but from what I've heard until now, Port-au-Prince will stay there.\" \"Tokyo is still there, Los Angeles is still there. We just have to prepare a better constructed Port-au-Prince, a safer Port-au-Prince,\" he said. He also acknowledged the need for more transparency and new procedures to prevent corruption in Haiti. But he said 70 to 80 percent of the aid coming to the country right now does not go through the Haitian government. Bellerive said about 90 percent of American aid, for example, goes through non-governmental organizations. \"They are accountable to the American government, but not to the Haitian government,\" he said. The prime minister told Amanpour that he does not believe people overseas are helping Haiti out of a moral obligation. \"I believe it's a more pragmatic responsibility,\" he said. \"I believe Haiti could be an interesting market in the midterm. We are 10 million [people] here and it's a market.\""}]}

Commuters reacted with fury yesterday after the new rail minister declared that they enjoy \u2018fair fares for comfortable commuting\u2019 \u2013 on the same day they were warned of another inflation-busting rise in ticket prices. Claire Perry, facing accusations of shocking complacency, also insisted that high prices could be avoided by simply booking ahead. Yesterday it was revealed that next year\u2019s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent. Fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since David Cameron came to power in May 2010. But Miss Perry said: \u2018What we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers \u2013 who could be forgiven for saying: \u201cWhat on earth am I getting for these rises that I\u2019ve seen over the last decade?\u201d \u2013 start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting.\u2019 If Miss Perry \u2013 who regularly uses a car to get into work \u2013 takes the train from her constituency of Devizes, Wiltshire, she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of Pewsey into London. Her comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday. Phil Guichard, 47, a marketing director, said: \u2018I would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to Paddington. \u2018It\u2019s not comfortable at all. At peak times I\u2019m lucky to get a seat.\u2019 Julie Ward, 47, a nurse from near Maidenhead, said her experience was \u2018horrendous\u2019, but still costs \u00a3240 a month. She said: \u2018I find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service. \u2018I\u2019ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it\u2019s really like. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d call it comfortable then.\u2019 Another commuter, Iain Irvine, 51, said the transport minister needed \u2018a reality check\u2019 if she thought the railways offered good value for money. The company secretary, who gets a 5am train to keep down the \u00a3400 a month cost of his commute from Bristol to Paddington, said: \u2018The only reason I use the trains is because I have no choice. If they want us to pay more they need to improve the services. Commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to Victoria Station at Clapham Junction, south London . Rail fares will soar by up to 5.5% in January - and by an average of 3.5% - following this morning's announcement that RPI inflation was 2.5% in July . \u2018It\u2019s just not good enough. If the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check.\u2019 The annual increase in train fares is linked to July\u2019s inflation figure, published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, plus one percentage point. With the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month, this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in January 2015, although some increases could be even bigger. The Chancellor George Osborne could soften the blow, and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of RPI but no more. But in a BBC interview yesterday, Miss Perry dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 . When asked whether it was fair that a London to Manchester ticket can cost \u00a3160, she said this was \u2018only if you don\u2019t book in advance\u2019. In fact, the popular Trainline website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to Manchester Piccadilly costs \u00a3164 to travel today. If booked a fortnight in advance, it is only \u00a323 cheaper to travel at the same times. Questioned on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, she insisted: \u2018People don\u2019t just rock up to the station, like probably you and I do, and pay the maximum amount.\u2019 The proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes, minimal rises or even cuts in wages. For example, the cost of a season ticket to London for commuters from Brighton is expected to jump by around \u00a3150 a year to around \u00a34,455, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. This is the pressure group\u2019s estimate of what the cost will be \u2013 although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year\u2019s fares. Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: \u2018If your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary, or you\u2019re a part-time worker with no choice but to pay for a full-time fare, or you\u2019re stuck with creaking 30-year old diesel trains, or even if you\u2019d just like a seat in return for your \u00a35,000 season ticket, then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable.\u2019 Mary Creagh, Labour\u2019s transport spokesman, said: \u2018This is shocking complacency from yet another out-of-touch Tory. Many passengers facing inflation-busting fare rises don\u2019t even get a seat on their train to work, let alone \u201ccomfortable commuting\u201d. \u2018When you go through that every single day, the experience is not a good one.\u2019 Last night, the Department for Transport said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015, but a spokesman added that the department was \u2018looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard-working people\u2019."}]}

Strauss, 28, has battled a life-threatening addiction to methamphetamine - also known as crystal meth - and been homeless in the five years since her 2007 appearance on the programme. The troubled former star opened up to . TV's Dr Phil McGraw about her problems recently, prompting other ANTM . contestants to come forward with their own well-wishes and opinions.

The NTSB animation shows two planes nearly colliding at the San Francisco International Airport in May. The first animation shows a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and a United Airlines Airbus A320 coming within 230 feet of colliding on the runway at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida in July. The re-creation was based on radar and flight data recorder information from the planes involved. The animation includes audio from the air traffic controller, who can be heard yelling, \"Stop, stop, stop!\" to the United plane as the Delta aircraft attempts to land.  Watch animation, hear controller's pleas \u00bb . The second animation shows a May incident at San Francisco International Airport in California in which a Republic Airlines jet takes off, coming within 35 feet of a SkyWest Airlines commuter turboprop that has just landed. There were no injuries in either situation. The videos were shown Thursday during the NTSB's annual \"most wanted transportation safety improvements\" board meeting, where the agency reviews its greatest concerns in transportation safety. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that serious runway incursions were reduced by 25 percent in 2007, but the NTSB said much work remains on runway safety and systems to notify pilots when they are about to collide with another plane or vehicle. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker expressed frustration with the slow progress of implementing new technology, such as the use of a global positioning system-type procedure in cockpits that would help warn pilots of dangers on the runway. Rosenker told the NTSB-only panel, \"It is time to do something before we have to investigate an accident that is catastrophic.\" Among the most wanted transportation safety improvements cited on the NTSB's Web site are items to \"stop runway incursions/ground collisions of aircraft\" with the notations \"action needed by Federal Aviation Administration\" and \"unacceptable response.\" The site says systems the FAA has added to airports to warn air traffic controllers of potential collisions aren't \"sufficient.\" \"In recent incidents, [one system] did not alert controllers in time to be effective, and the situations were instead resolved by flight crew actions that sometimes bordered on heroics or just plain luck,\" the NTSB site says. \"Until there is a system in place to positively control ground movements of all aircraft, with direct warning to pilots, the potential for this type of disaster will continue to be high.\" Rosenker told Thursday's board gathering that \"this must be resolved.\" \"We've had this recommendation for a number of years -- too many number of years,\" he said. Other areas of NTSB concern include fuel tanks on airplanes, pilot and air traffic controller fatigue, and technologies that could help prevent automobile collisions. E-mail to a friend .

Congress' most serious gun-control effort in years passed the first step towards legalization on Thursday as the Senate pushed past conservatives' attempted blockade under the teary gaze of families of victims of December's Connecticut school shootings. The bipartisan 68-31 vote rebuffed an effort to keep debate from even starting, giving an early victory - and perhaps political momentum - to President Barack Obama and his gun control allies. Four months after 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown were killed, relatives watching the vote from a gallery overlooking the Senate floor dabbed at tears and clasped hands, some seeming to pray. Scroll down for video . In their honor: Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, and Jillian Soto, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto, spoke alongside senators after the new bill passed Congress . Emotional: Jillian Soto was surrounded by other parents and family members who lost relatives in the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many of whom have been pushing for stricter gun laws ever since . Emotional: Many of the Newtown relatives, including Jillian Soto, were present as they have pushed legislators to take action, specifically requiring background checks for all gun sales which was approved today . Even so, few supporters of the legislation are confident of victory. Several weeks of emotional, unpredictable Senate debate lie ahead, and a mix of gun-rights amendments, opposition from the National Rifle Association and skepticism from House Republican leaders leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress. Today the bill passed through the Senate with bi-partisan support. It still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives in Congress before becoming law, but if it is passed it will: . Foes of the proposed new restrictions say they would penalize law-abiding citizens and do nothing to curb gun violence. 'The hard work starts now,' said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democrat who brought the legislation to the floor for debate. Still, in a Congress marked by a notable lack of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, Thursday's vote was one of several displays of unusual rapport across party lines. Hoping to bring pressure on Congress to act on gun control, supporters of new restrictions have been demonstrating in Washington. They have erected a mock graveyard with thousands of crosses on the National Mall, symbolizing victims of gun violence. Starting in: Volunteer Martin Witchger begins putting some of the crosses in the lawn of the National Mall early Thursday morning hours before the background check bill passed its first hurdle in Congress . Big numbers: All told, there were 3,300 markers on the Mall as that is the number of people affected by gun violence in the U.S. since December 14, the date of the Newtown shooting . Making an impact: Gun control advocates set up a display of crosses and Stars of David on the National Mall as a mock cemetery to show how many people lose their lives to guns . The Senate's firearms bill would subject . nearly all gun buyers to background checks, add muscle to federal laws by . barring illicit firearm sales and provide slightly more money for school . safety measures. Excluded and facing near-certain defeat in upcoming votes were proposals to ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines - factors in the Newtown killings some other recent mass shootings. But keeping those provisions out of the current legislation did not mollify critics. Opponents said the remaining proposals were unwarranted intrusions on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, would be ignored by criminals and would do little to prevent future Newtowns. Obama's plans have received scant support from Republicans and many moderate Democrats, with many saying they prefer improvements in dealing with the mentally ill and stronger enforcement of existing laws. Hoping for momentum: Lori Haas, a mother who lost a relative to gun violence, is one of the many people who have been pushing for attention to be paid to the Sandy Hook relatives proposals . 'I'm not interested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the Sandy Hook shootings no real solutions that they seek,' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-leading Republican. Congress hasn't approved major gun restrictions since enacting an assault weapons ban 19 years ago, a prohibition that lawmakers let lapse after a decade. Some potential amendments could broaden gun rights and weaken supporters' backing for the overall bill. One proposal is by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Mark Begich who say it would improve how the federal background check system blocks weapons from going to people with certain mental problems, though critics say it would make it harder in some cases to do so. Another possible amendment would require states to recognize permits for carrying concealed weapons issued by other states. In Thursday's vote, 50 Democrats and 2 Democratic-leaning independents were joined by 16 Republicans in voting to begin debate on the legislation. Support: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer from New York has been one of the strongest advocates for pushing through the more strict gun control laws . Proximity: New York's Schumer was joined alongside Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal when he addressed the press and the Newtown relatives . Twenty-nine Republicans and two Democrats facing re-election next year in GOP-leaning states voted 'no' - Alaska's Begich and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. After the roll call, Obama spoke by phone with some Newtown families and said he would 'keep fighting for the votes they deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney. The Senate plans to debate an amendment Tuesday expanding background checks less broadly than the overall legislation would. Broadening the system to cover more transactions is the heart of the current effort on guns. That amendment, a compromise between Republican Senator Patrick Toomey and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin would subject buyers in commercial settings like gun shows and the Internet to the checks but exempt non-commercial transactions like sales between friends and relatives. Reaching out: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia met with Newtown in his office. He was one of the leaders on the background check bill that was approved in Congress today . That accord, unveiled Wednesday, was designed to build bipartisan support for the legislation and seemed likely to do so. Toomey and Manchin are among the most conservative members of their parties and are both gun owners with NRA ratings of A, which is the highest that the gun lobbyist awards. Toomey said Thursday he believes supporters of his compromise with Manchin would be able to beat back any filibuster attempt. 'Beyond that, I just don't know yet,' he said on 'CBS This Morning.' Gun-control . groups have embraced the Manchin-Toomey compromise with varying degrees . of enthusiasm, and they continued to applaud it on Thursday - while . also expressing concerns about some provisions. Possible roadblock: Skepticism from House Republican leaders like House Speaker John Boehner leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress . Besides the exemption for private sales, gun control advocates expressed displeasure with language letting gun dealers sell handguns to out-of-state customers, exempting some holders of permits for concealed weapons from background checks and shielding individuals who sell guns from some negligence lawsuits. 'We are optimistic that this bill will make a dramatic difference in reducing gun violence,' said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The NRA said it opposed the Manchin-Toomey compromise and warned senators that it would count votes on provisions it opposes in its evaluation of candidates that it provides its members, who the organization says number nearly 5 million."}]}

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk because authorities are failing to protect the marine park by approving the dumping of dredge spoil from Abbot Point coal port, a former government official says . It's a decision that should not have been made, according to Mr Day, and is part of an ABC Four Corners investigation on Monday. Scientists and senior officials within the authority faced a tense year-long struggle against the proposal, with fears about the effect the spoil could have on the marine park. 'The big question is why was it allowed to be approved,' Four Corners reporter Marian Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The official view from the Environment Minister (Greg Hunt) is that they've put tougher environmental conditions on so they believe it can be done safely. But there's a lot of questions among experts inside and outside the agency about it.'

Mr Day, who resigned from the authority last month, says alternatives to sea dumping for Abbot Point weren't properly considered. 'If we take that into account and if we did a proper evaluation of all the alternatives, that decision would not have been made,' he said. 'Our own legislative mandate says \"the long-term protection and conservation of the values\", and we're not doing that.'

Mr Hunt, the federal environment minister who approved the dumping, told the program that Abbot Point was a 'line in the sand' and he has guaranteed that no further dumping will take place in the marine park under his watch.

Police have launched a triple murder investigation with a 55-strong team of officers working on the case. The fire broke out in the living room of the flat at around 5.10am on July 24 and quickly spread. Strathclyde Police said the building had just one door and the family became trapped by the flames. The heat of the blaze caused a downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around the front door of the property in Scott Court. Mr Sharkey Senior was seen hanging out of the window and shouting for help. His son was found dead at the scene. The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where Bridget died a short time later.

Retired Marine Gen. James 'Hoss' Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been told he is a target of the probe which investigates who leaked the source of the Stuxnet virus, NBC News and The Washington Post reported Thursday. A 'target' is someone a prosecutor or grand jury has substantial evidence linking to a crime and who is likely to be charged. Investigation: Retired General James E. Cartwright, pictured while serving as the vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, is under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information about a covert cyber attack on Iran's nuclear facilities . The Justice Department referred . questions to the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, where a . spokeswoman, Marcia Murphy, declined to comment. The investigation of the leak about the Iran cyber attack is one of a number of national security leak investigations that have been started by the Obama administration, including ones involving The Associated Press and Fox News. In June 2012, the New York Times reported that Cartwright was a crucial player in the cyber operation called Olympic Games, started under President George W. Bush. Bush reportedly advised President Barack Obama to preserve Olympic Games. According to the Times, Obama ordered the cyber attacks sped up, and in 2010 an attack using a computer virus called Stuxnet temporarily disabled 1,000 centrifuges that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium. Congressional leaders demanded a criminal probe into who leaked the information, and Obama said he had zero tolerance for such leaks. Republicans said senior administration officials had leaked the details to bolster the president's national security credentials during the 2012 campaign. U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured during his visit to Senegal, has said he has 'zero tolerance' for security leaks . The Times said Cartwright was one of the crucial players who had to break the news to Obama and Vice President Joe Biden that Stuxnet at one point had escaped onto the Internet. An element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a programming error that allowed it to escape Iran's Natanz plant and sent it out on the Internet, the Times reported. After the worm escaped onto the Internet, top administration officials met to consider whether the program had been fatally compromised. Obama asked if the program should continue, and after hearing the advice of top advisers, decided to proceed. Cartwright, a four-star general, was cleared in February 2011 of misconduct involving a young aide. An anonymous accuser had claimed Cartwright acted inappropriately during a 2009 overseas trip on which the aide traveled as a military assistant. Several sources confirmed that the former aide was a young woman. The Pentagon inspector general quickly cleared Cartwright of the most serious allegations, which involved claims that he may have had an improper physical relationship with the woman. The report did find that Cartwright mishandled an incident in which the aide, drunk and visibly upset, visited his Tbilisi, Georgia, hotel room alone and either passed out or fell asleep on a bench at the foot of his bed. Cartwright denied any impropriety and was later cleared of all wrongdoing.

Carl Muggli, 51, entered a guilty plea in an International Falls, Minnesota, court yesterday in the November 2010 death of wife Linda Muggli, who died under the weight of a massive totem pole. Muggli had originally claimed that the 17-foot totem pole fell on his wife by accident while his back was turned . Together: Carl Muggli admitted on Wednesday that he killed wife Linda by dropping a 2,900-pound wooden pole on her as they carved it together at their country home . But his story began to unravel when an anonymous tipster came forward with 'intimate' Facebook messages that Muggle had exchanged with a woman in Alabama in the days before and after his wife's death. In the string of messages, he tells the . mistress - who has only been identified as 'MLG' - that he loved her and wanted to . move in with her. And on the day before the murder, he . wrote to the other woman: 'I want us together to live our lives as we seek... I am yours. We are one!' Other correspondences found on Muggli's computer showed that he was looking to buy or lease a house in Texas to share with the woman. Busted: Carl Muggli was arrested seven months after his wife's death . Police were also skeptical of Muggli's story when their attempts to recreate the 'accident' were unsuccessful. Five times the detectives arranged . the pole in the way that Muggli had said, but they could not get it to . fall in the way that he claimed. They . also found that the totem pole in question had been 'stained or . polyurethane-coated,' implying that there was an attempt to cover up . evidence. After his guilty plea was entered, Muggli's attorney, Charles Hawkins, told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper: 'This whole thing is a tragic occurrence... He did not want to put the family, his family or himself through any more misery.' He will be sentenced on February 4. Muggli and his wife, who was 61 when she died, became famous for carving three totem poles that were used in the Indian Village section of Princess Diana's Memorial Children's Park in Kensington Gardens, London. They had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside Voyageurs National Park, in Ray, Minnesota. Their totem poles ranged from 16 feet to 50 feet tall. According to a complaint filed by the Koochiching County Attorney, police arrived on the scene to find the giant carving across her chest and blood pouring from underneath her. She was taken to a nearby hospital but died of her injuries on November 26, 2010. In an interview with reporters soon after Muggli claimed: 'The totem we were working on was progressing wonderful. Creative duo: Carl and Linda Muggli had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside Voyageurs National Park, in Ray, Minnesota . 'I mean, it was just coming really good, and we were laughing and joking and having a great conversation, just\u2026and then it was over.' Muggli was arrested in Stockdale, .

Scroll down for video . Ryan Hand could not believe it when Ryanair thought his tweet was genuine . Within two minutes of sending the tweet, Ryanair responded with the question: 'Hi Ryan, which airport is this happening at?

The presenter and comedian wrote: 'I can't believe Ryanair have just fallen for this joke LOL retweet!!!' The tweet was immediately picked up by his followers and has been retweeted 1,100 times and 'favourited' 689 times. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is normally known for having a sense of humour . But it seems Ryanair's sense of humour returned quickly enough. When asked for comment about the incident, a spokesperson said: 'As the fastest responding airline on Twitter in Europe, we pride ourselves on the speed of our customer service. Comedian Ryan Hand posted the joke on Twitter . 'We apologise for temporary technical difficulties with our sarcasm detector today.' Airline CEO Michael O'Leary is famed for his sense of humour, often joking about at press conferences. However, his outspoken manner, threatening all sorts of additional airline charges from a so-called fat tax to a fee for using the toilet, has seen the airline become increasingly unpopular with passengers. The joke Twitter conversation came as an 85-year-old grandmother really was left in tears at Stansted Airport after being refused travel for trying to travel to Edinburgh using a bus pass as identification. Helen Trotter, from Hawick, Roxburghshire, had used the permit to prove who she was on the outbound flight, however Swissport staff at Stansted - acting as third party agents for Ryanair - advised her that this form of ID was not acceptable for the return journey. A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'Customers flying domestically within the UK should travel with a passport or driving licence. In rare cases, where customers have no other form of ID, travel may be permitted with a bus pass. The airline launched a charm offensive last year in a bid to win over customers . 'We have asked our third party handling agent at Stansted (Swissport) to explain why this issue was not escalated and ensure it does not recur. 'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Trotter and transferred her free of charge onto the next available flight that day, however she chose not to travel. 'As a gesture of goodwill, we are offering Mrs Trotter a free return flight from Edinburgh to Stansted and hope she will fly with us once more.'"}]}

And he's not the only one. \"We've had interest from Las Vegas. We also had interest from Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the Netherlands,\" Ockels said. The 15 meter-long (50 feet) Superbus is a new spin on public transport that aims to match the speed and comfort of a train while offering the flexibility and convenience of the car. It has a top speed of 250 kph (155 mph) and Ockels envisions it running on a dedicated highway. But it's not just high-speed transport from A to B, Ockels says -- the Superbus can also use normal roads at normal speeds. What's more, it's powered by electricity, which was central to the vision of its chief designer Antonia Terzi. \"What inspired me was the concept that it was a sustainable, new type of transport,\" Terzi said. \"Public transport has to be exciting. You want to say 'well, I have a car but today I'm going to take the Superbus instead,'\" she added. A former Formula One aerodynamicist, Terzi has incorporated hydraulic cylinders in the design so that the car can sit just 7cm off the ground when traveling at high speed, rising to a height of 43cm when it uses normal roads in towns and cities. Rear-wheel steering helps the Superbus achieve a 24-meter turning circle, going easily around a roundabout, says Terzi. After taking a ride earlier this month, 61-year-old Branson commented on his blog that he thinks the Superbus could take on the train business one day, matching it for speed while trumping its convenience by dropping commuters off at their front door. Ockels says he wanted to create something sexy, and something that makes you feel powerful when you are inside, but most of all something that could compete with the car. He hopes to have the vehicle on the roads within five years."}]}

An armour manufacturer has developed a whiteboard that doubles as a bulletproof shield, aimed at protecting children in the classroom. Inventor George Tunis was driven to create the board in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut last year, in which 27 people were killed. The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range. Scroll down for video . Bulletproof: A bulletproof whiteboard has been developed by defence suppliers Hardwire for use in schools, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre . Protection: The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range without it ricocheting . They are also less dense than water, meaning the armour can float. The inventor hopes the boards can initially operate as teaching tools, but will be able to cover the head and torso in emergency situations. Referring to shooting incidents at schools, Mr Tunis, said: 'It's something I don't think any American can tolerate anymore, and we're in a position to do something about it.' The CEO of company Hardwire, added: 'I was like: alright, let's take everything we got, see what we can throw at this problem, figure out an innovative solution. The boards, which weigh 1.7kg, have three rubberised handles on the back, allowing it to be held in front of the body. The white boards are similar to Hardwire's Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle technology, which is used to protect military convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan. Strong: A closeup of the board after ballistic testing shows how the bullets have been blocked by the shield . The armor . is created from polyethylene-based textile called . Dyneema. Mr Tunis said the boards could buy children and teachers time before the police arrive in possible emergency situations, acting as a last line of defence. He said: 'As teachers are doing their daily lesson plans, it's in their hands. And if there's a crisis, it's in their hands. 'Teachers are not first responders, but sometimes they're thrust into that role.' Raft: The company says the boards, which can be used to rush attackers, are also able to float as they are less dense than water . The inventor donated 90 of the products, valued at $20,000 (\u00a312,600) to Worcester Preparatory School, where his children are schooled.

Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma after he decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his hair. He remained in hospital for almost a year following the accident on July 22, 2013, near the seaside village of Chapel Saint Leonards, Lincolnshire. Scroll down for video .

It was a beautiful moment' At the time, Ryan\u2019s father, Mark, released a heart-breaking image of him cradling his son as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets. The family were told by doctors that Ryan would probably not survive and even if he did, he would be severely disabled. But in November last year they were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time after he came out of a four-month coma. And in April, the family reached another milestone when he defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children\u2019s Trust Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey. Today, Mr Smith, 44, told how his son had incredibly taken his first steps unaided in a special hydrotherapy pool on Sunday, just in time for Father Day. He said: \u2018We are just so amazed. Ryan (pictured before his injury) was knocked off his bike by a van. He had not been wearing a helmet over fears it would spoil his hair style . Ryan (pictured with his father, Mark, shortly after the accident) spent four months in a coma and doctors warned his parents he probably wouldn't survive as his head injuries were so severe . \u2018There is a very long way to go but to be told at the time that he would not survive, to him standing and walking on his own, is incredible. \u2018It was a beautiful moment and bizarrely it happened by complete accident really. \u2018He was in the pool with two supportive floats which then slipped out from under him. \u2018But rather than letting himself sink, he placed his feet on the ground and took a couple of steps. \u2018So we thought we\u2019d try and see how far he could get - and amazingly he walked the entire width of the swimming pool. \u2018We were told even if he survived he would not be able to do anything for himself. But now he is talking, eating and drinking all by himself. \u2018He still has problems with his short-term memory but can hold conversations with people now. The steps he is taking are superb, but it is a slow and long process. \u2018Ryan has had a fantastic amount of love and support around him and I cannot stress enough how integral that is for the recovery of people who have suffered brain injuries.\u2019 The Smith family are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear helmets. Ryan (pictured while he was in a coma) spoke for the first time since the accident in November last year and stood up for the first time in April this year .

A Taliban suicide bomber tried to assassinate Afghan politician Asadullah Khalid by hiding an explosive inside his body, it has been revealed. According to the New York Times, security officials were stumped as to how the attacker managed to blow himself up after he was put through rigorous security checks including a strip search. The body-cavity suicide bomb injured Mr Khalid, who is being treated for serious wounds to his hands, arms and abdomen six months on from the blast. The bomber, who posed as a peace messenger, crossed into Afghanistan from Pakistan to deliver information to Mr Khalid in person last December. He was screened in the armoured room of a guesthouse in Kabul by security guards - a measure that is used to reduce the risk of attack. Mr Khalid's aides questioned the agent and forced him to strip naked to make sure he was not concealing a weapon before he was taken to see the Intelligence Chief, said the New York Times. Officials had previously said the bomb was hidden in the attacker's underwear, but a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, Shafiqullah Tahiri, has confirmed a body-cavity bomb was used in the blast. Rectal bombs are said to be limited in their impact because the force of their blast is cushioned by the bomber's body. The attempted assassination last December came just three months after Mr Khlaid was appointed as Head of National Directorate of Security. The politician is a close ally of President Karzai and is known as being fiercely anti-Taliban. Mr Khalid has survived attempts on his life in the past. He was attacked by a suicide car bomber in 2007, who drove into his car. Right hand man: Asadullah Khalid is a close ally of Afghan President Hamid Karzai . Researcher Robert Bunker told the New York Times that body-cavity bombs are limited in their impact on targets. He said: 'There are some really practical limitations to what you can do with the . basic physics. 'You can only get so much in the body, and . there is no shrapnel effect. It\u2019s good news that these things have very limited lethality,' he said.

The world's best football player has been summoned to appear in a Spanish court over tax fraud allegations. Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Barcelona, will appear before a judge on September 17. The four-time World Player of . the Year has been accused of defrauding \u00a33.4million through false income tax returns in Spain. The state prosecutor has taken action against the footballer and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi. Both are accused of three offences against the public purse for allegedly defrauding millions on income tax returns for 2007, 2008 and 2009. The complaint, signed by prosecutor Raquel Amado, was previously submitted for trial at the court in Gava, the upmarket Barcelona suburb where the Argentina forward lives. A judge must accept the prosecutor's lawsuit before charges can be brought against Messi and his father. The footballing star released a statement denying any wrongdoing once the allegations emerged. Reports emerged last week alleging the four-time reigning World Player of the Year and his father, Jorge Horacio, were suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2007 and 2009. The 25-year-old swiftly insisted he had done nothing wrong in a statement on his official Facebook page. It read: 'We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities. 'We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement. Messi, pictured here with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo, issued a statement last week\u00a0 saying 'we have always fulfilled all our tax obligations' 'We have always fulfilled all our tax . obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take . care of clarifying this situation.'

Stern walked out of open prison HMP Leyhill, in Wotton-Under-Edge near Bristol, on September 26, Oxford Crown Court was told. Within a day, he walked up to the gates at Bullingdon in Arncott, Oxfordshire, and asked to be let in. Instead Stern, who was serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for the knifepoint robbery, was asked to sit on a grass verge for the police to arrive. Cathy Olliver, prosecuting, said he was transfered to the open prison from Bullingdon for good behaviour in August. But, Stern was unhappy at being so far away from his Oxford family and after failing to move to a much closer prison decided to escape. Peter Du Feu, defending, said that after escaping from prison in Bristol, his client was on the loose for 24 hours. He said he went to visit his partner and three children, before heading back to Bullingdon The barrister said: 'He knocked on the door and asked to be let back in. Where he wanted to be: Bullingdon, near his family in Oxford, is more than 70 miles from the prison he was in . Too far: Stern was moved to Leyhill in Bristol for good behaviour. But he said it was too far from his family . Sentenced: Stern had 21 days added to his sentence for robbing a betting shop but gets to stay where he wants . 'They said they couldn\u2019t possibly let him in, but could he sit on the verge and wait for the police. 'The nature of open prisons is to try to integrate prisoners back into the community, which clearly he couldn\u2019t do so far away. 'He was only free for 24 hours and then went back to Bullingdon. He has been there since.' Judge Mary Jane Mowat sentenced Stern of Blackbird Leys Road, Blackbird Leys, Oxford, to a further 21 days inside. She told Stern: 'Prisoners have got to obey the rules.'"}]}

Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis says he wants to enact reforms in response to the international financial crisis. He called the early elections in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if there was no general election first. Karamanlis is also seeking a mandate from the voters for reforms in response to the international financial crisis, he said. \"It's up to the citizens to decide who has the right plan to govern and face the economic challenges,\" he said in a speech to the country. \"We have two very difficult and critical years ahead of us,\" he said in the speech on Wednesday. \"There is only one path that offers hope and potential: We take -- without delay, without procrastination -- take all necessary measures to address these problems. By design and desire. We need to build the solid foundation that will ultimately get us out of this crisis stronger.\" He said the country needs \"stringent control on public spending,\" \"war on tax-evasion\" and \"bold structural reforms.\" The new elections will be held October 4, Karamanlis announced Thursday after meeting President Karolos Papoulias, who officially dissolves parliament. Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011. But Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February. The Greek constitution requires the two major parties to agree on the election of a president, giving either party an effective veto. Karamanlis called Papandreou's stance \"blackmail.\" Parliament will be dissolved on September 7, Karamanlis said on his Web site. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote. That election was seen as a litmus test for Karamanlis at a time of political and economic uncertainty with the economy shrinking and the country staring at a recession after nearly 15 years of high-profile growth.

A 10-year-old who had to have a kidney transplant after mistakes by doctors at a private hospital left him in renal failure, has today been awarded \u00a34.8 million in compensation. Lucas Tuppeny was born in January 2004 with a bowel defect, and required a colostomy, Judge Richard Parkes heard at London's High Court. A series of errors by medical staff at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington, London, resulted in Lucas suffering renal failure. It left the youngster needing dialysis from the age of six months. In October 2005 he received a kidney from his father, Brock, who works in the oil industry. Lucas, who lived in Ruislip, Middlesex, at the time but is now settled with his mother, Therese, in Seattle, in the U.S., has had 28 procedures with a total of 149 days in hospital. And he will need another transplant in the future, the court heard. In spite of his problems, Lucas is an\u00a0'enthusiastic, optimistic, energetic and very sociable little boy', Christopher Johnston QC said. Asked how he was feeling by the judge, Lucas stood and said 'Good, your Lordship', adding he would be having a holiday in the Bahamas before going back to school. The judge, who approved the settlement against the hospital, which admitted liability, said: 'I am delighted to hear it. 'It is lovely to see you and I would just like to wish you all the best for the future. 'You are very lucky in your mum and your dad.' Both the judge and the hospital's counsel, Jeremy Hyam, paid tribute to the outstanding care shown by Lucas's mother. The judge, who had seen a video about Lucas, told Mrs Tuppeny: 'What extraordinary devotion you have lavished on your son throughout these difficult years. 'I don't think anyone on the outside would know what is involved. 'One can only watch with huge respect what you and indeed your former husband have done. 'Having seen the video makes one realise what a splendid young man Lucas is and what potential he has, thanks to you.' London's High Court heard the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington admitted liability. Judge\u00a0Richard Parkes awarded Lucas's family \u00a34.8 million in compensation to pay for his medical costs and future loss of earnings . Alison Eddy, a partner with lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said outside court: 'It is a huge relief for his family that the hospital and medical staff who cared for him have now agreed an adequate and fair settlement to cover his care needs both now and in the future. 'This young boy has suffered a catalogue of medical issues throughout his childhood and will face numerous problems in his future as his condition deteriorates. 'We are pleased that we secured this settlement for him and his family, who now have the financial security and reassurance that costs for his future treatment will be met. 'We hope that lessons are learnt by the hospital and their staff so that patient safety in this situation can be improved and each and every patient receives the best quality of care at all times.' The damages will cover Lucas's medical and care costs and anticipated future loss of earnings. A spokesman for the Bupa Cromwell Hospital told MailOnline: 'We did not own the hospital in 2004. 'However, we are very sorry that Lucas suffered these problems and would again like to apologise to him and his family. 'We hope that this settlement will give Lucas and his parents the security of knowing that his future care and support needs can be met. 'We wish Lucas and his family well for the future.'"}]}

Investigators believe a $1.5 million life-insurance policy could have been the motive for a savage sledgehammer and knife attack on a New York City psychiatrist last year. Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on shrink Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office with the heavy weapon and a kitchen knife. But, just four days before the attack, Weiss had reluctantly changed the beneficiary on his hefty insurance policy to Nolan's aunt, fellow psychiatrist Pamela Buchbinder, 43, with whom Weiss shares a young son. Nolan was living with Buchbinder in her Chelsea home at the time of the attack. He is also the Godfather of the pair's child. Crime scene: Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on psychiatrist Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office, pictured, with the sledgehammer and a kitchen knife . 'The ink was still wet (on the policy) when Nolan attacked him,' Weiss' lawyer, Roland Acevedo, told The New York Post, which has obtained family-court records proving the change in beneficiary. 'It's like a \"20/20\" episode. It sure looks like his son's mother put Jake up to this for the insurance money.' According to the newspaper, the Manhattan district attorney's office is now looking closely at the possible link. Sources told The Post investigators were trying to determine whether Buchbinder was with Nolan when he purchased the sledgehammer from a Manhattan Home Deport store. Weapon: Nolan allegedly swung the sledgehammer at Weiss before stabbing him eight times with the knife (stock photo) They have also quizzed Weiss and requested a copy of the life-insurance policy, a police source said. 'The circumstances are suspicious, and we're looking into it,' the source told The Post. Weiss finally agreed to put Buchbinder's name on his insurance policy on November 8, 2012, after weeks of badgering, Acevedo said. In the morning on November 12, Nolan allegedly arrived at Weiss' midtown Manhattan office carrying a black duffel bag and an argument about paying for the six-year-old boy's education ensued. He then asked to go to the restroom and allegedly came out swinging the sledgehammer over Weiss's head as the psychiatrist hid at his desk. Nolan then pulled out a kitchen knife and proceeded to stab Weiss in his back and chest eight times, police said. The shrink managed to wrestle the knife off Nolan and strike him once before he escaped and begged for help. '(Weiss) crawled into the hallway covered in blood and screamed, \"Help me! Help me!\"' Acevedo said. Nolan was arrested and is now awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Nolan's lawyer Steven Brounstein declined to comment to MailOnline. MailOnline contacted Buchbinder but she didn't return a request for comment."}]}

Since April the Chancellor has borrowed more each month than the same time last year, with income and wealth taxes down. The Treasury had been expected to cut borrowing by 12 per cent in 2014-15, but experts said it was 'ever more unlikely' to meet to target. New figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show borrowing has been higher each month since April than the same time last year . New data from the Office for National Statistics borrowing in September, excluding the effects of bank bail-outs, was \u00a311.8 billion, \u00a31.6 billion ahead of the same month in 2013. It means that halfway through the financial year, the Treasury looks well behind the target for a 12 per cent fall in the annual deficit expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Total borrowing for April to September stands at \u00a358 billion, 10 per cent higher than for the same period in 2013-14. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The Government's current fiscal problems largely reflect the fact that much weaker-than-expected earnings growth has limited income tax receipts, along with a large number of people now being in low-paid jobs or self-employed. The figures are a blow for Chancellor George Osborne who hopes to go into the next election claiming borrowing is down . 'The Chancellor is looking ever more unlikely to meet his fiscal targets for 2014-15.' Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'These figures are a serious blow to George Osborne. 'Not only is he set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but borrowing in the first half of this year is now 10 per cent higher than the same period last year. 'As the OBR said last week, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing.' Taxes on income and wealth for September of \u00a313.1 billion were flat on the same month last year and just 0.6 per cent ahead for the year to date. Within this, revenues from income tax and capital gains tax rose 2.2 per cent for the month and 0.1 per cent for the year to date. OBR chairman Robert Chote has warned that the squeeze on pay growth is hitting the Government's revenues from income tax despite record numbers in work. Annual pay growth has been lagging behind inflation since 2008 and latest official figures showed it was just 0.7 per cent. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: 'The continued run of poor UK public borrowing figures looks set to severely hamper the Chancellor's ability to announce giveaways to address his party's deficit in the national opinion polls before next year's general election.' The ONS figures suggested that the buoyant property market was continuing to have a positive effect on public finances. Stamp duty on land and property continued to boost the Government's coffers, rising to \u00a31.1 billion for September, matching a high in July that was a seven-year record. Revenues from this were up \u00a31.5 billion, or 34 per cent, to \u00a35.9 billion for the April to September period. The Treasury hoped to cut borrowing to \u00a386.6billion in 2014-15, something which now looks increasingly unlikely . Total receipts were 3.1 per cent ahead to \u00a346 billion, though for the year to date they are 0.4 per cent behind at \u00a3287.1 billion. Spending for September rose by 3.7 per cent from \u00a351.1 billion to \u00a353 billion. Underlying public sector debt was \u00a31.451 trillion, or 79.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 79.2 per cent last month and 77.9 per cent in September last year. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today's figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances. 'At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's time for George Osborne to admit he got his strategy wrong. Today's figures show the deficit getting bigger as tax revenues dry up. 'The 90,000 people who marched through the streets of London on Saturday calling for a pay rise understand that it's not just British workers who need wages to go up, but that's what the Treasury and the economy needs too. 'Only a wages-led recovery can bring about the boost in demand that businesses need and the boost in revenue that the Government needs to cut the deficit and invest for the future.'"}]}

Armed robber Charles Bronson, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson attacked a dozen staff at Full Sutton prison in York . Charles Bronson is to sell off pieces of his artwork to raise money to send his mother on holiday as an apology for attacking 12 prison guards after the FA Cup final, it emerged yesterday. The career criminal, who is a fanatical Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged after north London rivals Arsenal beat Hull in the FA Cup. The armed robber was especially annoyed as Hull went two goals ahead before being defeated in extra time. In response, Bronson smeared himself in Lurpack butter and attacked a dozen prison officers. Bronson's mother Eira, 85, is said to have been upset by her son's latest rampage in Full Sutton prison in York on May 17 after Arsenal's latest FA Cup success. Now, Bronson, 61, has instructed Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Katie to include several of his own artworks in a sale of gangster memorabilia being auctioned on June 17. The paintings are being sold by JP Humbert auctioneers in Towcester, Northants and are expected to reach at least \u00a35,000. Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert describes the works as 'a peak into the mind of an intelligent man with some issues'. Bronson uses art to explain some of his darkest fantasies and his mental struggles. One picture shows eight books stacked on top of each other each with parts of Bronson\u2019s life named on the spine, with various terrifying faces around it inside a cell. Each painting will have a minimum estimate of between \u00a3400-\u00a3600. There are a total of ten Charles Bonson related items included in the sale.

Bronson has written to Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Kate to sell ten items of memorabilia including several of his artworks, including this one titled 'A day in the life of life' which has an auction estimate of \u00a3400-\u00a3600 . According to Mr Humbert: 'Charles Bronson recently had a \u2018rumble\u2019 with twelve prison guards. 'In a letter to Kate Kray, he states remorse at upsetting his mother and accordingly, asked if some of his artwork could be included in the sale so as to generate funds to send his mother on holiday. 'The intimate and personal nature of these never-before seen Kray items and Bronson paintings show a real human side to these larger than life personalities. 'Although they are bound to polarise opinions, the lots, much like the individuals, are far from dull. 'It\u2019s almost impossible to say how much they will go for, the market will dictate that, but with his art selling for up to \u00a31,000 a piece in the past there will be a lot of interest. 'We have already had a lot of people phoning up to ask about the pictures. 'They are a peak into the mind of an intelligent man who, well lets say, has had a lot of issues. 'I would put an initial estimate of \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 but that is a starting estimate. 'There is no reserve on it, and I fully expect us to see a lot of interest in two weeks when it goes on sale. This is a very important and eclectic sale of British social history.' Bronson wants to use the funds generated from the sale to send his mother Eira Peterson on holiday as an apology for his most recent prison rampage . In one of the artworks for sale in the auction, Bronson, 61, calls for Kate Kray to be appointed prime minister and claims to have been 'born insane' He is also selling a handwritten poem entitled Asylum about Ronnie Kray . Bronson, asked Kate Kray, pictured, to include his paintings in a sale of her husband's memorabilia later this month . Bronson was jailed for seven years following a raid on a post office in 1974.\u00a0 In the past 40 years, he has only been a free man for just four months and nine days. He has spent a total of 36 years in solitary confinement due to his violent outbursts. Much of his artwork relates to violent scenes involving prison offers and have featured in exhibitions around the globe. He has taken hostages in ten different sieges as well as injuring 30 prison officers. He has caused at least \u00a3500,000 worth of damages in rooftop protests. In 1999, he was sentenced to life for taking education worker Phil Danielson hostage for 44 hours for criticism of his art.

Miss Olson, who has been a reporter at the station since January 2013, was covering the The Register\u2019s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. But she was repeatedly stopped by people wanting to make sure they got their faces on camera too. Not only did she have to deal with people sneaking up behind her, she also had people shouting and whooping in the background while she gives her piece to camera . The first clip shows a cyclist unzip his top and flash his chest in the background in a bid to disrupt her report. Another cyclist then attempts to get close to her so he can stick his hand in her face, to which she shouts: 'Did you photobomb me?' She then has to deal with people whooping and cheering as while she tries to talk. In another clip as she speaks to the camera, a man in a passing car can be heard shouting: 'Travis it's that girl from the TV station!' While in the fourth clip as she speaks to the camera, a man in a passing car can be heard shouting: 'Travis it's that girl from the TV station!' She posted the compilation to her Instagram page saying: 'My entire week has been like this. At least Travis is a fan? #RAGBRAI #photobomb #MMJ #reporterprobs'"}]}

This weekend, The Sunday Times published excerpts from Fielding's upcoming book, \"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,\" that reveal a crucial character, Mr. Darcy, has been killed off. Cue the collective gasps of horror from around the world. Fielding first introduced heroine Bridget Jones in 1996 with her best-selling \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" a cheeky look at a 30-something single woman's adventures with life and love in London. During that initial installment, Bridget gets to know the prickly but sweet Mark Darcy, and in the follow-up, 1999's \"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,\" he proposes. But by the time we get to \"Mad About the Boy,\" Darcy is dead and Bridget is a 51-year-old widowed mother of two. (At least they got to have kids before he kicked the bucket -- the reason behind which is still unknown.) Fielding said when the new novel was announced that Bridget would be in a different place with \"Mad About the Boy.\" \"My life has moved on and Bridget's will move on, too,\" the author said in February. \"I hope people will have as much fun reading it, as I am writing it.\" That's questionable, considering some of the intense reactions fans have had to the news of Darcy's death. \"Just found out Mark Darcy, from the #BridgetJones sequel, was killed off !!!! I can't handle this!\" said one fan. \"Helen Fielding killed off Mark Darcy in the new Bridget Jones book? My hopeless romantic heart is devastated,\" said another. Given that these reactions have poured in on Twitter, the conversation does occasionally turn hyperbolic: \"The news said that Mark darcy gets killed off in the 3rd Bridget Jones, my life has ended,\" tweeted one distraught fan. Posted another: \"If Mark Darcy is really dead I have no reason to live anymore. #overlydramatic #bridgetjones #whywouldshedothis\" Yet another clung to some \"Dexter\"-inspired hope: \"Could it be that Mark Darcy fakes his own death & ends up as a lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest?\" the user queried. Either way, it is apparent that Bridget has moved on. In the Sunday Times excerpt, she describes her indecision between attending pal Talitha's 60th birthday party, and spending time with her \"toy boy,\" a nearly-30-year-old named Roxster. Both \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and \"The Edge of Reason\" were adapted into movies starring Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, and a third movie is expected to be on the way. At this point, we're not sure if Firth should be quite so excited."}]}

The revelation that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant came after she was admitted to hospital in London on Monday afternoon suffering acute morning sickness. The newspaper said the royal couple had hoped to keep their baby news under wraps until Christmas Day, when she had passed the 12-week mark in her pregnancy. \"Kate expectations,\" declared popular British tabloid, The Sun, with an article detailing the treatment that Catherine, 30, was receiving for hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that causes more severe nausea and vomiting than typical morning sickness. The newspaper said even senior royals, including Queen Elizabeth II, were taken by surprise as the couple had yet to break the news to family. The Sun's graphics department produced composite images of what they speculated the royal baby would look like as a baby of either gender, while the Mail ran mock-ups created by a U.S. forensic artist imagining how the child might look as a young boy or girl. The Times also led with news of Catherine's hospital dash, splashing a picture across its front page of a concerned William leaving London's King Edward VII hospital last night. The paper also joined the rush of feverish debate about the future royal's sex, potential name and position in the royal line of succession. Boy or girl, the new baby will be third in line to the throne, behind William and his father, Prince Charles, who will become a grandfather for the first time. The Times explained that an imminent change to the law means that if Catherine has a girl, the child will make history by being the first British princess not to suffer discrimination because of her sex. UK tabloid the Daily Express, in a \"royal souvenir special\" edition, ran a piece speculating that it was more likely that Catherine was carrying a girl, or twins, citing research that linked those outcomes to morning sickness. Bookmakers also look set for a royal bonanza, with Victoria, Frances and Mary among the frontrunners for the most likely girl's name, though the odds that William's first-born child will be named after his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, have been judged at between 9-1 and 12-1, The Times said. However, Elizabeth is the hot favorite at 8-1, according to leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes. Brooklyn and Chardonnay were listed as long shots by bookmakers. Ladbrokes has Charles and John at 10-1 when it comes to boy's names, but Harry, the name of the baby's uncle, is a distinct outsider at 33-1. Bookmakers are also taking bets on the baby's hair color, with one offering brown at 6-4 and red at 8-1, and another offering odds on the likelihood of an albino royal baby. Bookmakers were also taking bets on the child's birth weight, and the identity of the godparents. As expected, the name game is a white-hot pastime on social media, with #royalbabynames and #royalbaby among the biggest trending hashtags on Twitter. Among the more amusing suggestions were Cheryl and Jedward, reflecting Britain's recent obsession with television talent shows. Twitter was also a popular destination for celebrities and public figures alike to voice their happiness at the news. British Prime Minister David Cameron was swift to offer his congratulations. Businessman Richard Branson joined the well wishers. Former Wimbledon tennis champ Boris Becker tweeted a picture of himself giving two thumbs up with a message of congratulations. The news prompted responses from U.S. celebrities as well, with reality TV star Kim Kardashian tweeting her delight at the reports. News of the royal baby also grabbed column inches internationally. \"Royal baby a bonus for special editions,\" declared The Australian, as it predicted that Australian women's magazines would now go into coverage hyperdrive with a series of royal specials. \"Royal Baby a 'Delight,' Especially to Britain's Tabloids,\" ran the headline in The New York Times. The paper's Sarah Lyall observed that \"speculation began virtually the moment Kate Middleton said 'I will' to Prince William in April 2011, leaving an industry of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines with a big black hole where their wedding coverage used to be.\" Lyall said those who had previously -- and incorrectly -- guessed something was afoot because Catherine was drinking water instead of wine at some official dinner could now finally claim to be right."}]}

Lifeguards along more than six miles of pristine sand in this Southern California beach city had rescued more than 200 people by the time the call came to help a distressed swimmer east of one of the main piers. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves. The 32-year-old, a passionate surfer and one of the fastest swimmers on the 200-strong mostly seasonal lifeguard staff, was pronounced dead late on Sunday after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves . Ben Carlson was described as a 'swimming monster' who knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing . He was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide. \u2018He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,\u2019 said his father, Chris Carlson. \u2018He was a water monster - that was one of the things that was so unbelievable to us; a lowly 10-foot wave would take him out because he was so experienced.\u2019 He said his son knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing. Newport Beach lifeguard boats converge at the end of the pier after the three hour search for a missing lifeguard Ben Carlson ended . 'He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,' said his father, Chris Carlson . \u2018It's one of those professions that people think you're getting in the way of fun, or it's kind of a cakewalk job, and something like this happens, and people realize how truly dangerous it can be,\u2019 Carlson said. The swimmer, who has not been identified by authorities, was brought to shore and survived. Conditions on Sunday were especially treacherous, with swells of 12 feet or more crashing in without warning and a strong current that took swimmers by surprise. Around 100,000 people packed the beach with about 80 lifeguards on duty, said Rob Williams, the city's chief lifeguard. \u2018It's not typical that we always have 10- to 12-foot surf, but it does happen once or twice a year, and it happened to be a Sunday with fantastic weather on a holiday weekend,\u2019 said Williams, whose guards made more than 200 rescues and issued 3,000 warnings to beachgoers that day. Carlson was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide . Newport Beach lifeguards rescued hundreds of swimmers over the weekend due to dangerous rip currents . The city gets 10 million beach visitors annually. The National Weather Service had warned Sunday of dangerous rip currents and high surf along Southern California beaches due to a swell originating in the Southern Hemisphere. Beachgoers said on Monday that a particularly huge swell surged ashore in the late afternoon, drenching blankets and upsetting picnics. Shortly after, rescue boats buzzed between the waves and helicopters began flying low over the water up and down the beach. \u2018The waves were huge. I saw it and I thought a tsunami was coming,\u2019 said Shirley Reinker, 72, who has lived along the beach for 40 years. The fallen lifeguard was raised in the inland suburbs of Southern California but always loved the ocean. As soon as Ben Carlson was old enough to get a driver's license, he tried to get a lifeguard job about an hour's drive away in Newport Beach, his father said. Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach . He traveled to surf big waves and played water polo at the University of California, Irvine. And while worked as beverages director for the Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant chain, he would lifeguard whenever he could, the elder Carlson said. He was one of the fastest swimmers on staff, Williams said. All lifeguards must be able to swim 0.6 miles in under 20 minutes and re-qualify annually, but Carlson had additional training to work on a boat as a rescue swimmer and drive patrol vehicles, Williams said. As a seasonal guard, Carlson made about $22 an hour. Friends hung his red lifeguard jacket over the bar at a local Irish pub blocks from the beach, a lifeguard hangout. A sign outside read: \u2018Ben would go. We love you. You will be missed.\u2019 An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday. For his part, the elder Carlson takes some solace in that his son died doing what he loved most, and that he was a man of faith. \u2018He's in paradise today - swimming with dolphins,\u2019 he said."}]}

Nearly 80 families were forced to flee to a nearby UN refugee shelter as areas on the Gaza Strip were swamped under the muddy water. Children and elderly people had to help clear some of the water from the roads using small buckets, while horses and carriages were also being used to get personal belongings and family members through the murky brown sludge. Hundreds of Palestinians, including this father with his two children, have been left homeless or struggling to cope after flooding in al-Mughraqa in Gaza . Children, including this young boy in bare feet, and elderly people have had to help clear some of the water from the roads and pavements using small buckets . The floods led to false accusations that Israel had opened up dams along the river to intentionally cause the flooding, even though no dams exist in southern Israel. A spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT) told VICE News: 'These claims, I don't know who started them, but they are completely false. 'There are no dams in the southern part of Israel so we couldn't open any dams because there aren't any. I don't know how these rumours got around.' In an unrelated incident, an Israeli power company cut electricity in Nablus and Jenin, which are on the West Bank rather than Gaza, on the same day, for a short period of time. The state-owned company said that they made the decision to cut power because the Palestinian government owes them $492 million. The Israel Electric Corporation said it had long warned about the debt. A statement released by the company said: 'We limited for 45 minutes today the supply of electricity to five power lines in Nablus and Jenin.' Palestinians claimed that Israeli authorities opened dams along the river, causing water to rush down into a number of villages - but Israel said there are no dams to open . One boy, pictured, helps an elderly women get across the water with two donkeys . Some of the evacuated families have been set up in nearby shelters for Palestinian refugees, which are sponsored by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). They will be provided with food and drink, but do not know when they can return home. In 2010 and December 2013 flooding  forced 100 families from their homes. At the time local defence services said they saved seven people who had been at risk of drowning. One gentleman stands outside what used to be a house . One boy braves the water, finding an old sign to clutch on to as he makes his way through the town . It is thought that the water is three feet deep in places. It has caused chaos on the roads, including this gentleman whose white car got stuck . The UN also had to declare a state of 'emergency' in Gaza City last November after two days of heavy rain caused flooding in the war-ravaged area. Some 100,000 Palestinians also remain homeless across Gaza after a bloody 50-day war between Israeli and Hamas militants destroyed homes, roads and services. UNRWA said in January that it cannot afford to repair the homes damaged last year because donors have failed to pay. It said in a statement: 'The agency has exhausted all funding to support repairs and rental subsidies. '$5.4 billion (\u00a33.5bn) was pledged at the Cairo aid conference last October and virtually none of it has reached Gaza. This is distressing and unacceptable.' Camels, donkeys and horses are being used by locals to move belongings and people through the water-logged area . One boy braves getting into a sunken container in the middle of the water.

The United States and its European allies say Sunday's referendum vote violated Ukraine's newly reforged constitution and amounts to a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to expand its borders to the Black Sea peninsula under a threat of force. Moscow asserts Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in an illegal coup, which ended Ukraine's constitutional authority. Russian President Vladimir Putin argues Crimeans should have the right to decide how they want to be governed going forward. So who's right? \"The answer depends on what your perspective is,\" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. \"The U.S. is buying into the argument of the Ukraine government, which is that the secession of Crimea from Ukraine is not constitutional under the terms of the Ukrainian constitution,\" Rothkopf said. \"The alternative argument is that all peoples have a right of self-determination and that if the people of Crimea choose not to be part of Ukraine, that is their prerogative in the same way that it was the choice of colonial powers to break away from the imperial powers that claimed them or parts of the former Yugoslavia were free to head off on their own,\" he added. Ukraine 'will never accept' Crimea annexation, President says . The standoff between the United States and Russia resembles tension from the Cold War era. \"We'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,\" President Barack Obama said on Monday. \"The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity; and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,\" Obama said. The United States and Europe imposed travel bans and froze assets of senior Russian and Crimean officials. The Obama administration went a step further by banning entry and freezing all U.S. assets held by any Russian government official or people with close financial ties to 11 people, including advisers to Putin. Legal or not, Crimean referendum will shape Ukraine crisis . Separate from the vote, Crimean lawmakers approved a resolution on Monday that declared the Black Sea peninsula an independent, sovereign state and requested to join the Russian Federation. Putin later in the day signed a decree that recognized Crimea's independence, the Kremlin said. He will address a joint session of Parliament on Crimea on Tuesday. Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently by phone and stressed the Crimean referendum was in accordance with international law, including Article 1 of the U.N. Charter regarding the principle of self-determination. \"It was emphasized that Russia will respect the choice of the Crimean people,\" according to a Kremlin statement summarizing that conversation. Obama told Putin during a phone call on Sunday that \"Russia's actions were in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" according to the White House. Putin pushed back, according to a statement from the Kremlin, and said the situation in Crimea is akin to Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia in 2008. \"Regarding the March 16 referendum in Crimea, Mr Putin said that the decision to hold the referendum was in line with international law and the U.N. Charter, and was also in line with the precedent set by Kosovo,\" the Kremlin said. \"The referendum was organized in such a way as to guarantee Crimea's population the possibility to freely express their will and exercise their right to self-determination,\" it said. West hits back at Russians over Crimea . Even within Crimea's pro-Russia majority, opinions about the legality of seceding are split. Voters proudly proclaimed their support for rejoining Russia as they stood in line in dreary weather to vote. However, one, who was too afraid to speak to CNN on camera, proclaimed the referendum illegal. The ethnic Tatars and younger voters have also questioned the legality of secession. Many of the Tatar minority boycotted the referendum with some leaders calling it \"a farce\" forced by armed men. As the United States and Russia attempt to hash out their differences, pressure mounts for Putin to move quickly and carefully in resolving the Crimean crisis, Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute told CNN International. \"He basically has two choices. Choice Number One would be to move fairly quickly to annex Crimea and that is going to then seem as a very naked land grab and will make it very difficult then for a dialogue to move forward,\" Pifer said. \"That move will likely mean Western nations will ratchet up the level of sanctions, Pifer said. \"The alternative is they take the vote but that the Russians don't move very quickly,\" Pifer said. \"They let Crimea basically stay in some limbo status which will create some opportunity perhaps for negotiation that can diffuse this crisis.\" CNN's Tom Cohen and Marie-Louise Gumuchian, and CNN Money's Mark Thompson contributed to this report."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: It has become a tragically familiar scene in American life: law enforcement officers descending on a packed school where a gunman is on the loose. A procession of students, their hands raised, slowly making their way out of the danger zone. But the handling of Friday's shooting at Arapahoe High School -- just 10 miles from the scene of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before fatally shooting themselves -- drew important lessons from the earlier bloodshed. At Arapahoe High School, where senior Claire Davis, 17, was critically injured before the shooter turned the gun on himself, law enforcement officers responded within minutes and immediately entered the school to confront the gunman rather than surrounding the building, authorities said. As the sound of shots reverberated through the corridors, teachers immediately followed procedures put in place after Columbine, locking the doors and moving students to the rear of classrooms. \"That's straight out of Columbine,\" Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based consulting firm, told CNN Saturday. \"The goal is to proceed and neutralize the shooter. Columbine really revolutionized the way law enforcement responds to active shooters.\" Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson credited the quick police response time for the fact that student Karl Pierson, the gunman, stopped firing on others and turned his weapon on himself. In fact, Robinson told reporters Saturday, Pierson killed himself less than 1 minute, 20 seconds after entering the school. Robinson said a deputy sheriff assigned as a school resource officer and an unarmed security guard immediately closed in on the shooter. \"That one minute and 20 seconds, in my mind, is extraordinarily relevant,\" he said, noting that Pierson was heavily armed, with ammunition, a knife and three explosives. Authorities knew from research and contact with forensic psychologists that school shooters typically continue firing until confronted by law enforcement, Robinson said. \"We believe that the response from the school resource officer and from the unarmed school security officer was absolutely critical to the fact we did not have additional injury and or death,\" he said. Robinson said the so-called active shooter response protocol, which was developed after Columbine, was put into place. In addition, school staff and students implemented a well-rehearsed lockdown practice. \"The combination of quick response by the resource officer and the implementation of a lockdown protocol caused the children and staff to be safe,\" he said. \"Both protocols came together as they were designed to do.\" Friday's shooting came on the eve of the one year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished elementary school in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Newtown marks anniversary of school killings . \"It's very unfortunate that we have to say that there's a textbook response on the way to respond to these, because that textbook was written based on all of the incidents that we've had and the lessons learned,\" Trump said. Trump said both Sandy Hook and the latest shooting in Colorado highlight the importance of \"training and engaging\" school support staff -- from custodians to school secretaries to maintenance and food service workers -- on how to best respond during these incidents. In Sandy Hook, a school custodian's 911 calls provided authorities some of the first information about what was happening. \"Often these people are not getting training in school emergency planning,\" Trump said. \"In a critical incident, they may be the first person to respond.\" At Arapahoe High School, a school janitor spotted Pierson, whose intended target was a faculty member, in his tactical gear, he told CNN affiliate KMGH. \"It just looked weird,\" Fabian Llerenas said. \"He went in, and I heard two pops. That's when I knew. I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'\" Llerenas said he called 911 and then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school. Pierson had fired at the man but missed, Llerenas told KUSA. \"He was so [shaken] up, he felt the wind hit, out of the shotgun just blew his hair, but it didn't hit him. It was that scary for him,\" Llerenas said. \"In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made,\" Robinson said. The faculty member \"left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school.\" Trump said other lessons learned from Columbine included the controlled evacuations and pat-down searches of students in a secure area. Self evacuations can create chaos for the police. Additionally, schools now have predesignated parent-student \"reunification centers\" to prevent parents from showing up at the scene and interfering with law enforcement, as was the case in Sandy Hook, Trump said. \"The lessons of Columbine are still the best practices,\" Trump said. After Sandy Hook. Trump said, some officials advocated a \"run, hide or fight\" approach developed for workplace shootings in which teachers and students are encouraged to be prepared to throw things at gunmen. Some even suggested that elementary school students use items such as cans of soup to attack gunmen. Trump called it a \"high risk, high liability proposition.\" \"The good news is that we're getting better at preventing and responding to these incidents,\" he said. \"The bad news is that there will be cases that slip through the cracks.\""}]}

The 86-year-old monarch was admitted to a London hospital on March 3 with symptoms of gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, before being released the following day. A palace source told CNN the queen's health problems are \"nothing serious\" and \"nothing to fret about,\" despite preventing her attending the Commonwealth Observance service at London's Westminster Abbey. The queen will still attend Monday evening's Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House, the statement said, where she will sign a new charter calling for equal rights in all Commonwealth nations. The charter, adopted in December by all 54 countries over which the queen nominally presides, declares: \"We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.\" While some observers believe the queen's signing of the Commonwealth Charter signals her implicit support for gay rights and women's equality, a Buckingham Palace official said the monarch is merely carrying out her official duties. The official said: \"The Queen is apolitical and is signing the document in her capacity as head of the Commonwealth.\" The 16-point charter also embraces democracy, freedom of speech and the rule of law among its provisions. The charter's principles could be difficult to implement in many Commonwealth countries, like Nigeria and Uganda, where homosexual acts are currently illegal. Prince Philip, the queen's husband, will attend the ceremony at Westminister Abbey, where a recorded message from the queen will be played. This year's Commonwealth theme is \"Opportunity through enterprise,\" and in the message the queen declares: \"From climbing the highest mountain, to winning a sporting competition, making a scientific breakthrough, building a successful business or discovering unique artistic talent -- these outcomes all begin as a simple goal or idea in one person's mind.\" \"Our shared values of peace, democracy, development, justice and human rights -- which are found in our new 'Commonwealth Charter' -- mean that we place special emphasis on including everyone in this goal, especially those who are vulnerable.\" A Palace official said the queen, who celebrated her 60th year on the throne in 2012, hopes to undertake some of her official engagements planned for the rest of this week."}]}

'She's safe!': Home invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday. The teen was returned to her family safe and sound Wednesday . A vigil of 150 people gathered late Tuesday evening, but Perez\u2019s aunt Suky Guerrero told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she was still unsure where the money was going to come from. \u2018My brother doesn\u2019t have a clue. He doesn\u2019t have any money like that,\u2019 Geurrero, the sister of the girl\u2019s father, told the Journal-Constitution. A law enforcement source confirmed the ransom demand to the Atlanta paper. Meanwhile, local officials have publicly denied knowledge of a ransom. 'We haven't heard anything about a ransom, I don't know how that got out,' Clayton County police Sergeant Kevin Hughes told Mailonline. Sergeant Hughes said the county is now working in conjunction with state and federal officials. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesperson said the FBI has now taken the lead on the case. A call to FBI's Atlanta division was not immediately returned Wednesday morning. Terrified: The 4-foot-9, Hispanic teen was wrenched from her terrifying mother around 2am Tuesday while she was still wearing her Star Wars pajamas.

UNHCR goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie visits the Al Waleed refugee camp in August. About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of \"vulnerable and sick\" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week, the UNHCR reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. \"UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval,\" the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. \"UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Sudan and Chile,\" the agency said.

Year after year, Joel Blanc makes the short pilgrimage from his Paris studio to the Stade Roland Garros for the tennis year's second grand slam, aiming to encapsulate the tournament's magic onto his canvas. In a style reminiscent of those Impressionist forefathers, he brings to life in his paintings what he witnesses taking place in front of him on the famous red clay courts. \"When I begin the painting, I don't know exactly what will happen but I know what I want to introduce in the beginning. After, it's a story of life,\" he told CNN's Open Court show. \"I know how it begins, but I don't know how it finishes.\" A key principle of Impressionism was to paint outdoors rather than inside a studio, so it's a style tailor-made to Blanc's own way of working. It's an approach that has won over tennis stars such as Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal -- both fans and owners of the Frenchman's paintings -- or television companies, who invite him to cover sporting events. Making his first visit to depict the action on the main court of Philippe Chatrier in 2004, Blanc has returned every year since, attracted by both the stadium and the French Open's allure and charm. \"Roland Garros is my favorite place,\" says the 68-year-old. \"It's very special, it's near to my studio, I'm like a neighbor. \"It's like a fascination in Paris, the time of Roland Garros in Paris is very special so there is a real attraction,\" he says. \"I am very proud to be there.\" The painter had to wait some time, however, before that short pilgrimage from his studio could become a reality. In the same way that the original artists of the Impressionism movement, established in Paris in the 1870s, initially drew criticism for their apparent trivial approach to art, Blanc had his own detractors -- his parents. They wanted him to forge a career as a surgeon or dentist rather than become an artist -- something that ultimately put him in good stead years down the line. \"I have to thank them for that as they obliged me not to be an artist just like that, they obliged me to learn anatomy at school,\" says Blanc, who was born in Toulon in the south of France. \"But all those years of learning actually gave me the great freedom for painting -- from horses to the body, from landscape to anything I have to draw. I know the proportions, I know everything. I'm able to do it.\" From the late 1880s the public's perception became more favorable towards the Impressionism movement, much like the trajectory of Blanc's career. Following an education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Blanc first developed his passion for capturing the moment in equestrian events -- making a living out of depicting horses and their riders. And in keeping with the tradition of Impressionism, he also often found himself recreating scenes from the French countryside. It was not until far further down the line, though, at the age of 57, that Blanc got his real break as an artist when he was invited to cover the World Athletics Championships in Paris in 2003 by French television station France 2. \"I knew this was what I wanted to do. I was supported by the runners as I put all my body into my work, so I was like one of them,\" he recalls. \"This woman asked me to finish a painting and give it to a 100-meter runner at the end, so I finished it in 10 seconds and gave it to him!\" That success prompted another invitation from France 2 to cover the following year's French Open. \"In my work, I need to have a challenge and draw something that other people can't do, so I turned to sport,\" he says. \"What I feel when I do this type of painting is a communion with what I draw. \"I have to be not inside (the athlete) but it's something like communion -- my eyes and my hand. I don't take care of my hand, it's only a problem of mind.\" Blanc, who has covered other sports such as golf and rugby, thrives on the unpredictability of capturing these instant action moments. \"Every sport has its own specialty. For example, polo ... it's like a fight, it's very quick and the movement of horses change in a second,\" he says. \"So if you don't decide what you want to represent, it's like rugby, it changes very quickly. If you don't decide quickly, you are lost. You have to clear your mind in every sport.\" When Blanc first put his easel on the side of a tennis court, he was unaware of the endless possibilities that were about to unfold both on court and in his mind. \"The first time I thought, like for golf, that tennis was always the same,\" he says. \"I have been painting Nadal and Federer for years and years when they were always in the final, in Monte Carlo and at Roland Garros, and I could say it's always the same story. \"But it's not, because there is an adaption from one to the other and the strategy of each one is very specific, and the movements then change. And the movement has to be taken in the very instant.\" Sport is by nature cyclical, adds Blanc, but the same events every year bring fresh inspiration. \"If something new doesn't happen then the people will be bored by that, but every time we all witness something new without fail.\""}]}

Sainsbury's is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK\u00bfs second biggest supermarket . They've wooed us with buy one get one free offers, value ranges and loyalty card reward points. Now supermarkets are tapping into the growing trend among families for using coupons at the tills to get us through the doors \u2013 and beat rival chains in the supermarket wars. Sainsbury\u2019s is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket. The aggressive voucher strategy has helped the group to increase its sales faster than its biggest rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. Yesterday Sainsbury\u2019s reported an impressive annual sales increase of 4.6 per cent to \u00a325.6billion, while underlying profits to the end of March were up 6.2 per cent to \u00a3756million. Research by the supermarket found 93 per cent of us use coupons to save money on grocery shopping, while 30 per cent have increased our coupon usage in the last year. It also discovered families living in the well-heeled counties of Sussex, Kent and Warwickshire are most likely to redeem vouchers, showing\u00a0 how popular the couponing trend has become among middle-income families living through the biggest squeeze on living standards since the Second World War. Under its Brand Match coupon scheme, Sainsbury\u2019s has issued 350million vouchers since 2011 to customers spending over \u00a320, regardless of whether they have a Nectar loyalty card. The scheme works by calculating whether a customer has bought any big brand products, such as Kellogg\u2019s or Heinz, which are cheaper at rivals Tesco or Asda. If the customer could have saved money by going elsewhere then the till prints out a paper coupon worth the difference. Sainsbury\u2019s is now issuing around 20million of the coupons a month. Yesterday Sainsbury's reported an impressive annual sales increase of 4.6 per cent to \u00a325.6billion . The aggressive voucher strategy has helped the group to increase its sales faster than its biggest rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons . The Brand Match scheme has been such a success that Tesco launched its own version with added benefits in March. Its Price Promise promotion reimburses customers at the till if their shopping would have been cheaper at Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda or Morrisons. Crucially, it goes further than Sainsbury\u2019s to include a comparison of own-brand products.The level of competition shows how much is at stake for the supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s was overtaken by Asda at the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket in 2008. However, it has achieved an annual growth in sales for 33 quarters in a row and is closing in on its nearest rival with market share of 16.8 per cent versus 17.5 per cent for Asda. The Sainsbury\u2019s results were boosted by non-food sales, such as its Tu fashion range, electrical goods and furniture, which reached \u00a31billion for the first time. Grocery sales online were close to \u00a31billion, while Sainsbury\u2019s Local convenience stores took \u00a31.5billion. The Brand Match scheme has been such a success that Tesco launched its own version with added benefits in March . Chief executive Justin King said: \u2018Whilst we see no near-term change in the current economic situation, we remain confident that by continuing to invest in our long-standing strategy and by understanding and helping our customers, we are well positioned for future growth.\u2019 On Saturday, the Daily Mail highlighted the case of 16-year-old Jordon Cox who has taken collecting coupons to extraordinary lengths. He bought \u00a3105.88 of goods, such as big brand breakfast cereals, cheese and drinks, but handed over just \u00a31.62 at the till thanks to his coupon collection. Meanwhile research from the Institute of Grocery Distribution suggests many household are changing the family diet based on vouchers. Some 62 per cent of wealthier families changed the food they bought to take advantage of vouchers and promotions."}]}

Theoneste Bagosora, right, and his co-defendant Anatole Nsengiyumva, left, arrive in court. It is the first time the tribunal has convicted high-level officials for the 100-day genocide in 1994 which left an estimated 800,000 people dead. Theoneste Bagosora, 67, a colonel in the Rwandan army, was found guilty along with two other men -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. All were sentenced to life in prison. The tribunal -- located in Arusha, Tanzania -- acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, and ordered his immediate release. CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour -- who covered the story -- called the verdicts \"a real turning point and a milestone in justice.\"  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on the verdict \u00bb . \"It sends a message that right up the chain of command, you cannot hide,\" Amanpour said. The court said Bagosora was a key figure in drawing up plans for the genocide. A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis. The massacres began after a plane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. The court said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired from the airport in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.  Watch what happened in the court \u00bb . Bagosora decided the military should take over and he refused to involve the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, in any discussions, the court found. April 7, while Bagosora held a crisis meeting with top military officials, the prime minister was arrested, sexually assaulted and killed by top members of the Rwandan Army, the court found.  Find out more about the world's killing fields \u00bb . That made Bagosora the head of all political and military affairs in Rwanda, and in that capacity, he was at the top of the chain of command. The same day the prime minister was killed, the court said, army personnel confined and killed four important opposition leaders -- including the president of the constitutional court and government ministers -- and murdered 10 Belgian peacekeepers who had been dispatched to the prime minister's residence. The court found Bagosora bore responsibility for those and other killings because he commanded those who carried out the crimes. \"Bagosora was the highest authority in the Ministry of Defense and exercised effective control of the Rwandan army and gendarmerie,\" said Presiding Judge Erik Mose. \"He's therefore responsible for the murder of the prime minister, the four opposition politicians, the 10 Belgian peacekeepers, as well as the extensive military involvement in the killing of civilians during this period.\" ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow said the convicted men \"prepared, planned, ordered, directed, incited, encouraged and approved the murder of innocent civilian Tutsis.\" The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said. The court found that from April to July 1994, Bagosora exercised authority over members of the Rwandan Army and their militiamen, who committed massacres throughout Rwanda with Bagosora's knowledge. \"In all the regions of the country, members of the Tutsi population who were fleeing from the massacres on their hills sought refuge in locations they thought would be safe, often on the recommendation of the local civil and military authorities,\" the indictment said. \"In many of these places, despite the promise that they would be protected by the local civil and military authorities, the refugees were attacked, abducted and massacred, often on the orders or with the complicity of those same authorities.\" The indictment against Bagosora alleged he had been opposed to concessions made by his government to Tutsi rebels at 1993 peace talks in Tanzania, and had left the negotiations saying he was returning to Rwanda to \"prepare the apocalypse.\" The U.N. established the tribunal in late 1994. The trial began in April 2002 and has been deliberating since June 1, 2007. During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense. The three convicted men will be held in the tribunal's custody until a state can be found to house them. The genocide's impact is still be felt today, with recent fighting in neighbouring Congo blamed on lingering tensions from the slaughter. Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo."}]}

The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. It comes days before Obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers, the Summit of the Americas, in Trinidad and Tobago. \"President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future,\" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama also ordered new steps to promote the \"freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people,\" Gibbs added. The president took \"these steps [in part] to help bridge the gap among divided Cuban families.\" Obama believes that the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant, democratic Cuban government, noted White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo. He thinks \"that creating independence, creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba,\" Restrepo said. Several key components of America's embargo on the island nation will be preserved, however. Among other things, Americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high-ranking Cuban government officials and Communist Party members. Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place. Critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long-settled U.S. policy. President Ra\u00fal Castro's \"dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world. The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy,\" Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, said in a written statement. Obama \"should not make any unilateral change in America's policy toward Cuba. Instead, Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented.\" Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Florida, and a native of Cuba, had kinder words for the administration, saying, \"The announcement today is good news for Cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in Cuba.\" He said that, in turn, the Cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the United States. \"Lowering remittance charges and allowing travel for Cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the Cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in Havana,\" he said. Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, held a news conference last week urging Obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all \"prisoners of conscience,\" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds \"free and fair\" elections. \"Over the past 50 years, the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent, courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes,\" Smith said. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy.  Watch report on easing of travel restrictions \u00bb . \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard, our current policy toward Cuba just hasn't worked. Simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba,\" she said in a written statement. Lee and other Congressional Black Caucus members met in Havana this month with Ra\u00fal Castro and his brother, former President Fidel Castro. Several members of Congress see broader relations with Cuba as vital to U.S. interests. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. \"I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,\" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sarah Stephens, director of the Cuba Travel Projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo, said Monday that \"these are welcome steps, but the right course is to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba, to open up commerce and to directly engage the Cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries' interests.\"  Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists \u00bb . Obama \"has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the Cold War but the first president to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations,\" she argued. Before he was elected president, Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. Provisions attached to a $410 billion supplemental budget Obama signed in March also made it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. In addition, they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The provisions loosened restrictions enacted by President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Obama's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot-button political issue. Seventy-one percent of Americans think the United States should re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, according an April 3-5 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, and 64 percent think the United States should lift the travel ban to Cuba for all Americans. Sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points."}]}

On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found Contador guilty of taking banned substance clenbuterol, although they also ruled that the Spaniard did not ingest it intentionally and was likely a victim of a contaminated food supplement. But the 29-year-old, who addressed a packed press conference at a hotel in his home town of Pinto, just south of Madrid, said he was disgusted with the outcome and protested his innocence. \"I am going to continue cycling,\" said Contador. \"I am going to continue practicing it cleanly, the way I have my entire life. \"My mood right now is not the best but I know this will make me stronger in the future,\" added Contador, who blamed contaminated steak for his positive test. He continued: \"Anyone who reads the decision will clearly see that I did not take drugs. The hardest thing has been to see the suffering my family has been through.\" Contador's positive test related to the 2010 Tour de France, which he won by just 39 seconds ahead of Luxembourg's Andy Schleck. It was made public by Contador himself in August 2010, with the two-year ban backdated to that announcement, meaning he can resume racing in seven months. However, Contador has been stripped of all his victories from that period, with Schleck now awarded the 2010 Tour de France title and Italian Michele Scarponi named the winner of the 2011 Giro d'Italia. He will miss this year's Giro, Tour and Olympic Games. However, he will be eligible for the 2012 Tour of Spain, a race he won in 2008, and for the world championships in Limburg, Netherlands.

The victim died in January in the northern city of Santander, according to the statement, which did not provide further details. The victim was a woman who was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain. \"The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than nine years ago,\" the ministry statement said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease also called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. Three of Spain's five deaths from the disease were in the northern province of Leon. The city of Santander is in the nearby Cantabria province. Last September, officials reported the death of a woman from the human form of mad cow disease. Officials also said her son had died earlier from the same disease. It was believed to have been the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from the disease, Badiola told CNN at the time. The mother, in her early 60s, died in August 2008. Her son, 41, died in February 2008, Badiola said. Badiola said it was the mother and son likely contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in Spain in 2001. The mother and son had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. The mother and son were from a village in Leon province. The third fatality in that province was a woman, 50, a local government worker, who died in December 2007. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid."}]}

His plane touched down in the capital, Tegucigalpa, in the afternoon. Thousands of supporters cheered his arrival at the airport. While Zelaya has entered Honduras since the military roused him in his pajamas and sent him into exile, Saturday marked the first time he returned without fear of prosecution. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat, Zelaya addressed his supporters, calling on them to pursue peaceful, democratic change. \"The problem of poverty, of corruption ... will not be solved with violence, but through more democracy, greater citizen participation and better transparency,\" he told a roaring crowd. Zelaya this month inked an accord with the country's current president that allowed him to return. Most recently, he has been in exile in the Dominican Republic. The deal, which was brokered by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments, was signed in Cartagena, Colombia, by Zelaya and Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. It allowed Zelaya and his allies to return to Honduras and helps clear the way for the country to rejoin the Organization of American States. Zelaya and his supporters will also be permitted to participate in Honduran politics. \"I hope the reconciliation plan serves to unite the family of Honduras,\" Zelaya told CNN en Espanol, from the plane that took him to Honduras. \"I am a peaceful man. I am a Christian and I do not hold a grudge.\" He said he does not immediately intend to run for president. Zelaya, who alienated many by his insistence on pursuing constitutional changes that might have allowed him to seek re-election, nonetheless counts with many allies. His supporters in Tegucigalpa prepared banners and posters this week to pass out to those who would gather to welcome him back. Yet many others are not thrilled. Even several of the country's news networks refused to cover Zelaya's arrival. Cholusat Sur broadcast images of his return. \"I think that this will create more problems for the country,\" university student Daniel Melendez said prior to the former leader's arrival. \"There is going to be a repeat of what there was before.\" Zelaya was overthrown on June 28, 2009, and flown into exile. He sneaked back into Honduras in September of that year and got refuge in the Brazilian Embassy, where he remained holed up until Lobo arranged for Zelaya to get safe passage out of the country. Honduras has been excluded from the Organization of American States since the coup, in part because Zelaya had not been allowed to return home without fear of prosecution. He faced corruption charges, which were dropped this month. The de facto government that replaced Zelaya was eventually replaced by the elected government of Lobo. But because the election happened under the rule of the de facto forces, some countries have not recognized the election results. Many countries, including the United States, have recognized the Lobo government, while others, such as Brazil, have not. Zelaya's return to Honduras is expected to help further reintegrate Honduras into the international community. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN."}]}

A 40-10 Thanksgiving day thrashing of Green Bay had the Lions in control of the NFC North, but that was their only win in their last seven games. Detroit finished 7-9 with four straight defeats and third behind the Packers and Bears. 'The switch from coach Schwartz to coach Caldwell has been good,' Suh said. 'Coach Caldwell is very transparent and understands what he needs from you as a player and a very open communicator. 'He is a guy I have grown to like as I have got to know him more and more and is good for Detroit. 'It was tough last year to see that all unfold the way it did. There were a lot of things we know we could have done better. Unfortunately that's the way the ball fell and we were outside the playoffs and couldn't find a way to get in. 'It is something that I have personally forgotten and moved past. This is a new season and we are off to a fairly decent start and hope to finish the first half on a really good note.

Scientists are using the world's biggest telescope, buried deep under the South Pole, to try to unravel the mysteries of tiny particles known as neutrinos . The discovery could shed light on how the universe was made. The mega-detector, called IceCube, took 10 years to build 8,000ft below the Antarctic ice. At one cubic km, it is bigger than the Empire State building, the Chicago Sears Tower - now known as Willis Tower - and Shanghai's World Financial Center combined. The final Digital Optical Module (DOM) descends down a bore hole in the ice as it is deployed in the IceCube array, the world's largest neutrino observatory, built under the Antarctic tundra near the US Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station . The IceCube array uses strings of sensors taht are lowered down deep boreholes in the ice. The IceTop has two layers of detectors just below the surface. The Eiffel Tower is depicted, bottom right, to show the detector's size . Very little is known about neutrinos, . but they are believed to carry information about the birth of our . galaxy and the mystery of black holes. Physicists think that they are born . when violent cosmic events, such as colliding galaxies or distant black . holes, occur at the very edges of the universe. Able . to travel billions of light years through space without being absorbed . or deflected either by magnetic fields or by atoms, these mysterious . high-energy particles could provide answers to some of the most . fundamental questions about the universe. Designed to observe neutrinos, which are emitted by exploding stars and move close to the speed of light, the telescope is attracting new attention in the wake of last week's discovery of a particle that appears to be the Higgs boson - a basic building block of the universe. \u2018You hold up your finger and a hundred billion neutrinos pass through it every second from the sun,\u2019 said Jenni Adams, a physicist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, who works on IceCube. IceCube is essentially a string of light detectors buried in the ice through hot water drilling. When neutrinos, which are everywhere, interact in the ice, they produce charged particles that then create light, which can be detected. The ice acts as a net that isolates the neutrinos, making them easier to observe. It also protects the telescope from potentially damaging radiation. \u2018If a supernova goes off in our galaxy now, we can detect hundreds of neutrinos with IceCube,\u2019 Adams told reporters at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Melbourne. \u2018We won't be able to see them individually, but the whole detector will just light up like a massive fireworks display.\u2019 Artist's impression of a 'Cerenkov light cone' passing through the IceCube telescope, left.

Scientists are attempting to track the particles to discover their points of origin, in the hope that will give clues on what happens in space, particularly in unseen parts of the universe known as dark matter. Before IceCube was completed in 2010, scientists had observed just 14 neutrinos. With the huge new instrument, paired with another telescope in the Mediterranean, hundreds of neutrinos have been detected. So far, all of those have been created in the earth's atmosphere, but IceCube scientists hope to eventually detect those from space. \u2018Neutrinos ... will point back to where they came from,\u2019 Adams said."}]}

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over divorce cases, granted a motion by attorney Larry Ginsberg to withdraw from the case on Wednesday. Judge Mark Juhas, who was slated to preside over the trial, ordered the proceedings to be delayed until January 5 to give Collins' estranged wife Faye Grant time to find a new lawyer. Scroll down for video . The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after the attorney of his estranged wife Faye Grant withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin . The former couple had been scheduled to start an eight-day trial on how to divide their assets and how much spousal support Grant should receive. Collins, who starred in the series 7th Heaven, was not present in court.\u00a0Grant represented herself at a hearing in which the trial was delayed and her estranged husband's lawyer sought to reduce her spousal support payments. The case has been complicated by the release of audio in which the actor purportedly acknowledges molesting underage girls. Collins, 67, has lost roles as a result of the recording, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming film Ted 2. The leaked recording has cost Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks . His attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said on Wednesday that the actor was also losing residual income on the 7th Heaven series. Kaplan said having Ginsberg withdraw hours before the trial's start would be 'visiting a terrible hardship on Mr. Collins.' He said the actor has spent $1 million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay would probably cost him another $200,000. The decades-old molestation allegations are being investigated by authorities in Los Angeles and New York. The actor has not been charged. Collins contends that his estranged wife should receive no support because the recording from a 2012 couple's counseling session and its subsequent posting by celebrity website TMZ has destroyed his career. Gordon ruled on the motion after meeting in closed session with Ginsberg and Grant. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, left, . Kaplan, Collins' attorney, was kept out of the proceedings so that Ginsberg could give details on why he was leaving the case abruptly. Gordon said Ginsberg's motion was not motivated by an effort to delay the trial and that there was a complete breakdown in the lawyer's communications with Grant. Collins filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year. Grant has said she gave police the audio only after Collins refused to seek appropriate treatment. Grant has denied giving the recording to TMZ. Grant, who is an actress who has said in court filings she put her career largely on hold during her marriage to Collins, is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments. Juhas refused a request on Wednesday by Kaplan to reduce Collins' support payments immediately. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as All the President's Men, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and recurring roles on TV series after 7th Heaven concluded its 11-season run in 2007."}]}

Shops and streets at Tahrir Square were closed as Morsy supporters and critics threw rocks at one another. At least 121 people were injured, a spokesman for the health ministry said. Thousands turned out for the protest, with some groups chanting, \"Leave Morsy.\" Protesters threw Molotov cocktails at one another, and firecrackers sounded amid clashes around Tahrir and Talat Harb squares. Read more: Should U.S. worry about Morsy? Witnesses said protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood attacked and destroyed a stage built by right-wing groups that criticize Morsy. The Brotherhood said two of their buses were burned near Tahrir Square and their headquarters was burned in Mahala. The same protesters that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 were scheduled to meet in five locations Friday and march toward Tahrir Square around 3 p.m. \"We want retribution for all the martyrs of the revolution. Those Mubarak cronies released from prison for the camel attack must return behind bars, and we also demand a drafted constitution that represents all factions in a civil democratic language,\" Rami Shaath told CNN, explaining the main demands of the nationwide protest. Shaath, a founding member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, a bloc of secular and religious parties, was referring to the February 2011 \"Battle of the Camel,\" street violence in which regime supporters, backed by men on horses and camels, attacked opposition demonstrators. He says he wants to keep Egypt's revolution going while the media covers Morsy's political maneuvers. The acquittal Thursday of all suspects detained in relation to the battle last year has sparked a wave of discontent among youths and the Islamic movement across the country -- especially since 24 of those suspects were former senior members of Mubarak's regime. Most of the officers charged with killing more than 800 protesters during the uprising have not been convicted. \"We also want the retrial of Mubarak, his Minister of Interior Habib El Adly and the seven chief police officers accused of killing the martyrs,\" Shaath said. Many people relate the latest wave of acquittals to the removal of General Prosecutor Abdul Majid Mahmoud on Thursday night. \"The general prosecutor submitted his resignation to the president, and he appointed him as an ambassador to the Vatican,\" presidential spokesman Yaser Ali told CNN. Mahmoud's removal has been a top demand during the many \"million-man\" protests that followed Mubarak's ouster. In a tone of defiance, Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's official spokesman, released a statement saying that the prosecutor has not resigned and that he will continue his business as usual, as the judicial system bans the president from firing the general prosecutor. iReport video: Clashes in Tahrir Square . \"He is a corrupted man appointed by Mubarak, and it would be a disgrace to the Vatican if this is true,\" said Mohamed Farhat, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Many people who followed the revolution know the vital role the young revolutionaries took in sparking the uprising against Mubarak. The same personalities that toppled the regime have been discreetly applying pressure by mobilizing laborers to demand more rights and better pay. Activist Gigi Ibrahim and her husband, Hossam El-Hamalawy, a member of the Socialist movement, have supported the laborers and helped them strike against the government, including this week's action by doctors, in which people in hundreds of public hospitals took part in a partial strike and demanded higher wages. More than 30,000 people took part, the Ministry of Health said. \"If the government does not provide to the people, we may see a 'revolution of the hungry' next,\" Ibrahim said. The political duo, along with certain right-wing groups, also aided last week's general transportation strike. \"They all wanted to revolt demanding better pay, so we helped them by providing lawyers, organizing meeting points and involving media to pressure Morsy to accomplish what he promised to do\" Ibrahim told CNN. Morsy on Wednesday announced a presidential decree to pardon all those arrested between the January 25 uprising and June 2012. The revolutionaries welcomed the decision with some reservations. \"What are the criteria they are using to identify the true revolutionaries from the thugs? No cop has been convicted for killing us, and now, Mubarak's former NDP (National Democratic Party) members are loose after they hired men on camels who charged into Tahrir Square, beating us with whips and sticks,\" Shaath said. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Wednesday to remember the 27 protesters killed by the army on October 9, 2011, in what has become known as the Maspero Massacre. Protesters demanded the arrest and trial of Gen. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the former head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which was running the country then. Dozens of political parties and movements, along with the Muslim Brotherhood, say they will join the protests. Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a former presidential candidate, has announced that members of his party will protest on courthouse steps across the nation. Morsy, in his latest presidential speech, announced that he had completed 75% of his promises in regards to security, traffic and garbage removal. A court ruling this month is expected to dissolve an assembly appointed to draft a new constitution. Islamic movements hold 80% of the seats, according to lawyer Sameh Ashour, a member of the assembly. \"If the court dissolves the assembly, then President Morsy will appoint the new team. I hope he does not please his Muslim Brotherhood supporters and remain fair for all sects -- women, Coptics and legal constitutional experts,\" Shaath said.

Prince Charles, Oprah Winfrey and Richard Branson were among the mourners at the state funeral of the anti-apartheid icon, who died 10 days ago at the age of 95. It was the second time this week that hundreds of well-known figures had gathered in honour of Mandela, after his memorial service at a Johannesburg football stadium on Tuesday.

The mourning was led by Mandela's widow Graca Machel and his ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who sat dressed in black on either side of South Africa's current president Jacob Zuma. Other family members included the former leader's daughter Makaziwe and Zindzi, as well as his grandson Mandla, who is now head of the Mandela clan. Prince Charles, who described Mandela as the 'embodiment of courage and reconciliation' after his death, represented Britain at the state funeral. Bill Clinton was also due to attend the ceremony, five days after he joined Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter at the star-studded memorial service. The world of showbusiness was represented by actors Forrest Whitaker and Idris Elba, the British star who plays Mandela in a new film based on his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.

Prince Albert of Monaco and former French prime ministers Lionel Jospin and Alain Jupp\u00c3\u00a9 were also among the guests today. The number of well-known people invited to the funeral has been a source of controversy, as a number of Qunu residents were barred from attending, instead watching the proceedings on a big screen erected nearby. Mr Zuma was just one of many African leaders who travelled to the village, and he gave a eulogy in which he praised Mandela as a 'beacon of hope'. 'It is the end of an extraordinary journey that began 95 years ago,' he said. 'It is the end of 95 glorious years, of a freedom fighter, a dedicated and humble servant of the people of South Africa. 'Fountain of wisdom, a pillar of strength, and a beacon of hope for all those fighting for a just and equitable world order. Your long walk to freedom has ended in a physical sense - our own journey continues.' Tribute: Mandela's granddaughter Nandi said 'Go well Madiba' as she delivered her eulogy . Coffin: Mandela's coffin was wrapped in a South African flag to mark his importance as a national leader . ANC deputy leader Cyril Ramaphosa, who was responsible for organising the proceedings, said: 'As we celebrate Madiba's life, we also remember important concepts that Madiba taught us - tolerance and forgiveness.' Other African dignitaries at the service included Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Zambia's first president Kenneth Kaunda, who gave an impromptu speech. However, the most moving tributes to Mandela came from members of his family - granddaughter Nandi said: 'Go well Madiba. Go well to the land of our ancestors, you have ran your race.' Don Dabula, the family chaplain, said that Mandela 'gave his life for the sake of justice and freedom, who lived the world healing practices of forgiveness and inclusivity, compassion and integrity'. Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima added: 'A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers. We thank them for lending us such an icon.'"}]}

Sarah Broadfield, 34, feared she would never have children after spending \u00a315,000 on fertility treatment and two miscarriages that left her devastated. But when she became pregnant again in November last year, she began taking the 2p aspirin each day after doctors said her miscarriages were caused by her blood being too 'sticky'. Sarah Broadfield, 34, finally gave birth to son Alfie (pictured) after seven rounds of IVF and two miscarriages . After being diagnosed with Antiphospholipis syndrome, which is known to cause miscarriages in pregnant women, Mrs Broadfield (pictured left during her pregnancy) was told to take a daily aspirin . The aspirin helped prevent a miscarriage and baby Alfie (pictured) was born in August weighing a healthy 8lb . She had been diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes an increased risk of blood clots and miscarriage. However aspirin can help by thinning the blood, preventing this. Nine months later, her son Alfie was born in August 2014, weighing a healthy 8lb. Mrs Broadfield, a nurse, said: 'Finally holding Alfie in my arms after everything we've been through was the best moment of my life - and it's all thanks to me taking an aspirin a day.' She had married her 36-year-old husband Chris, an electrician, in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby, with hopes of eventually having two children. But, two years later, with no success, the couple went to see their GP for fertility tests. Although Mrs Broadfield had previously been diagnosed with endometriosis, doctors didn't believe this was affecting her fertility, but couldn't find another explanation. The couple were referred for IVF through the NHS but two rounds of treatment failed. 'The first failure was the most devastating because I really thought it would work,' Mrs Broadfield said. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is also known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage, although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. At least 15 per cent of recurrent miscarriages (having three or more miscarriages in a row) occur as a result of APS, and it is now recognised as the most common, treatable cause. Generally, if a woman is diagnosed with APS following miscarriages, she will be treated daily with low dose aspirin (75mg-150mg). Treatment with aspirin can  help pregnant women improve their chances of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there is about an 80 per cent chance of having a successful pregnancy. In April this year, U.S. scientists found low doses of the drug could improve the chances of conception and of having a live birth. It can help women who have recently lost a baby to conceive again . This could be because the drug increases blood flow to the womb, they said. 'Even though I knew it wasn't my fault, I blamed myself. I felt like I'd failed as a woman.' When a third IVF cycle failed, the couple scraped together their savings, as well as getting some help from their parents, and paid for a fourth attempt at a private hospital. They were delighted when Sarah became pregnant a few weeks later. At the six week scan, everything looked fine but, two weeks later, a second scan showed that she had suffered a 'silent miscarriage' and the baby had stopped developing in her womb. 'It was heart-breaking but we were reassured that at least I'd managed to become pregnant this time. 'When it happened for a second time though, we started to wonder if there was a serious problem,' she said. Following the two miscarriages at eight weeks, the couple were referred to the Liverpool Miscarriage Clinic and blood tests showed that Mrs Broadfield had Antiphospholipid syndrome (AS), a disorder of the immune system which causes an increased risk of blood clots. People with AS are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and artery clots, but the condition is particularly dangerous to pregnant women as it can lead to miscarriages. It's estimated that AS is responsible for one in six cases of multiple miscarriages, as well as one in six cases of deep vein thrombosis. For Mrs Broadfield, the condition did not explain why she hadn't become pregnant naturally - but did explain why she'd miscarried twice. She said: 'It was such a relief to know what was wrong and the solution seemed impossibly simple.' Because of its blood-thinning qualities, an aspirin a day has long been hailed as a means of preventing strokes and some experts say it could also reduce the risk of cancer. Doctors advised Mrs Broadfield the daily tablet throughout her pregnancy would thin her blood and dramatically reduce the risk of her miscarrying for a third time. So, the couple embarked on their final round of IVF, with two eggs from previous attempts being implanted. Mrs Broadfield married electrician husband Chris, 36,\u00a0in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby . At the 20 week scan doctors said Alfie was developing normally, but Mrs Broadfield said she was a 'nervous wreck' before every scan, 'waiting for them to deliver bad news' 'By that stage, we were wrung-out, emotionally and financially so we decided it would be our last go,' she added. Weeks later, she became pregnant with twins and started her 'aspirin therapy', as well as having an anti-clotting injection daily throughout the pregnancy. Sadly, at the six week scan, the couple were told that one of the foetuses had failed. But, despite their disappointment, they were relieved to see the second baby was developing normally. Aspirin, which helped her give birth to son Alfie, was 'modern day magic', Mrs Broadfield said . 'The doctors kept a really close eye on us, which was reassuring, but I was still a nervous wreck before every scan, waiting for them to deliver bad news,' she said. Superstitious, Mr and Mrs Broadfield even waited until the later stages of the pregnancy before preparing their baby's nursery. As her risk of having a stillbirth was heightened, the baby was induced at 38 weeks and the couple's baby boy Alfie came along on August 1st 2014. Mrs Broadfield described how holding her baby in her arms was a moment of both joy and terror. She said: 'Just after he was born, he went quiet and I panicked. Then we heard him cry and it was the best moment ever,' she said. She added: 'Holding him in my arms, it felt so surreal, as we'd waited so long to meet him.' The next day, they brought Alfie home and he continues to thrive. 'They have no plans to embark on more IVF but she knows what to do if another baby were to come along. 'If only I'd known that taking one aspirin a day could help me so much,' she said. 'It would have saved us a lot of heartache. 'I wanted to speak out to hopefully help any other women who might have this condition without knowing it. 'For us, the aspirin was modern day magic and we always keep a box in our cupboard now, just in case.'"}]}

Bayern came from two goals behind for a 4-3 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach while Dortmund surrendered a lead to lose 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim, who kept their hopes of avoiding the drop alive. Bayern's 29th league win from 34 matches gave them a record tally of 91 points -- fully 25 points clear of Dortmund, who had been the reigning champions. Veteran Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes was saying farewell to the Bundesliga after 1,011 games -- he will be replaced by Pep Guardiola next season -- and the match had an added poignancy because it was against one of his former sides. They looked like spoiling his party as they led Bayern 3-1 inside the first 10 minutes, but Franck Ribery with a double, also setting up Arjen Robben for the second half winner, left Heynckes beaming. \"I had the feeling the team were still at last Saturday's party to celebrate the league title,\" he told their official website. \"But the team slowly got the game under control and we played like we're used to in the second half. I realized my team wanted to win for me.\" Heynckes had fielded a full strength line-up tipped to start next Saturday's final but Austrian defender Martin Stranzl and striker Mike Hanke, on his farewell for Moenchengladbach, put the home side 2-0 ahead in the opening moments. Javi Martinez pulled one back for the champions before Havard Nordtveit made it 3-1. Bayern had conceded only 15 goals in the entire Bundesliga season going into the final match. Then came Ribery to the rescue with a fine strike on 18 minutes, an equalizer early in the second half and a cross for Robben to tap home the winner. Dortmund's opponents Hoffenheim were fighting for their Bundesliga life and it looked bleak for the strugglers when Robert Lewandowski put the home side ahead after just six minutes -- the 24th of the league campaign for the Polish star. Juergen Klopp's men should have added to their tally but with 13 minutes left Mats Hummels fouled Kevin Volland to concede a penalty and also limped off with a turned ankle, leaving him a possible doubt for next week's final. Sejad Salihovic leveled from the spot and four minutes later had a second penalty opportunity after home keeper Roman Weidenfeller fouled Sven Schipplock and was sent off. Salihovic netted the penalty and Hoffenheim held on to earn a relegation playoff against Kaiserslautern. \"We now draw a thick line under the Bundesliga season and see now if all the players are fit for the final,\" Klopp told AFP after the defeat. Elsewhere, Schalke 04 earned a Champions League spot for next season with a 2-1 win at SC Freiburg, who will have to settle for a Europa League place. Julian Draxler put Schalke ahead in the first half but Jonathan Schmid leveled for Freiburg just after the break. An own goal from Julian Schuster saw Schalke ahead again and left Freiburg in fifth place in the final standings. With Hoffenheim winning, Fortuna Dusseldorf were automatically relegated, losing 3-0 at Hanover. Stefan Kiessling stayed ahead of Lewandowski as the Bundesliga top-scorer as he sealed third-placed Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a last minute goal -- his 25th of the campaign."}]}

West Antarctica is warming almost twice as fast as previously believed, a new study shows, heightening fears of a catastrophic thaw that raise water levels from San Francisco to Shanghai. Annual average temperatures at the Byrd research station there have risen 2.4C (4.3F) since the Fifties, it said, one of the fastest gains on the planet and three times the global average. West Antarctica holds enough ice to raise world sea levels by at least 3.3m (11ft) if it ever all melted. Melting: A new study raises the alarm over rising sea levels due to climate change in the Antarctic . Heating up: On this map, the colour intensity indicates areas around Antarctica that are likely experiencing comparable warming to Byrd Station, which is marked by the star . That process would take centuries, but even a much more modest thaw could threaten low-lying areas and coastal cities across the planet. 'Continued summer warming in West Antarctica could upset the surface mass balance of the ice sheet, so that the region could make an even bigger contribution to sea level rise than it already does,' said David Bromwich, professor of geography at Ohio State University and senior research scientist at the Byrd station. 'Even without generating significant mass loss directly, surface melting on the WAIS could contribute to sea level indirectly, by weakening the West Antarctic ice shelves that restrain the region's natural ice flow into the ocean.' Low-lying nations from Bangladesh to . Tuvalu are especially vulnerable to sea level rise, as are coastal . cities from London to Buenos Aires. Sea levels have risen by about 20cm . (8in) over the past century. The . United Nations panel of climate experts projects that sea levels will . rise by between 18 and 59cm (7-24in) this century, and by more if a thaw . of Greenland and Antarctica accelerates. Byrd Polar Research Center, pictured in 1960: Due to its location some 700 miles from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an important indicator of climate change throughout the region . Andrew Monaghan, study co-author and scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that the new findings place West Antarctica among the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The rise in temperatures in the remote region was comparable to that on the Antarctic Peninsula to the north, which snakes up towards South America, according to the U.S.-based experts writing in the journal Nature Geoscience. Parts of the northern hemisphere have also warmed at similarly fast rates. Several ice shelves - thick ice floating on the ocean and linked to land - have collapsed around the Antarctic Peninsula in recent years. Once ice shelves break up, glaciers pent up behind them can slide faster into the sea, raising water levels. Patchy data: Since its establishment in 1957, . Byrd Station hasn't always been occupied and even after it was automated . it has been subject to frequent power cuts, so . scientists were forced to reconstruct readings . 'We've already seen enhanced surface . melting contribute to the breakup of the Antarctic's Larsen B Ice Shelf, . where glaciers at the edge discharged massive sections of ice into the . ocean that contributed to sea level rise,' Dr Monaghan said. 'The stakes would be much higher if a similar event occurred to an ice shelf restraining one of the enormous WAIS glaciers.' We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, a scientist claims. Two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. The amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all time low in September (see graphic above), with the total area covered now half what it was in the Eighties. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. He used climate models to suggest\u00a0 injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest. Researchers consider the West . Antarctic ice sheet especially sensitive to climate change, explained . Ohio State University doctoral student Julien Nicolas. Since the base of the ice sheet rests below sea level, it is vulnerable to direct contact with warm ocean water. Its . melting currently contributes 0.3mm to sea level rise each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d second to Greenland, whose contribution to sea level rise has been . estimated as high as 0.7mm per year. Due to its location some 700 miles . from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an . important indicator of climate change throughout the region. In the past, researchers haven't been able to make much use of the Byrd Station measurements. Data was often incomplete because nearly one third of the temperature observations were missing for the time period of the study. Since its establishment in 1957, the station hasn't always been occupied. A year-round automated station was installed in 1980, but it has experienced frequent power cuts, especially during the long polar night, when its solar panels can't recharge. Professor Bromwich and two of his graduate students, along with colleagues from NCAR and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, corrected the past Byrd temperature measurements and used corrected data from a computer atmospheric model and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations. Aside from offering a more complete picture of warming in West Antarctica, the study suggests that if this warming trend continues, melting will become more extensive in the region in the future, Professor Bromwich said. While the researchers work to fully understand the cause of the summer warming at Byrd Station, the next step is clear, he added. 'West Antarctica is one of the most rapidly changing regions on Earth, but it is also one of the least known,' he said. 'Our study underscores the need for a reliable network of meteorological observations throughout West Antarctica, so that we can know what is happening\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand why\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith more certainty.'"}]}

Politicians can frequently be found on the phone, but in the hands of sexting offender Anthony Weiner the device is an unfortunate reminder of the dirty habits that have left his campaign with an uphill struggle in the polls. Maybe he was innocently checking his schedule, but Weiner really ought to keep his cell phone in his pocket when he\u2019s addressing the New York public which is rapidly losing faith in him since his latest sexting scandal broke last week. One poll earlier this week has Weiner, 48, falling from front-runner to fourth place in two weeks, with 65 percent of voters citing his behavior as a major issue for his campaign. What's going on here then? Anthony Weiner can't resist playing with his cell phone while he supposed to be canvassing for votes . You've got mail: Anthony Weiner remains transfixed on his phone during Wednesday's mayoral candidates forum . On Wednesday Weiner along with several other candidates, including Bill Thompson and John Liu, attended a New York City Mayoral Candidates Forum at La Marina Restaurant, 348 Dyckman Street. But Weiner\u2019s attention appeared to be elsewhere as he remained glued to his phone while his rivals spoke. He does of course have a lot on his mind, with Sydney Leathers basking in the spotlight following her sexting revelations and his spokeswoman Barbara Morgan launching an expletive-laden rant at an ex-intern who wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering campaign. Morgan remains adamant she won\u2019t quit her job despite her behavior, but the sexting business just won\u2019t go away. Even when Anthony Weiner puts his phone down he appears to remain preoccupied with it until he finally gets his turn to talk . Weiner finally gives his phone a break and addresses the audience and his rival candidates . Weiner was quizzed about his now notorious alias, Carlos Danger, on the campaign trail on Thursday. In his first live, on-air interview since news of his latest sexting scandal broke, Weiner told Univision\u2019s Satcha Pretto that the bizarre alias was 'a joke between [him] and one person' (Leathers) and that he would 'not comment on it' further. Mayoral rival Rev. Erick Salgado has taken umbrage with Weiner over his choice name. Salgado said it was an insult to the Latino community and has demanded that Weiner apologize, reports Fox News. The underfire NYC mayoral hopeful also said he was happy for his critics to continue to look into his shady past, reports ABC. 'If people want to continue to look at my background and make fun of things in my personal life, they are welcome to,' he told the Spanish-language television station. It is an offer that few can resist, including Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who shared his medical opinion this week that Weiner is 'psychologically unfit' to be the mayor of New York City. 'Congressman King never wanted me to become mayor. I fight with him every single step of the way [on immigration overhaul] just like I will when I\u2019m mayor. I\u2019m not looking for Peter King\u2019s vote. In fact, I\u2019d be a little ashamed if I had it,' was Weiner's response to Pretto. Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month . Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, . Weiner's humiliated wife, have told People magazine that she began to . beat herself up because her husband returned to phone sex after they . stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up . more of her time. However, after returning to counseling, . she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he . continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including . 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by . making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media . appearances. While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claim in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband. 'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine. 'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine. 'Any woman could have understood that.' For Better: Huma Abedin (left - with her husband on their wedding day in 2010) decided to stay in her marriage to help Weiner and for their child Jordan (right) Fresh Revelations: New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner admitted to sexting 22-year-old Sydney Leather's (right) Indeed, Abedin and New York mayoral candidate Weiner let their friends know that their marriage might end. Their friends let People magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago. 'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.' However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Loyal: Huma Abedin, alongside her husband, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, speaks during a news conference at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters, Tuesday, July 23, 2013, in New York . However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son. 'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari. 'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?' Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son. 'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- The man suspected of shooting and killing two U.S. Air Force servicemen in Germany was seeking revenge because of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, according to a warrant issued on Friday for the suspect. The suspect, Arid Uka, is a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, according to German authorities. Prosecutors say Uka shot and killed two U.S. servicemen and wounded two others in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport. The arrest warrant for Uka lists two accusations of murder, three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official said Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. He also had links to an Islamist preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport. Another U.S. official on Thursday said that Uka was \"not on the radar screen\" of American authorities prior to the attack. The suspect is from Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, that country's interior minister, Bajram Rexhepi, told CNN. He cited the U.S. Embassy in Pristina as his source. The U.S. official with knowledge of the probe said Uka was a 1-year-old toddler when he moved to Germany, and that authorities believe Uka's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians. He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said. Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official. On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting. According to the warrant, Uka asked a recruit where he was being deployed. The airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to Afghanistan. Uka then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun. The suspect then entered the bus, screamed \"Alahu Akbar,\" and opened fire, killing the driver, the warrant says. Uka then shot two other passengers, wounding one in the head and the other in the chest, the warrant says. The suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed, it says. The suspect fled then fled into the terminal, where he was taken into custody by German federal police, according to the warrant. The suspect used a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased, Rhein said. One of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at Ramstein, and the second was part of a security forces team based in the U.K., an Air Force spokesman said. The bus was occupied by 15 members of a security forces team that was on its way to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan, the spokesman said. Zachary Cuddeback was one of those killed, his grandfather, Daniel Cuddeback, told CNN. It's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team. A statement from his family described Cuddeback as a hockey player and \"Army brat\" with especially strong roots in Missouri in Virginia who joined the Air Force in 2009 after a year at Old Dominion University. The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday identified the other victim as Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, 25, of Williamston, South Carolina. He had been assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron based out of the Lakenheath air base in Great Britain. The two wounded airmen were in a Frankfurt hospital, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, an Air Force spokesman said. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he was \"saddened and outraged\" by the attack. \"We will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place,\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said how upset she was by the incident, expressed her condolences to the troops' families and stressed that Germany will \"do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened.\" FBI agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. The FBI's main office in Germany is in the capital Berlin, he said, but it has a sub-office in Frankfurt. The offense is a federal crime both in the United States and in Germany, he said, and could be prosecuted in either location, although that will be determined later. However, the investigation will meet U.S. constitutional standards, he said. Authorities will be investigating the suspect's background and associates, likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records, Fuentes said. CNN's Ashley Hayes, Barbara Starr, Aaron Cooper and CNN investigative journalist Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of supporters of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi filled the streets of seven Yemeni provinces on Sunday, one day after Hadi escaped house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Hadi had been under house arrest for a month after he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels. But he escaped and released a statement saying he is still president, calling all political decisions made since September illegal and invalid. A nephew of the president was kidnapped Sunday by Houthi rebels, two security officials in Ibb province told CNN. The nephew, Nasser Ahmed Mansour Hadi, was heading to the seaport province of Aden, where the President fled after escaping from house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Protesters called for Hadi to stand against the Houthi coup. Sanaa saw the largest demonstrations urging Hadi to end militant occupation of Sanaa. \"The Houthis thought they could not be stopped, and it only took hours for them to fall in the eyes of the people. Yemen has a president and the people will stand with him to uproot the Houthi militants from Sanaa,\" Ali Al-Saedi, a protest organizer in Sanaa, told CNN. In Taiz, tens of thousands took to the streets to show support for the legitimacy of the president and condemn the continued Houthi takeover of the capital. They carried placards reading \"Out to militant rule, return of government institutions.\" Last month, Houthis attacked the presidential palace and ministerial Cabinet, forcing both the president and prime minister to resign. Houthi militants then put Hadi under house arrest. Since then, Houthis have failed to form a government or reach a deal with other political factions for the formation of a presidential council. The militants tightened their grip on power over the last month, but the House of Representatives has not met to accept Hadi's resignation. Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. The ruling General People's Congress party, headed by Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, which holds a majority of seats in parliament, said it will not push for a parliament vote to accept the resignation of Hadi. \"Hadi is the President of Yemen, since his resignation has yet to officially reach parliament. Yemen is still led by a constitutional elected president,\" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, the secretary general of the independent Justice and Building Party. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed to that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands. The Houthis' takeover of Sanaa stunned governments of Western nations, which pulled out diplomatic staff this month. As part of an investigation into Hadi's escape, Houthis on Saturday arrested dozens of their own security personnel who were responsible for watching him, a senior Houthi official said. Houthis arrested two people connected to Hadi -- his media secretary Yahya Al Arassi and his private physician -- after his escape, one of Hadi's advisers said. A senior official with a Sunni political party opposed to the Houthi takeover said that he backs Hadi's claim to the presidency. \"Hadi's withdrawal (of his resignation) would save the country and end the Houthi oppression of the Yemeni people,\" said Mohammed Al-Sabri, senior official of the Nasserite party. There already had been resistance to the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the South, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. Also opposed to the Houthis is the Sunni terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which exerts influence over many rural areas across the country. AQAP vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. Yemen's political turmoil could have an impact on the United States' fight against AQAP. The United States has long had a relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U.S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31.

Grant Miller, a senior officer with the UK Border Agency, told the royal party about a recent seizure of ivory hidden in . ball bearing parts and 12 live San Salvador rock iguanas from the . Bahamas found in the luggage of two passengers stopped at Heathrow . Airport. Prime Minister David Cameron was due to speak at the conference but his attendance was cut short so he could focus on the flooding in southern England. Mr Cameron dropped in at the summit but did not pose with the delegates and the royals for a 'family photo', and met leaders behind the scenes. It is hoped that the nations will sign a declaration that will commit them to a range of goals to combat poaching and illegal trade in animal parts. In a short address Foreign Secretary William Hague outlined the steps the conference would agree to take to tackle the 'unprecedented crisis'. He said there was 'some evidence to show how insurgent or terrorist groups can benefit from the trade' in endangered species, but the conference would result in a 'powerful declaration that will demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate this abhorrent trade'. Mr Hague said the countries represented would 'commit ourselves to treat poaching and trafficking as a serious, organised crime in the same category as drugs, arms or people trafficking'. He said: 'Poachers think they can act with impunity. We will show them they are wrong.'There should be no weak link, we will all seek out those who commit these atrocious acts and use the full force of our national and international laws to break these criminal empires.' Prince William\u2019s appearance at the summit comes days after he was photographed hunting - a decision described by animal rights campaigners as \u2018unfortunate\u2019. The prince spent the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag. William Hague (left) and David Cameron (right) both attended although the Prime Minister cut his visit short to focus on flooding in southern England . He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past. While the prince\u2019s passion for saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners. Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince\u2019s timing was unfortunate, but added: \u2018The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it\u2019s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.\u2019"}]}

Hypertension, which can lead to strokes, heart attack, kidney failure and death, is traditionally treated with medication and diet. The goal of most doctors is to keep their patient's blood pressure below 140 (systolic) / 90 (diastolic). But after reviewing mounds of evidence, a committee of experts now says the systolic number, especially in older people, can be higher at 150/90. And many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be. It is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines, but experts are estimating in the millions. The committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years. They were published online Wednesday in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines. According to the report, \"There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90. \"However, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 for those groups based on expert opinion.\""}]}

The 26-year-old, originally from Michigan, was the fastest qualifier in the heats and the semi-final. She continued her dominance when it mattered, winning gold in 12.76sec. Porter got out of the blocks powerfully and maintained her lead over France\u2019s Cindy Billaud, who finished strongly to take silver. The 26-year-old, who won World Championship bronze in Moscow last year and silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: \u2018This is my first gold medal for Britain so I couldn\u2019t be happier. I just focused on myself. \u2018We all train to get the gold \u2014 I focused on my lane and performed well when it mattered the most.\u2019 Germany\u2019s Cindy Roleder took bronze in 12.82sec. Ashleigh Nelson, 23, burst into tears after becoming Britain\u2019s first female sprinting medallist at the European Championships for 40 years, emulating 100m bronze won by Andrea Lynch in 1974. Head to head: Porter and Billaud of France compete in the women's 100m hurdles final . Front runner: Porter became the first British female to win European gold in sprint hurdles . Nelson, who describes herself as a tomboy who loves fashion, finished behind the versatile Dutch multi-eventer Dafne Schippers and France\u2019s Myriam Soumare. She had run a pb to get to the final and clocked 11.22sec to clinch her first medal at a major championships. \u2018I feel amazing as you can tell from the tears,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019m just so happy.

The men \u2014 Martyn Rooney, Conrad Williams and Matt Hudson-Smith \u2014 all won their semi-finals. Hudson-Smith, who is the youngest of the trio at 19, was helped by veteran Rooney. Podium finish: Ashleigh Nelson of Great Britain celebrates bronze in the women's 100 metres final . Cool customer: Matt Hudson-Smith secured his progression through the men's 400m heats . \u2018I had a few words of advice from Martyn saying just be comfortable, from my coach too who said just get to the final. I\u2019ve got a lot of good people around me.\u2019 Christine Ohuruogu won her 400m semi-final but looked laboured. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel fresh,\u2019 she said, \u2018But this is my first European Championships so I want to get a medal.\u2019"}]}

Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old. Despite the warning signs, doctors labelled Jade, now 12, a 'picky eater'. Ms Moss, of Cannock, Staffordshire, said: 'I knew the signs because I'd suffered from anorexia as a child. I begged the doctors for help, but they maintained that Jade was too young to have an eating disorder. Helpless: Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old, after suffering from anorexia brought on by cruel taunts from classmates . The youngster's problems began in June 2012, after school bullies branded her 'fat' and 'ugly'. Upset, Jade began to feel body conscious and started to restrict her diet, secretly throwing food away. The mother-of-ten noticed her daughter's lack of appetite and spoke to Jade, who confided about her troubles at school. Ms Moss complained to teachers, who reprimanded the bullies with a verbal warning. She said: 'I told Jade not to listen to the bullies, but it was no use.' Jade continued to restrict her food intake and by September 2012, Maxine was forced to take her to the GP. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat' But the doctor suggested Jade's lack of appetite was due to her being a 'picky eater'. A week later, she noticed Jade checking the calorie content on food packaging. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat. 'When I brushed my hair, clumps would fall on to the carpet, and my skin was becoming flaky too.' Jade then started skipping dinner, claiming she'd already eaten at a friend's house. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up' At school, she was secretly throwing her lunch away, surviving on just a nibble of a biscuit. Ms Moss said: 'Even treats wouldn't tempt her. 'While her brothers and sisters ate chocolate cake for dessert, Jade would only manage an ice lolly. 'With nine children at home, it was tough to keep track of Jade's eating habits. 'I couldn't force her to eat and the doctors would do nothing. I felt helpless.' By October 2012, Jade's weight had dropped from 4st 7lbs to less than 3st, leaving her severely dehydrated and suffering liver and kidney failure. She struggled to walk, her face was gaunt and her clothes hung limply from her frail body. Her breathing was shallow and she felt faint all the time. Shockingly, Maxine could feel Jade's bones after checking her chest when she complained of pains. It was the last straw and the youngster was admitted to Stafford Hospital, where she was diagnosed with anorexia. With a BMI of just 9, Jade was dangerously underweight. She was assigned a dietician, who encouraged her to eat small mouthfuls of food. But after ten days of refusing to eat, Jade was still severely dehydrated and her organs were failing, so she was fed through a tube. Jade said: 'The doctors told mum that I was in danger of dying if I didn't eat something.' While ex-husband Graham, 41, looked after Jade's brothers and sisters, Thomas, 18, Callum, 13, Graham, 11, Calvin, 7, Ellie-Mae, 6, Summer, 4, Ocean, 3, Alex, 2, Maxine stayed by Jade's bedside. Ms Moss begged Jade to eat and even sneaked in Jade's favourite takeaway, crispy chicken and egg fried rice to encourage her. After 11 weeks, Jade started to eat small meals. Getting better: Jade with her friend Billy about to attend her school prom a couple of months after her feeding tube was removed . 'The first time she swallowed a piece of crispy chicken I wanted to cry - there was a chance my little girl would make it, she said' Jade's appetite slowly began to improve and she returned home in December 2012 weighing 3st 7lbs. For the next six months, she received home visits from nurses, who checked her weight and progress, as well as counselling sessions, which she continues to receive to this day. In January 2013 - seven months after she dropped out - Jade went back to school, but, too weak to walk, she relied on a wheelchair to get around. She could only manage small meals, so relied on her feeding tube and protein shakes for nutrition. Finally, in February 2013, Jade's feeding tube was removed. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up. 'It's taken us a year and a half to get here, but I'm so pleased to see my little girl smile again. 'I want other mums to know that no matter how young the child, an eating disorder can still take hold, even if they don't fully understand it themselves.'"}]}

Death: Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door . Police failed to find a missing man who was lying dead in his bed for up to 12 days after overdosing on prescription painkillers, an inquest has heard. Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door. The body was only found when his sister broke in herself. A coroner said it was possible the man could have been saved had Hampshire Constabulary officers investigated properly, adding: \u2018The property could have been entered at any time.\u2019 Police have apologised, saying the officers involved had received \u2018refresher training\u2019 but should have checked the flat. They added that the probe was \u2018confused\u2019 and \u2018limited\u2019 but nobody was disciplined. Mr Khosah was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments. Police called at his home several times and posted notes through his door - but never tried to get in. Family friend Fabian Nicholas told the inquest that Mr Khosah\u2019s sister Simbo had given officers permission to force their way in. But police said there was no record of permission being granted. The body was discovered on August 4 by his other sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat and found him on his bed. The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court comes less than two weeks after the same force apologised for failing deaf pensioner Marion Jones, 89, who dialled 999 after falling at home. Street; The body was discovered on August 4 by his sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat on this road and found him on his bed . An officer from Hampshire Constabulary visited her home and simply left when she failed to answer the door. She was found dead inside five days later. 'We do have a situation where if the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed' Coroner Keith Wiseman . Pathologist Dr Sanjay Jogai said Mr Khosah had died from an overdose of prescription painkiller tramadol. He believed the time of death was three to five days before the body was found. Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded an open verdict, saying it was unclear whether Mr Khosah had taken his own life intentionally or by mistake. He was critical of the police investigation, saying: \u2018The property could have been entered at any time from July 23 onwards. \u2018This becomes intriguing because if he . had not in fact died at that stage then we do have a situation where if . the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed.\u2019 Hearing: The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) in Hampshire was told that Amar Khosah, 52, was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments . The Investigations Standards Team and Hampshire Constabulary\u2019s Professional Standards Department reviewed how the case was handled. Both concluded there was \u2018confusion among officers\u2019 about the status of Mr Khosah\u2019s disappearance. 'It was clear officers had not applied the force's missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa\u2019s property earlier' Superintendent James Fulton, Hampshire Constabulary . The reviews said: \u2018Officers did not . exercise enough urgency. The investigation needed greater continuity and . control. The concerns of the mental health worker should have made . officers increase the risk factor.\u2019 Superintendent . James Fulton of Hampshire Constabulary said: \u2018Once again I wish to . extend our sympathies to Mr Khosah\u2019s family. I recognise this has been a . very difficult time for them and that they have lost a much-loved . member of their family. \u2018While it cannot be concluded that the investigation, if managed differently, would have led to a different outcome, there is evidence that the investigation could have been concluded sooner if it had been graded appropriately. Concerns: A coroner said it was possible the 52-year-old could have been saved if officers from Hampshire Constabulary (whose headquarters in Winchester are pictured) had investigated properly . \u2018It was clear officers had not applied the force\u2019s missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa\u2019s property earlier. \u2018The Professional Standards Department (PSD) investigation concluded that no individual officer or police staff member had a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct. \u2018However, following the coroner\u2019s comments, PSD will review further what individual and organisational learning should follow. \u2018We have also assured Mr Khosah\u2019s family that all officers involved in this investigation are being spoken to and given refresher training on the problem areas highlighted. \u2018The force is reviewing policy to establish clearer guidance on the levels of risk and the correct categories of missing people, establishing clear standards of investigation for attending officers . \u2018Force training will support the roll-out of the amended policy.

Otto Perez Molina, a retired army general who pledged to take a tough stand on crime, garnered the most votes in Sunday's elections. With almost all of the ballots counted Monday night, Perez Molina had 36% of votes -- far short of the more than 50% needed to win outright. His closest competitor, businessman Manuel Baldizon, had 23% of votes, said Guatemala's election authority. Observers from the Organization of American States criticized Guatemalan election officials' apparent disorganization and slow vote-counting after Sunday's election, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The watchdogs said they hoped the process would improve in the second round of voting, scheduled for November 6. Dealing with widespread violence and the growing threat of organized crime figured heavily in the campaigns of all 10 candidates vying for the presidency. Baldizon championed a crime-fighting plan called \"Security Now!\" Campaign posters for Perez Molina, who led in polls before Sunday's election, featured a clenched fist.  The 60-year-old retired general pledged to bring a \"mano dura\" -- firm hand -- to Guatemala's highest office. In a debate co-hosted by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol last month, Perez Molina called for \"elite units of the army\" to play a larger role in the nation's battle against gangs and drug cartels. But that proposed approach -- and Perez Molina's high rank in the military during Guatemala's decades-long civil war -- worries human rights groups both in Guatemala and abroad. \"These groups have begun questioning his military past and his participation in the war against the insurgents during the armed conflict. Undoubtedly, this issue will be present during his presidency if he wins the elections,\" said Miguel Castillo, a political analyst at Guatemala's Francisco Marroquin University. Concerns stem from the fact that the Guatemalan military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war, though Perez Molina has never been directly implicated in any of them, Castillo said. Perez Molina is campaigning for president for a second time. He was defeated in 2007 by incumbent President Alvaro Colom. \"We would have liked to win in the first round, but we are prepared with a revision of plans and strategy to face the second phase of this electoral process,\" he said early Monday, according to AGN. First-time candidate Baldizon, 41, also said he was ready for the next round, AGN reported. The businessman and attorney, who is running under the banner of the Leader Party, has energized young people. His campaign slogan was \"Only the people can save the people.\" The youngest of all the candidates, Baldizon espouses a concept he calls \"renewed democratic liberty\" in which all members of society have a role to play in seeking solutions to common problems. \"In order to change Guatemala, we need a president who's really committed to our nation, with a calling for service, and who truly wants to change Guatemala,\" Baldizon said. Poverty is endemic in Guatemala, and the country has one of the worst crime rates in Latin America. Forty-three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. And the murder rate last year was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world. In a Vox Latina national survey in July, more than two-thirds of Guatemalans said violence was the issue that concerned them most, far outpacing the combined totals for the economy, unemployment, poverty and lack of education. This is only the fourth time that Guatemala has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996, officially ending a civil war that devastated the Central American country for 36 years. The conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees. The new president will take office in January. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice, and journalist Patzy Vasquez contributed to this report."}]}

Both men were known to MI5 \u2013 especially Adebolajo, 29, who was arrested in Kenya in 2010 attempting to cross the border into Somalia to fight for the African terror group Al Shabaab. He was passed to British spies. Drummer Lee Rigby was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside Woolwich barracks last year . In the months leading up the brutal murder in May last year, the killer was also posting extremist material on the internet. Despite their history of extremism MI5 assessed the pair as not posing a sufficient danger to require full monitoring. In a long-awaited report set to be published tomorrow Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee will insist that MI5 cannot be blamed for failing to track the pair. It will claim that the domestic security organisation was unaware of the extremist material they were posting on the interest which could have alerted them to the fanatical intentions of the killers. Internet service providers \u2013 who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services \u2013 did not alert them it was there.

Adebolajo has claimed spies attempted to turn him into an informant after he was arrested in Kenya in 2010.

The committee used its powers to read MI5 files about Adebolajo and Adebowale as well as to interview MI5 head Andrew Parker. After Drummer Rigby\u2019s murder, several witnesses said Adebolajo had complained of his treatment by the security services, the Guardian has claimed. Adebolajo and Adebowale, both converts to Islam, had been known to the security services for up to eight years before the attack. Adebolajo went to Kenya in 2010, where he was arrested as he attempted to join extremists in Somalia."}]}

The child, who has not been named, narrowly topped the list of the most obese children in Coventry and Warwickshire, where the data was collected. The Year 6 pupil tipped the scales at 19st 7lbs, making them one of the heaviest children in the country. Another child of the same year weighed just over 18st, a third weighed 18st 6lbs and a fourth weighed 16st 7lbs. Shocking: The 10-year-old child, who has not been named, is one of the fattest children in the country (file picture) The children were weighed at school as part of an annual child measurement programme and it is now known if they were male or female. The latest data has been supplied by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the official source of NHS data. Coventry City Council estimates there are about 10,000 primary school children in the area who are classed as either overweight or clinically obese - including a handful of local youngsters who weighed in at more than 16st during health checks in Year 6. Many will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases. National figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre in December revealed the proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight had actually fallen for the first time in six years. A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - . measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 . were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous . year. In Reception, the number of obese and . overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year . and is lower than seven years ago. And . in December, it was revealed a ten-year-old schoolgirl in Birmingham . weighed at 22 stone 11lbs, closely followed by six youngsters of the . same age who weighed 19 stone. Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline: 'It is a truly . horrific problem we have. The Government says obesity is falling in . children, which it might be in affluent areas. Denial: Experts say many parents believe nothing needs to be done about their overweight children - because they 'look healthy and happy' 'But in many cases, it's about volume - fat people are getting fatter. Also, many parents don't realise their child is overweight - quite often because they are fat themselves. 'It is horrific figures such as these which show just how big the problem of childhood obesity is becoming.' Berni Lee, public health consultant for Coventry City Council, said the main challenge is changing the attitudes of parents with overweight children who believe nothing needs to be done because theirchild looks healthy and happy. A recent survey suggests most parents ignore advice offered by the National Child Measurement Programme. She added: 'We\u2019ve become accustomed to the overweight because it\u2019s so common in our society. 'We are not recognising it when we see it because people only hear about the extreme cases, people think it\u2019s an extreme state. 'The 19-and-a-half stone child is not the problem, although it\u2019s a problem for them. 'The problem is the [other] children...who are either overweight\u00a0 or very overweight.

Passed away: Zac Knighton-Smith, pictured, passed away on New Year's Day . A boy who spent more than half his young life has died after a battle with the same rare brain cancer which killed his cousin. Zac Knighton-Smith, nine, passed away on New Year's Day from an agressive neuroblastoma. He had been diagnosed with the condition in February 2009, aged four. And just six months after the diagnosis his cousin, Chelsea Knighton, died from the condition aged three. When he first fell ill aged four, two doctors missed the symptoms of his cancer. It took six months to diagnose him as suffering from a form of the disease called neuroblastoma, which affects the developing nerve cells of children. After chemotherapy at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2009, the NHS paid for Zac to go to Germany for a first time to have antibody therapy. While there, doctors removed a tumour near his heart which, incredibly, his family had not even been told about. Zac was given the all-clear, but a follow-up scan revealed three cancerous lymph nodes in his abdomen. The NHS originally refused to fund potential lifesaving surgery at a German hospital for Zac, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, which led his family to start a desperate fundraising campaign. They found the \u00c2\u00a38,000 needed for the operation, and were delighted to be told in March 2011 that Zac was in remission. The family were also reimbursed the cost of the treatment by the NHS after Conservative MP Peter Bone intervened on their behalf. Packed up: Zac, pictured in 2012 with his parents Bob Smith and Sam Knighton before his trip to Germany . Following intervention from their local Tory MP Peter Bone the NHS did a U-turn and reimbursed the family for the costly treatment. But the cancer later spread to Zac's liver and he passed away at his home on 1 January alongside his parents, Bob Smith, 44, and Sam Knighton, 45. Diagnoses: Zac, right, with his cousin Chelsea, after both had been diagnosed with neuorblastomata . His mother yesterday said he wasn't in any pain but confirmed his health had been ailing because the disease had spread to his liver. Ms Knighton said: 'We took him to America as our last-ditch attempt in November to a specialist oncologist, who was also a scientist. We found out then it had spread to his bone marrow. 'We knew then that we had one hell of a fight. But at that point it wasn't in his liver. But that's the nature of the disease, it can happen that quickly. 'All over Christmas he deteriorated. We knew he didn't have long, he was poorly. Christmas will never be the same again.' Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Bone said Zac will be 'greatly missed'. Addressing Commons Leader Andrew Lansley in the chamber, he said: This lovely, full-of-life, happy little boy passed away. He will be sadly and greatly missed. 'However, without politicians of different parties working together he would not have had the last five years.' Any funds raised by Zac's Fight Appeal, which has been raising money for his treatment, will now be used to help other children and their families fighting the disease. Ms Knighton added: 'This country offers nothing for relapse neuroblastoma. If you take accidents out of the equation, this disease is the single biggest killer of children. 'How many more children have to die before something is done about it? This can't be allowed to happen.'"}]}

A Spanish team reported the eclipsing of a star system, known as MY Camelopardalis, when they saw two huge stars circle in a very close orbit. The star system is nestled within a small open star cluster, named Alicante 1, located about 13,000 light-years from Earth. Astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal, for the first time, how supermassive stars are born (artist's impression pictured) Our sun is a relatively rare star in its isolation. Most of the stars in our galaxy have been formed in binary or multiple systems, some of which are \u2018eclipsing\u2019. Currently, the stars in My Cam are moving around each other at speeds of 621,000 miles (1 million km) per hour and are estimated to be no more than two million years old. Each has a radius around 700 times bigger than the Earth's, but turns on itself at about the same time. By watching the two stars with the 7.2ft (2.2 metre) telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. By watching the two stars with a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. Pictured is an artist's impression of a binary star system . The stars, which each have 38 and 32 times the mass of our sun, are also thought to complete orbits of each other in under 1.2 days. This means that their outer atmospheres are already touching and interacting, and are so close to each other that scientists believe they will eventually merge into one. The resulting star is estimated to have at least 60 times the mass of the sun, according to the study by the University of Alicante. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other.Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups . You can call them celestial orphans, stars flung out of their galaxies in colossal collisions that have occurred in space for billions of years. These forsaken stars may be far more common than anyone ever realised. New observations from suborbital rocket launches and an orbiting observatory show that as many as half the stars in the universe may be this kind, scientists said in November. They found that the dim light these stars produce from the far reaches of the cosmos equals the amount coming from all the galaxies. The data was collected during 2010 and 2012 flights of a Nasa suborbital rocket with the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (Ciber) measuring background fluctuations in a compilation of all the light emitted by stars and galaxies in the universe's history. The researchers then checked the findings using Spitzer Space Telescope, an orbiting infrared observatory. The data indicated huge numbers of orphan stars, previously undetected, populate what had been thought to be the dark spaces between galaxies. So how did billions of stars become orphans? Violently, to say the least. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other. Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups, but some stars that were born and resided in these galaxies are stripped away and cast as debris into the cosmic wilderness. The phenomenon of the orphan star has been well known. Astronomers have witnessed tidal streams of stars being stripped away from colliding pairs of galaxies. Scientists are unsure what will happen next, but any merger is likely to be rapid and explosive, releasing massive amounts of energy. While it won\u2019t create a \u2018hypergiant\u2019 star, astrophysicists hope that by seeing the merger of such close binary stars, they can better explain how extremely massive stars form. Hypergiants may be 100 or more times more massive than the sun, and emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy. Although extreme stars such as these are believed to have been common in the early universe, today they are extremely rare - the entire Milky Way galaxy contains only a handful."}]}

Price: \u00a339.99 / $63.00 (RRP) She is one of the most iconic characters in video games. Her first outing on the PlayStation signalling the beginning of a new generation of gaming. Now, as the life of current gen starts to fade, who better than Lara Croft to celebrate the end of an era and offer us a glimpse of what's to come. But this is no 'normal' Tomb Raider, and Crystal Dynamics have worked tirelessly to reboot the series. Perhaps their biggest statement of intent is getting Terry Pratchett's daughter, Rhianna, to pen the story. Birth of an icon: All alone and battling the elements, Lara is ambushed by wolves early on in the game . As such, Lara is part of a team of archeologists that washes up on an island after a storm destroys their ship. Isolated and all alone, it's not long before Lara bumps into a bunch of crazed Sun God-worshipping locals called the Solari who are killing any 'outsiders' in an attempt to bring their deity back. How Lara deals with these obstacles help mould her from from naive, timid archeologist to gun-wielding femme fatale. It's a breathless ride from start to finish, broken up with set pieces that give the Uncharted games a run for their money. However, some may feel the whole 'you can do it, Lara' theme (primarily from Lara's mentor, Roth) and constant sign-posting is a tad strong. Still, this feels like a Tomb Raider game, albeit with a few welcome modifications. As the game progresses, Lara can upgrade her equipment and skills. These range from combat upgrades such as the ability to throw dirt in enemies' eyes, to enhanced survival instincts that improve salvage and hunting ability. Levels are well deigned, too, offering a surprising level of freedom in some parts. Often venturing off the beaten track rewards you with a secret tomb which can be explored for ancient treasures. It's a living, breathing island too. Hungry wolves roam the forest at night, while timid rabbits and deer can be seen grazing on the island's lush greenery. The game lets you hunt all of these, but it feels more like an optional extra than something necessary for her survival. Shine a light: When exploring dark caves and tombs, Lara can light a torch to help illuminate her path. When climbing ladders, though, Lara does not extinguish the torch and flames cover her face. Thankfully, this amusing feature does not cause her any damage . Combat is fast and frantic and the formidable enemy AI is a challenge whatever the difficulty. Lara has a variety of weapons available to her ranging from shotguns to assault rifles and pistols. By far the most fun to use is the bow (later modifications make it even better). It's brilliantly rewarding watching a well-placed arrow hit a foe - a grisly death animation shortly following. But the graphic deaths are not just for your foes, and - in similar vein to the previous games - Lara can meet her end in a number of gruesome ways. Whether it's being crushed by a rock, impaled on a spike or eaten by wolves, all are particularly disturbing given how realistically Lara is portrayed. This is thanks to actress Camilla Luddington, who conveys Lara's transformation brilliantly. She's sobbing her eyes out one minute, then boisterously taunting her foes the next. The developers have mentioned their admiration of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, and this influence is clear throughout - both in the in-game cinematography and the dark, tense orchestral score. Some gameplay decisions, however, may jar with fans. Although Crystal Dynamics have placed the odd puzzle here and there, this is very much an action game. Indeed, Lara's kill count by the end of the game reaches genocidal proportions, which may make her 'transformation' feel less believable. Run and gun: In fire fights, it pays to keep moving. If you stay in one place, enemies will throw firebombs and dynamite to flush you out from cover . Graphically, the game is strong - with impressive detail on even the most distant environmental features. Pop up is negligible and there's enough variation (although earlier levels are perhaps too dark) to keep the adventure from feeling stale. But it's Lara's animation that steals the show. What starts as cautious footsteps and clumsy clambering soon turns into graceful rock climbing and death-defying leaps. Not all of it is silky smooth, but more often than not it looks fantastic. Lara's facial animations, too, capture every drop of her initial doubt and anxiety, only to subtly become more confident and aggressive as the game goes on. Naturally, the game looks its best on PC. On 'Ultimate' settings, textures are eye-poppingly realistic, and draw distances put consoles to shame. Most notable, though, is Lara's hair. Gone are her blocky locks, replaced by a free-flowing, insanely realistic head of hair made possible by TressFx. The campaign offers between 8-10 hours or gameplay, and multiplayer adds some more longevity. However, although competent, multiplayer is not why you buy a Tomb Raider game. You buy it for the story and in that respect, Tomb Raider delivers in almost every way. Tomb Raider is out now. WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW HERE: .

Today, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the crime, detectives from the Robbery and Serious Crime Squad's Strike Force Lorimer have announced they have made a number of important breakthroughs in the case. 'We believe we know who is responsible for this offence and we are very close to being able to charge those people with the offence,' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore told a press conference. Police have been able to forensically link a vehicle used in the shooting of Mr Allibon \u2013 a stolen Audie S8 sedan \u2013 and the non-fatal shooting of a man in Wentworthville in April 2009. They have also identified another two cars that were involved in the crime, a white BMW X5, which has not yet been located, and a silver 2004 BMW 5-Series sedan, which was stolen during a violent car-jacking in Maroubra in July 2009. The breakthroughs were the result of scientific and technological advances and information provided to police by members of the public since 2010. Scroll down for video . Trail of crime: Police have linked various crimes to the gang who were involved in the armed robbery . Police investigating the fatal shooting of Gary Allibon in 2010 have linked three cars with the incident and released images of them from CCTV . Police have been able to forensically link a vehicle used in the shooting of Mr Allibon \u2013 a stolen Audi S8 sedan \u2013 and the non-fatal shooting of a man in Wentworthville in April 2009. Police are appealing for any information about the cars or the crime. They say that they are very close to being able to make arrests in this case . An emotional Monica Allibon spoke at a press conference about her sadness since her husband's death in 2010. 'I thought at four o'clock [this morning] when I woke up \u2013 four years ago I was happy, four years ago today I was happy,' she said. Mrs Allibon revealed that she met Gary, whom she described as 'a really nice guy' just six months after her previous partner had died, and they 'just gelled'. 'My husband was killed by someone who can only be described as a cold-blooded murderer,' she said. Mrs Allibon said that today was a particularly sad day in the lead up to the anniversary of Gary's death, which she will be marking tomorrow by having a mass said and then going to brunch with family. 'The murder of someone you love changes your life forever. I feel as empty today as I did the day of his death.' She added that there is never a day that goes past that she does not think of her husband and said that every time she sees a news report about a murder she is forced to relive her own loss. Detective Superintendent Moore said they still needed 'little pieces of information' before they could arrest the suspects and he called on the public to report any information they had about the crime to police so they could 'give Monica and her family the answers they deserve for the senseless death of Gary Allibon.' The crime occurred when Mr Allibon and another security guard were confronted by a group of armed men when they entered the foyer of a building on Sussex Street. Mr Allibon was shot in the back and the group stole some cash form the guards and fled in the silver Audi S8 sedan. Mr Allibon was treated at the scene before he was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital but died later. Detective Superintendent Moore called those involved in the crime 'well-organised' and 'cold-blooded' and said they were suspected of having links to known organised crime groups. Mr Allibon's widow, Monica, also addressed the press conference. She said she was happy with the progress police had made. She added that things had been 'difficult' and she was constantly reminded of her husband's death. Mrs Allibon added that knowing police were close to being able to arrest those responsible for her husband's death 'doesn't change my life, but it makes some difference to know that some justice has been served.' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore (left) spoke at a press conference about the developments in the investigation and Monica Allibon (right), spoke about the impact on her of the death of her husband . Mrs Allibon says that not a day goes by without her thinking about her former husband, who was killed four years ago ."}]}

Hidden public service cuts will drain Britain's poorest families of 30 per cent of their annual income by 2017, as the coalition's tough spending targets begin to bite, new TUC research reveals. It said reductions in benefits and family tax credits, combined with continuing cuts to welfare, will 'cause considerable financial harm for millions of families'. The dire predictions come as chancellor George Osborne prepares to deliver his autumn statement on December 5, in which he is expected to detail a further \u00a310bn of welfare savings over the next five years. 'Unless George Osborne changes course,' the TUC warned. 'These cuts will be dwarfed by massive reductions in public services.' Their figures revealed that by 2016-17, the cumulative cost of lost public services for the poorest ten per cent of household will be \u00a33,995 in cash terms - or 31.7 per cent of their average annual income. By contrast, the top tenth of the income scale will lose just \u00a32,805 - or 2.5 per cent of annual income. This is because higher earners may use public transport less frequently, opt out of public schooling or healthcare, and less likely to rely on Sure Start centres. The analysis also said that the average household had already lost more than \u00a31,200 in public services but the real pain is still to come - this is just a third of the cuts they are likely to experience by 2014-2015. The TUC report coincided with a study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which found that 6.1m people in working households live in poverty and more than 5.1m people live in working age households where no one has a job. Julia Unwin, the foundation's chief executive, told The Observer: 'The most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor.' Against the cuts: Protesters take part in a TUC march against the welfare cuts. Research by the Congress suggests that the poorest families could lose 30 per cent of their income as public services are withdrawn . Nick Davies, policy director at Children England, said on the scaling back back of children's services: 'Demand has increased, but funding reduced, and that has led to the withdrawal of some services and the rationing of others. 'Local authorities have to focus on their statutory responsibilities and other things get neglected.' Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, added: 'We are hearing reports from welfare rights advisers up and down the country that the services they provide are being cut or closed down. 'So a perfect storm is brewing: benefit cuts, service cuts and large-scale welfare reform.'"}]}

Yes, Microsoft's new tablet UI isn't merely utilitarian. It's actually innovative, and even cool. And in some ways it trumps the best that Apple and Google currently have to offer in iOS and Android, respectively. Here are five of our favorite new Windows 8 features. Picture password . We've known about Microsoft's picture password feature in Windows 8 since its developer preview was unleashed in mid-September. But now that we've had a chance to give it a spin, we can definitely say it's a fun, convenient alternative to other system unlocking methods. In a nutshell, you choose a photo for your lock screen, and then define three touch gestures to draw on top of the photo in order to unlock your device. When Microsoft first detailed picture password, some were skeptical: Won't evil hackers be able to figure out your gesture-based password based on the smudges you leave on the display? In a blog post, Microsoft said no: \"Because the order of gestures, their direction and location all matter, it makes the prospect of guessing the correct gesture set based on smudging very difficult even in the completely clean screen case, let alone on a screen that sees regular touch use.\" In that same blog post, Microsoft provided a detailed mathematical explanation of why a picture-based password is every bit as secure, if not more so, than a PIN-based one. And independent security experts agree that the likelihood of someone being able to decipher the intent of smudges on your device is slim to none. Of course, character-based passwords and number-based PINs are an old standby. Apple uses four-number passcodes in iOS. They're quite secure, but not particularly innovative. Google is more creative with its unlock security, offering a facial recognition-based unlocking feature in its Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich OS. This, however, has proven not to be so secure. In fact, it can be defeated if you hold up a picture of the Android device owner at the right distance from the display. Easy gesture-based app switching . In the Ice Cream Sandwich version of Android, Google has added a \"Recent Apps\" feature that pulls up a listing of most frequently used apps when you click the system bar icon. But in Windows 8, switching between open apps is much more intuitive and easy: A swipe from the left edge of the device will immediately pull up the last app you used (assuming it's still open in a multitasking state). It's a natural gesture, and one you'll rarely use by accident. And best of all, it's fast \u2014 like channel surfing for the tablet era. And how's this for clever: If you know you have a large number of apps open, you can simply swipe back and forth on the edge of the screen, and up pops a vertical array of preview windows revealing all your running programs (see screenshot above). From here, you can tap on a preview to jump to a specific app. Again: another solution that's easy, quick and elegant. In the iPad version of iOS 5, you're given two strategies to jump between apps. Most people will double-tap the home button to reveal a lineup of icons of all open apps. From there, a simple icon tap will jump to the new app. That's the popular method. But iOS 5 for iPad also lets you swipe from open app to open app, much like the method in Windows 8. But there is one hitch in the iOS approach: You have to use a full four fingers to execute the swipe. Compared to the Windows 8 gesture, it's just not that natural. Fat fingers aren't a problem . One problem many mobile users suffer is that onscreen keyboards aren't designed for a variety of hand and finger sizes. This is typically less of a problem on tablets, which usually have enough screen real estate to offer accommodating keyboards. Nonetheless, if you plan on using your tablet two-handed, typing with your thumbs, typing on a tablet isn't so easy. Windows 8 offers a solution: It provides a split-screen keyboard so you can type with your thumbs. But wait, you say \u2014 Apple already does this in iOS 5. This is true, but Windows 8 goes one step further: You can adjust key size in the Windows 8 split-screen keyboard. You have three sizes to choose from, so if you've got the petite hands of a five-year-old, you can type on the small setting, and if you've got manly man hands, you can increase key size to large. It's not an insanely revolutionary feature, but little UI nuances like this make Windows 8 so appealing in total. Chromeless, fullscreen app experiences . Windows 8 also innovates with a unique, tablet-optimized approach that eliminates distracting \"chrome\" \u2014 in other words, all those busy interface elements that can junk up a desktop or app interface. In fact, it's an OS-wide theme of Windows 8\u2032s Metro UI. There are no menu bars, task bars, or navigational buttons permanently pinned to the display. In many iOS apps, you'll find navigational buttons that persist across the app's entire user experience. And even for apps that don't do this, you'll often still see that thin bar at the top of the screen that shows data connection strength, the time, and battery level. These are the very same elements that are locked to the iOS home screen. The case is similar (and arguably worse) in Ice Cream Sandwich. You've got your three virtual navigation buttons at the bottom of the display that are persistent across the UI. You also often have a bar across the top of the screen (just like in iOS) that displays battery status, time, and icons that link to other information. Windows 8 does away with all of this. To see the time, battery strength and data connectivity, you swipe open your Charms menu. Once you're done looking at these simple reports, you touch anywhere on the screen, and the Charms menu disappears. When I was younger, I was obsessed with knowing the time, so the new Windows 8 approach would have driven me nuts. But now it's liberating to keep the clock out of view \u2014 until I actually need it. Just check the time when you need to, and enjoy a much less busy user interface for 99 percent of your time on the tablet. Metro apps can luxuriously take up your tablet's full screen, and in cases where there's photo or video involved, that's fantastic. Home screen style and utility . Every major mobile OS provides a certain degree of personalization in what you see in your home screen. In iOS, you can rearrange your home screen app icons so you can put your favorite ones front and center. In Android, you can organize the placement of app icons, and also add widgets that display real-time information, making the home screen both personalized and a source of useful information. However, Android widgets tend to have their own developer-specific themes and designs, so when they intermingle on your home screen, the resulting arrangement may look busy and inconsistent like a chaotic patchwork quilt. In Windows 8, however, you'll find a happy medium between the tidy organization that iOS provides, and the freedom and utility of the Android home screen. In Windows 8, app icons are live tiles, either square or rectangular in shape, but always consistent in their basic look and feel. But live tiles also update with new information in real time, just like an Android widget. For example, the mail app provides a constant refresh of your latest message headers. You can organize live tiles in whatever order suits you best. In the screenshot above, we put the calendar, mail and weather apps on the far left so we could glean that information with a single downward glance. See the original article on WIRED .

From weepy ballads to stirring instrumentals, many pieces of music have been described as powerful or moving. But now there\u2019s a musical instrument that actually generates power when it is played - and it could provide light in poor and remote communities. The percussion shaker, called Spark, generates electricity that can charge a phone, or power a lamp after just 12 minutes of movement. Scroll down for video . A bright idea: A musical instrument called Spark (pictured) generates power when it is played, and 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light a home for an hour, or to charge a phone. It has a USB port so that a lighting strip can be attached (also pictured) When Spark is shaken, a magnet moves backwards and forwards through the centre of a solenoid - a coil of copper wire. A current is induced in the loops of wire and each time the magnet slides through, it charges up a rechargeable battery. Because the energy is stored, Spark can be played in the morning and the electricity generated, used later in the dark. Around 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light someone\u2019s home for an hour. It is the brainchild of Sudha Kheterpal, who has been a percussionist with dance band Faithless for 15 years. She hopes her innovation - which she\u2019s raising money to put into production on crowd funding site Kickstarter \u2013 will improves the lives of people in Kenya, where three quarters of the population have no access to electricity. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but play an important electricity-generating role, as well as making noise. The motion forces a magnet to move through a copper coil to make a current, which charges up a battery. More than 12 minutes of shaking can light up someone\u2019s home for an hour. \u2018I've tested the prototype with a number . of different communities in Kenya and have proven it is incredibly . useful to people. Children, teachers and village elders have all . embraced it,\u2019 she wrote on Kickstarter. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but also play an important electricity-generating role. It has been trialled in Kenya (pictured) and its creator hopes Spark will let children do homework when it is dark and charge phones to connect families and communities . A USB port on the side of the Spark allows people to charge a mobile phone or plug in a lamp, and during tests in Kenya, this proved to be safer than using a kerosene lamp. \u2018During testing, the people who used Spark said it was useful because they had light in the evenings which they used for doing homework, household chores and for lighting their way home in the dark,\u2019 Kheterpal continued. \u2018Spark will enable children and their families to be safer by eliminating the need of kerosene for light for example, and by providing light for women and girls in areas where rape is a huge problem.\u2019 The design is based on the shape of a heart, but it gets its geometric look because Kheterpal was also inspired by flint stones, which are used to create a spark and \u2018give birth to a powerful new source of energy.' So far, just over half of the money required to ship 1,000 Sparks to Kenya has been raised and people can buy t-shirts, tickets to a special Faithless concert as well as a Spark assembly kit, for \u00a3150, which will be manufactured next year."}]}

The issue was raised after Gareth Williams was told by nurses that patients on his mother's ward at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales were being given powerful sedatives without prescription. Mr Williams was told what was happening by a whistleblowing nurse before the death of his 82-year-old mother Lillian Williams. It has already been admitted in her case during\u00a0Protection of Vulnerable Adults investigation into her death. Mrs Williams, a mother-of-five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board. An investigation has been launched at the Princess of Wales Hospital into claims that nurses drugged elderly and vulnerable patients without prescription or consent in order to make sure they had an 'easy night shift' In the wake of her case, police have referred criminal charges against nurses at the hospital for\u00a0allegedly giving sedatives to vulnerable patients without prescription or consent. Mr Williams said: 'A nurse told me she had witnessed patients regularly being given unnecessary sedation without prescription at night to make life easier for the night shift team. 'I told nurses I had been promised by my mother's doctor she would not be sedated without consent or prescription. 'They said it is alright for them to promise the impossible and then walk off but we have to cope with them all night. 'A nurse told us many of the people being sedated are very ill and very frail and if you give them the wrong drug it could kill them.' The hospital is already at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect. Richard Baker, a barrister who represented families at the inquiry into appalling care and high death rates at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, said that using drugs without the consent of patients so staff could have a quiet night would be inappropriate. He said: 'The use of drugs inappropriately, in patients who could not offer consent would also be wrong. Administering medication to sedate patients so that staff could have a quiet night would be an inappropriate use of that medication. 'Both would be gross breaches of nursing and clinical standards and would likely lead to disciplinary action. 'As to seriousness, it would evidently have the potential to end the careers of the people involved.' The allegations came to light after a nurse told Gareth Williams his mother Lillian Williams, 82, was one of a number of patients being given powerful sedatives without consent or prescription at the hospital . Mr Williams said the nurse said she'd seen patients on his mother's ward given drugs without prescription . Welsh Assembly Member Bethan Jenkins has written to Ed Beltrami, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in Wales, to ask him to speed up the process of reviewing the evidence and to bring charges. She said police had been investigating since Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) admitted that Mrs Williams was 'sedated unnecessarily without consent'. Ms Jenkins, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales West, said a whistleblower nurse working for the health board had approached Mrs Williams' family and told them that 'for years she has witnessed night staff on Ward 6 sedating elderly vulnerable patients without prescription'. Ms Jenkins said the family had been involved in a 'protracted battle' to get an answer about what happened to their mother. She said:\u00a0'So naturally they are at a loss to understand why it has taken 16 months for the police to investigate and why there is not yet a decision from the CPS as to whether these admissions of very serious abuses and neglects amount to crimes. 'They believe - as do I - that 16 months is ample time to investigate and come to a decision. Bereaved families need closure, and the delays in this investigation are only putting off that day.' Helen Rundle, a lawyer leading calls for a public inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Welsh NHS, said a decision on charges by the CPS would be made in the next few weeks. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is investigating complaints regarding the quality of care provided to Lilian Williams whilst she was an in-patient at both The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot Hospital during 2010 and 2012 respectively. 'Whilst the CPS has been in contact with South Wales Police in relation to this aspect of the investigation, we have not been asked to provide formal charging advice. In mid-November, the CPS received a report from South Wales Police seeking observations on their findings and the content of that report is currently under consideration. 'We have recently received correspondence on this matter from elected Assembly Members and representatives of the victim's family. It would be therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further before we have responded directly to these enquiries.' A spokesman for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were cooperating with the ongoing police investigation, but said it would be inappropriate to comment until it was complete. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}]}

Chris Hines, former sustainability director of the Eden Project and a lifelong surfer and committed environmentalist came up with the idea for the board when a balsa tree had to be taken down in the rainforest biome. \"I said, well, let's make a completely sustainable surfboard, because I knew people who could laminate in hemp cloth and plant-based resin, so we went for it. It was a eureka moment: we thought, let's really have a go, let's really see what we can do,\" he told CNN. Hines and the Eden Project team soon realized that balsa and hemp cloth were too heavy for commercially viable surfboards, but desire remained to produce a surfboard that reduces the reliance on petroleum chemicals and uses more sustainable materials. The Eden team worked with local company Homeblown to create a new type of foam core for the eco-board, 15 to 20 percent of which is made from plant derived material. Another local Cornish company, Sustainable Composites, developed a resin made almost entirely from linseed oil instead of oil-derived coatings, meaning over 50 percent of the final finished surfboards are made from renewable materials. Completing the use of local companies, the boards are being manufactured by surfboard shapers, Laminations. Junior British surfing champion Tassy Swallow is set to compete at the International Surfing Association World Junior Championships in Ecuador on a new Eden surfboard. \"It's a really good board, it worked really well,\" said Swallow after her first outing on the board. \"It feels a lot more buoyant in the nose which makes it easier to catch waves. It will really catch on when people realize that it's as good as a regular board.\""}]}

There is a glimmer of hope for casino workers in Atlantic City, New Jersey, who risk losing their jobs when two - maybe three - of the city's most well-known casinos close their doors later this year - according to the city's mayor, at least one of those casinos has several potential buyers. However, workers at one of those casinos took to the streets Thursday to protest the planned August closing of the Showboat Casino. Chanting 'Keep Showboat open,' hundreds of casino workers and supporters staged a noisy, enthusiastic protest Thursday night on the Atlantic City Boardwalk aimed at getting the owners of the Showboat Casino Hotel to reverse their decision to close it next month. Showboat: Protesters gathered on the Atlantic City boardwalk to protest the planned closing of the Showboat Casino . Trend: Showboat is just one of three casinos that could close in the coming months . Economy: The Atlantic City economy relies almost exclusively on the casino industry, which has taken a serious hit in recent years . More than 400 protesters marched from a small park near the Boardwalk to Caesars Atlantic City, where a small group met with a labor attorney for the parent company that owns both casinos. The attorney promised to meet with union officials Aug. 7, but could not answer their immediate questions, said Donna DeCaprio, secretary-treasurer of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE casino union, which organized the protest. 'We\u2019re going to keep fighting this,' she said. The still-profitable Showboat is one of three Atlantic City casinos that could shut down by September. Trump Plaza plans a Sept. 16 closure, and Revel could also close if a buyer is not found in a bankruptcy auction next month. That could put 8,000 workers on the streets within a few weeks. Atlantic City started the year with 12 casinos, but could end the summer with eight. The Atlantic Club shut down in January. Trump: Dawn French, a cocktail server at Trump Plaza, speaks to protesters during Thursday's protest . 'It\u2019s a tragedy, what\u2019s happening here,' said Curtis Wade, a cook at the Showboat for 27 years. 'We\u2019re a profitable casino; there\u2019s no reason to shut us down.' Speaking to Caesars Entertainment, the casino\u2019s parent company that announced the Showboat closure to reduce competition in the saturated Atlantic City market, Wade said he felt betrayed. 'You said we were like a family, and if we worked hard, we would all prosper,' he said. 'Now you\u2019re turning your back on us. After 27 years, now you say you don\u2019t need me.' Wade and others said they believe other companies are interested in buying the Showboat; Caesars said recently it would consider selling it instead of closing it if a good offer materialized. 'Showboat is a good, viable property,' said Eve Davis, a cocktail server there. 'If Caesars doesn\u2019t want it, fine. Sell it. We just need someone to come in here and love it.' Caesars Entertainment issued a statement saying it has no new information on the status of the Showboat, adding it plans to meet with workers next month to share any updates by then. Iconic: Showboat is one of the most well-known casinos in Atlantic City since it opened in 1987 . Trumped: Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino is scheduled to close later this year as Atlantic City's economy continues to crumble . Buyers: Atlantic City's mayor says there currently are six potential buyers for the troubled Revel hotel and casino . The protesters chanted loudly, blew whistles and beat drums at the entrance of Caesars, where a half-dozen security guards milled about at the front entrance. Many protesters carried hand-made signs excoriating Caesars Entertainment; several included unflattering photos of company CEO Gary Loveman. One read: 'Mr. Loveman: Please let Me Keep My Job.' Others said: 'Atlantic City: Broken Promises.' Bob McDevitt, the union president, said he was pleased at the political and public support for keeping the Showboat open so far. 'I have no doubt that if they continue the pressure and community support that Caesars will have no choice but to do the right thing,' he said."}]}

While Premier League stars park their supercars outside multi-million-pound mansions, Stephanie Houghton earns just \u00a316,000 a year, shares a house with three girls and drives a Vauxhall Corsa. But the new sensation of women\u2019s football is too busy enjoying her sport to be envious of her cosseted male counterparts. \u2018The money doesn\u2019t bother me \u2013 I just want to play football,\u2019 the blonde 24-year-old told the Mail. Although she is a defender, Miss Houghton has scored in all three matches for Great Britain, helping the team to win their group. And today she will try to maintain her goal-a-game record when the team take on Canada in the quarter-finals at Coventry before a sell-out crowd. Miss Houghton became an instant celebrity after scoring the winner against Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday watched by a crowd of 70,000 \u2013 the biggest ever for a women\u2019s football match in England. Such an audience would have been unthinkable a month ago, when many mocked the decision to kick-start the Olympics with women\u2019s football and predicted half-empty stadiums. But Miss Houghton has helped to give the sport a prominence never seen before. Her followers on Twitter have soared from a couple of thousand to 20,556 in just a week and she has been declared the new poster girl for women\u2019s football. The former shop assistant from County Durham is, however, not about to let her success go to her head. \u2018I don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s happening at the moment,\u2019 she said. \u2018I am as surprised as anybody else, to be honest. The last week or so has just been amazing, absolutely unreal. \u2018If somebody had told me before the tournament that I would score three times I would have told them they were having a laugh. It is just what every footballer dreams of.\u2019 Miss Houghton grew up in the former mining village of South Hetton, close to where the dance film Billy Elliot was shot, with posters of Michael Owen and David Beckham on her wall. This week she met Beckham in person. Her mother Amanda, 47, a civil servant, told the Mail: \u2018She sent me a text saying, \u201cHe\u2019s perfect, Mum, he\u2019s absolutely perfect\u201d. \u2018I told her that no man is perfect and she just said, \u201cHe is, Mum. He\u2019s perfect\u201d.\u2019 Although she made Team GB \u2013 unlike Beckham \u2013 Miss Houghton can only dream of a lifestyle like his. Her \u00a316,000 salary comes from England while she receives only expenses from her current club, Arsenal. Where it all began: Houghton's year began in fantastic fashion at the Olympics at Wembley . Celebration time: Steph takes in the Wembley atmosphere after she helped Team GB beat Brazil . Her shared home is close to the club\u2019s training ground in London Colney, Hertfordshire. But if she is disappointed by her lifestyle, she doesn\u2019t show it. She told the Mail: \u2018It\u2019s not comparable to the men\u2019s game and it shouldn\u2019t be: this is a completely different game.\u2019 As a teenager, she watched Bend It Like Beckham \u2018over and over again\u2019, but her story also has more than a passing resemblance to 1981 film Gregory\u2019s Girl, in which a teenage girl plays for a boys\u2019 football team. Growing up: Aged eight, with four-year-old brother Stuart, and right, a star of the future at six months . She was given her first football at the age of three and, when she started primary school, became the only girl on the team. Her father Len, 47, an electrician, recalled how a boy\u2019s parents were furious when their son was left out of the team in favour of her. He said: \u2018They said she was the token girl and she shouldn\u2019t have been picked at all. They said, \u201cWhat\u2019s she playing for, this is a boys\u2019 game?\u201d \u2018Steph went on to score two goals in that match and someone said, \u201cThat\u2019s why she was playing\u201d.\u2019 Number one fans: With grandmother Doreen and brother Stuart last year . At the age of nine, during a summer coaching camp run by Sunderland FC, she was spotted by a talent scout and joined the academy. She made her debut for the women\u2019s team at 14 and moved on to Leeds United before signing for Arsenal in 2010. Her mother joked: \u2018We tried to convert her into a girl but we couldn\u2019t. She never had a doll or a pram. It was always just a football.\u2019 Mr Houghton said: \u2018The world is now her oyster. But she\u2019s very level-headed and her feet are well and truly on the ground. \u2018The Olympics will be over in a week for her and she\u2019ll just head back to Arsenal and carry on as normal.\u2019 Miss Houghton, who is single, said she had been inundated with messages from well-wishers. \u2018The support I\u2019ve had from family and friends has been unreal. My family always travel down and watch me play \u2013 and bring my grandma.\u2019"}]}

The former Wales international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a hotel in Rhyl, north Wales. Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition. Rapist footballer Ched Evans (pictured left and right) is considering quitting the game and becoming a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been reported . Now reports have emerged that he is considering ditching the game altogether and setting up his own business. He completed a decorating course while he was in jail and now wants to make use of his new skills, the Daily Star reports. Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. The newspaper quotes a source as saying: 'His earnings used to top \u00a320,000 a week at Sheffield United and now he is scrambling around looking for a club in the lower divisions. 'An outfit like Tranmere would pay about \u00a32,000 a week - and even they don't want him. 'He is thinking he might be better off giving up on football and building a business.' Evans was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players\u2019 union, the Professional Footballers Association. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. New life: The former professional's fiancee Natasha Massey has said 'all he wanted to do' was return to his career and Vicky Pryce says he had 'served his time' so should be able to start again . Outrage: Jessica Ennis-Hill (left) vowed to have her name removed from one of Sheffield United's stands and Charlie Webster (right) resigned her patronage over the issue . Following the backlash - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted its offer last week. Just days ago Tranmere Rovers chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old about the possibility of him playing for the League Two club, which is facing a relegation dog fight. Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned. Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. MailOnline has yet to receive a response after attempting to contact his representatives for a comment this morning."}]}

The French forward has been made to train with the reserves this summer and did not join Alan Pardew\u2019s squad on this month\u2019s tour of New Zealand. Ben Arfa fell out with the United management team towards the end of last season and is not part of their plans entering the new campaign. Au revoir: Hatem Ben Arfa agent says the player feels 'humiliated' by his exile at Newcastle . He was fined on his return to training last month for allegedly being 1.5kg overweight, although he will appeal against that sanction. Ben Arfa has one year to run on his current deal and, while he would prefer a return to France with Lyon, he could also run down the remainder of his contract in the reserves. The 27-year-old\u2019s representative, Michel Ouazine, said: \u2018We don\u2019t know what the problem is. Pardew in the past has said Hatem was extraordinary. Lonely: Ben Arfa has trained with Newcastle's reserves this summer after falling out with management . \u2018Hatem has done everything for Newcastle, every effort has been made to discuss the problem. We are in a situation where there doesn\u2019t seem to be a solution. \u2018He is simply doing his job: he trains well, he enjoys training with the reserves where he has a great coach in Peter Beardsley.\u2019 He went on: \u2018It\u2019s unfair and humiliating. We will challenge the fine. We asked Newcastle to give us the player\u2019s physical records. \u2018Hatem went on vacation with a personal trainer, he has worked to prepare for this season. That 1.5 kg? Yes, it is a pound of muscle and 500 grams of fat. \u2018He lost 2 per cent body fat. We therefore challenge the fine.\u2019 Ben Arfa could even play a waiting game and Ouazine says Pardew could well be gone before his player. \u2018Hatem doesn\u2019t have to leave,\u2019 he told SoFoot.com.

Who knows how long Pardew will be at Newcastle. In two months, he may not be here. Hatem love this club, he is idolised by fans. \u2018Hatem will remain professional and is working hard. He prefers a return to Lyon, but it is not economically feasible. Lyon is his first club, so there is a level of attachment.

Valerie Trierweiler boarded an Air France flight to Mumbai with an entourage that included her friend actress Charlotte Valandrey, BFMTV reported from the French capital's Charles de Gaulle Airport. Valandrey told BFMTV that Trierweiler \"was very happy to leave for that mission to save children in India. ... She is a strong woman with a heart ... someone who can be counted on and who is engaged in a humanitarian cause.\" While in India, her schedule will include attending a charity gala dinner, Action Against Hunger said on its website. It will be her first public appearance since a media storm over Hollande's alleged affair with an actress erupted this month. French president says it's over . Goodbye message . Hollande declared his relationship with Trierweiler over on Saturday. \"I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,\" Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. Speculation about the split swirled Saturday after a French national weekly reported Hollande was expected to announce his separation from Trierweiler later in the day. But the French presidency initially denied the report that an announcement would be made. \"It is a rumor that circulated on the Internet today. There is absolutely no confirmation of the publication of a statement today,\" the palace press officer told CNN. Hollande meets with Pope Francis amid scandal . U.S. trip planned for February .

Last weekend, Trierweiler left the hospital where she had spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match reported. The magazine also said she would recover for \"several days\" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande, 59, has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life. A recent survey by French pollster Ifop with the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than 80% of respondents had not changed their opinion of the President based on the allegations of an affair.

David Cameron suffered a humiliating reverse last night when more than half his MPs rejected his 11th-hour appeals for support for same-sex marriage. On an extraordinary day in the Commons, 134 Tory MPs took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans. Only 126 backed the legislation, with 35 abstaining. But with the help of the majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs Mr Cameron saw the measure passed easily, by a margin of 400 to 175. The first gay marriages are likely to be conducted within 12 months. The standard bearer of the Tory Right, Iain Duncan Smith, voted in favour of same-sex unions, but the Government\u2019s top lawyer, Dominic Grieve, astonished colleagues by abstaining. A source close to Mr Grieve said: \u2018He is a practising member of the Church of England and it has caused a lot of hurt and upset for the church.\u2019 Cabinet ministers who voted against the measure included Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said privately some years ago in a discussion about gay marriage that \u2018biddies don\u2019t like botties\u2019, and Welsh Secretary David Jones. They were joined by Simon Burns, Esther McVey and John Hayes. Mr Cameron has been accused of needlessly splitting his party and prioritising an issue important to only a handful of voters. One poll suggests 70 per cent of voters now see the Tories as divided. Despite the vote being deemed one of conscience, Tory MPs had been left in no doubt that the party leadership wanted as many as possible to vote in favour. Senior ministers including George Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May were wheeled out on the eve of the debate to make the case. Senior Tories had suggested before the vote it was crucial for Mr Cameron to win over more than half of his party \u2013 a benchmark he failed to meet. However, several Tories who rejected the measure said they objected to being described as \u2018rebels\u2019, since it was a free vote. Labour also suffered a split, with 22 of its MPs voting against. Scroll down for video . Passed: The Commons voted in favour of same-sex weddings by 400 votes to 175, a majority of 225 . Rebels: A total of 134 Tory MPs took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans. Only 126 backed the legislation, with 35 abstaining . A handful of Liberal Democrats \u2013 including former children\u2019s minister Sarah Teather \u2013 did likewise. The Prime Minister said: \u2018I am a strong believer in marriage. It helps people commit to each other and I think it is right that gay people should be able to get married too. \u2018This is, yes, about equality. But it is also about making our society stronger. I know there are strong views on both side of the argument \u2013 I accept that. But this is an important step forward for our country.\u2019 But Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, expressed doubts over the Government\u2019s assurances that faith groups will not be forced to conduct gay marriages. And Cheryl Gillan, the former Welsh secretary, said: \u2018This legislation was not in our manifesto, it was not in the coalition agreement and it was not in the Queen\u2019s speech.\u2019 Sir Roger Gale, Tory MP for North Thanet, accused Mr Cameron of an \u2018Orwellian\u2019 attempt to redefine marriage. He prompted uproar as he suggested the Government might as well allow civil unions between all people \u2018irrespective of their sexuality or their relationship ... that means brothers and brothers and sisters and sisters and brothers and sisters as well\u2019. Margot James, a leading modernising MP, accused the Church of England and anti-gay marriage campaigners of a \u2018deliberate\u2019 attempt to distort the debate by falsely claiming faith groups would be forced to conduct same-sex ceremonies. She warned the Conservatives risked alienating mainstream voters in the same way as US Republicans if they failed to embrace social changes such as equal marriage. The MP for Stourbridge, who is gay, told the Commons: \u2018My party should never flinch from the requirement that we must continue this progression, otherwise we may end up like the Republican party who lost an election last year that they could have won were it not for their socially conservative agenda.\u2019 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: \u2018We will look back on today as a landmark for equality in Britain.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u2018This is a proud day and an important step forward in the fight for equality in Britain.\u2019 Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage, which has opposed the legislation, said: \u2018This result is a disaster for David Cameron. Despite a personal plea from the PM his MPs have overwhelmingly rejected gay marriage. Mr Cameron must think again.\u2019 Last night was not the first time Mr Cameron has gone into the Commons division lobbies with a minority of his MPs over gay rights. In 2007, on a free vote, he was among fewer than half of his party who supported gay adoption. The previous biggest Tory split on a free vote was under Mr Duncan Smith in 2003, when the party split over reform of the House of Lords. Tony Blair suffered a bigger loss of support over foxhunting in 2004. Looking back: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the day would be seen as a 'landmark for equality in Britain' Culture Secretary Maria Miller defended the plans for gay marriage in the Commons . MARIA MILLER, TORY CULTURE SECRETARY . This Bill is about one thing. It is about fairness, it is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so while protecting the rights of those who don\u2019t agree with same-sex marriage. TIM LOUGHTON, TORY FORMER CHILDREN'S MINISTER . Who are we, this Government, or this country, to redefine the term marriage that has meant one man and one woman across cultures, across ages, across geographical barriers since before state and religion themselves? YVETTE COOPER, LABOUR'S EQUALITIES SPOKESMAN . \u2018Call us hopeless romantics, call it the triumph of hope over experience \u2013 most of us think when people love each other and want to make that long-term commitment, that is a wonderful thing. So why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay? JIM DOBBIN, LABOUR MP FOR HEYWOOD AND MIDDLETON . The Government cannot possibly guarantee protection for churches or individuals with a traditional view because it cannot predict or control what happens in the courts. SIR ROGER GALE, TORY MP FOR NORTH THANET . It is not possible to redefine marriage. Marriage is the union between a man and a woman, has been historically, remains so. It is Alice in Wonderland territory, Orwellian almost, for any Government of any political persuasion to seek to come along and try to re-write the lexicon. It will not do. EDWARD LEIGH, TORY MP FOR GAINSBOROUGH . We should be in the business of protecting cherished institutions and our cultural heritage otherwise what, I ask, is a Conservative Party for? Indeed we are alienating people who have voted for us for all their lives, leaving them with no one to vote for. NICK HERBERT, FORMER TORY POLICE MINISTERWhat are heterosexual couples going to say? \u2018Darling our marriage is over, Sir Elton John has just gotten married to David Furnish\u201d? Labour's equalities spokesman Yvette Cooper asked: 'Why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay?' STEPHEN TIMMS, LABOUR MP FOR EAST HAM Children are at the heart of marriage... but they are barely mentioned at the Bill. The Bill aims to open up the benefits of marriage to people excluded from it at the moment but it is doing at the price of taking away a significant part of its meaning.\u2019 PETER BONE, TORY MP FOR BILLERICAY It is my saddest day as an MP when my party brings in a Bill which I\u2019m fundamentally opposed to. I\u2019m very sad my party has brought this in without any democratic mandate. SIR GERALD HOWARTH, FORMER TORY DEFENCE MINISTER This Bill is wrong, the consultation process was a complete sham, it is opposed by the established church, it has caused deep and needless divisions within the Conservative Party, there is no mandate for it, there are huge potential consequences, not least the prospect of endless legal challenge and the nation faces much more serious challenges which the Government needs to address. EMMA REYNOLDS, LABOUR MP FOR WOLVERHAMPTON NORTH EAST The love that two men or two women feel for each other is equal to that felt by a heterosexual couple. Their love is no less significant and no less important. JOHN GLEN, TORY MP FOR SALISBURYBy a factor of at least 30 to one my constituents have expressed their opposition to this. Huge numbers of Conservative supporters feel grave disappointment and alienation at the decision to pursue this legislation. ANDREW SELOUS, TORY MP FOR SOUTH WEST BEDFORDSHIRE What of further redefinitions? Will this be the last redefinition of marriage? I understand in the Netherlands and Brazil three way relationships are being legally recognised.\u2019 GAVIN BARWELL, TORY MP FOR CROYDON CENTRAL For Conservatives to work, we have to accept that the world changes.

An attack by an armed gunman in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" was met with shock and grief throughout the country, and cast a shadow over what for fans was set to be a blockbuster weekend. Gunman kills 12 in Colorado movie theater . Experts said it's difficult to determine what, if any, effect the tragedy may have on either ticket sales or fan turnout in the days and weeks to come. \"For somebody to go into a movie theater, a place of fun and escapism, and bring that kind of violence into that world is shocking and tragic,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com. \"How this will affect the movie, I just don't know.\" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror . According to Exhibitor Relations, the film did brisk business for its midnight screenings, raking in $30.6 million. Many fans had pre-purchased tickets for screenings across the country. Dergarabedian said the current focus has been rightfully on those injured and killed because of the violence. Beyond that it is up to Warner Bros., the studio that released the film, to decide how to proceed with marketing in the wake of the tragedy, he said. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . Warner Bros., which is owned by the parent company of CNN, has been heavily marketing the action film that includes scenes featuring lots of gunplay and violence. A full-page newspaper ad heralding the opening weekend contains a pull quote from Marlow Stern, assistant culture editor of Newsweek, which says, \"A monumental conclusion to the epic trilogy. Audiences will be blown away.\" Warner Bros. pulled the trailer for the film \"Gangster Squad,\" which had been running before showings of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" That film trailer features scenes of men armed with machine guns attacking a movie theater. A representative for the company told CNN that Warner Bros. did not plan to cancel any screenings. Thelma Adams, contributing editor for Yahoo Movies, said the tragedy poses a conundrum for the studio. \"I know people at Warner Bros. who were called and woken up this morning who now have a huge problem on their hands,\" she said. \"I think in the long run, a lot of the money is made globally with a movie like this and that will not have an impact.\" Theater offers 'perfect killing' zone, expert says . Adams continued, \"Also it's not just an opening weekend movie. There (are) no other movies kind of in competition this weekend as a lot of other movies stepped off this weekend and next weekend. Yes, there will be some impact of the revenue stream, but it's not going to really hurt.\" Warner Bros. canceled the film's planned premiere in Paris on Friday and released the following statement: \"Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.\" An official with Paris police told CNN there was a police presence outside the Bristol Hotel, where cast members of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" were staying before the premiere, to \"protect all those who could be threatened.\" Actor Gary Oldman, who portrays Commissioner Jim Gordon in the film, said in a statement, \"My prayers and deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families of this horrific act.\" Scott Beggs, managing editor of the website Film School Rejects, said the film franchise has been popular because \"at the heart of (the film) is a central heroic figure that gives hope to people.\" In Aurora, the agonized seek answers . Beggs pointed out that the death of actor Heath Ledger from a toxic combination of prescription drugs in 2008 cast a bit of a pall over \"The Dark Knight,\" but did not taint the legacy of what went on to become a critically acclaimed film. Ledger was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role as The Joker in that movie. \"(That second film) was touched by tragedy, but I believe the art ended up speaking for itself,\" Beggs said. \"(The shootings in Colorado) were a tragic event that took place, which hopefully will not stop us from living our lives.\" Are you there?

Veteran Dolphins players have been accused of forcing newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles including $30,000 dinners and trips to Las Vegas. According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is behind Jonathon Martin's shock leave of absence from the team last week. ESPN claims lineman Richie Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter. Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims . Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke. Reporter Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around $400.000.' Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation. 'Everything tastes better when . rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I . just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight' The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.' They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being. 'The Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the statement read. 'As an organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.' After ESPN reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind 'sources' who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.' Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, had taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . Three minutes later, the player . added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my . name through the mud with with lies.' It was first reported on Friday that tackle Jonathan Martin had taken a personal leave of absence from the team because of persistent bullying and teasing at the hands of certain teammates. Martin, . nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by . bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice. The . latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters on Monday . after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them . for lunch. The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out, reports FOX Sports. Martin is receiving professional assistance for emotional issues. A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that Martin is with relatives and doesn't have any problems with the coaching staff. Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University . The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University. He played in last Sunday's loss at New England, then missed practice during the week. He was replaced by Tyson Clabo in Thursday night's game against Cincinnati. A second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of the Dolphins' struggling offensive line. 'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time. 'You can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to help the team win.' Pass protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) were saddled with a four-game losing streak. Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise. The NFL Players Association is monitoring the situation and has made inquiries into determining what has happened with Martin, a source told FOX Sports. Martin, posted a message on Facebook that read, in part, 'Happy Halloween! Don't believe everything you read.' The message also reportedly added, 'Opinions are like (expletive), everyone has one.'"}]}

The report in a Punjabi newspaper does not mince words. It talks of a \u2018crazed\u2019 Englishwoman arousing concerns for her safety in the Sikh holy city of Anandpur Sahib in India. It claims that in the confines of a Sikh temple, she has been seen bathing in sacred pools \u2018without clothes\u2019 \u2014 which, if true, is an outrageous act in such a conservative, deeply spiritual society \u2014 and keeping her underwear near the holy book, akin to sacrilege. Lately, it states, she has been seen wandering around in the streets, bazaars and temples alone, like a \u2018crazed person\u2019, and has become the talk of the town. Baba Gurdev Singh Ji, chief executor of the Shaheedi Bagh Sikh temple, is quoted asking for the UK High Commission to take her back and hand her over to her family. \u2018If someone misbehaves with this foreign woman,\u2019 he is reported saying, \u2018then India will gain a bad reputation.\u2019 The article \u2014 which claims the woman was left by her husband \u2014 suggests that some locals are worried she could be a British government spy, so bizarre is her behaviour. So who is this woman, the source of such worrying gossip? None other than former socialite Alexandra Aitken, daughter of disgraced former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken and Sikh convert who now goes by the name of Uttrang Kaur Khalsa. The unsubstantiated report, published in November, couldn\u2019t be in starker contrast to the glossy 2010 Hello! magazine spread celebrating the marriage of the former \u2018It-girl\u2019, now 34, and Inderjot Singh, a Sikh \u2018warrior\u2019 from the Punjab. It was an unlikely union from the start \u2014 Alexandra\u2019s life once centred on Mayfair parties, posh boys and polo \u2014 and rumours it was in trouble have been rife for months. Last weekend, Alexandra\u2019s father finally confirmed it was over and that the couple, who met at a yoga retreat in the Punjabi holy city of Amritsar, were now \u2018detached\u2019 \u2014 if, indeed, they were ever legally married. Although they affirmed their commitment to each other in a ceremony in Amritsar attended by 150 holy men and 300 guests, there is doubt that the marriage was ever officially registered. According to a report in the Tribune newspaper last September, the union came under strain when Alexandra did not appear before a magistrate to register the marriage and didn\u2019t attend the funeral of Inderjot\u2019s father. This week, approached by the Mail as she attended a Sikh festival, Alexandra politely declined to comment on her marriage or the report of naked bathing in holy pools (Sikh women usually go in fully clothed). \u2018I am really happy that you approached to speak with me, but I do not wish to speak to anyone. Have a nice day,\u2019 she said, before disappearing into the crowd. While the marriage may be over, Alexandra\u2019s passion for her adopted religion remains undimmed. It is thought to be why she remains in Anandpur Sahib, even if her presence appears to cause consternation to other residents of the sleepy \u2018Holy City of Bliss\u2019. Here, she is one of the few, if not the only, unattached Western woman in the 16,000 population \u2014 such a rarity that police apparently turned up at her lodgings recently to ask why she was there and check all was well. According to a police officer, she was asked to fill out a foreigner\u2019s registration form \u2014 to ensure the safety of foreign nationals \u2014 on which she listed her status as \u2018unmarried\u2019 and named her father as an emergency contact. She then asked to be left alone. Home for the privately educated art school graduate for the past few months has been a \u00a312-a-night room in a guest house, with nothing more than a bed, toilet and TV. Transformation: Alexandra at a London film premiere in 2003 (left) and with Inderjot after their 'marriage' Described by staff as \u2018kind-hearted\u2019, she is so environmentally conscious that she asks them \u2018not to waste water and electricity\u2019. \u2018Madam doesn\u2019t talk much,\u2019 said one. \u2018She keeps to herself most of the time, but she would get really angry if someone left the lights on during the day. She would make sure the taps in her room never dripped water.\u2019 According to locals, Alexandra first stayed in Anandpur Sahib last year with her husband, a member of a Sikh order called the Nihang. When she returned six months ago, however, she was alone. For a month she stayed in a dera, or Sikh seminary, before moving into lodgings. Inderdeep Singh, a caretaker at the Keshgarh Sikh temple attended by Alexandra, told us: \u2018I was told that her husband was a Nihang and that they had a break-up. \u2018So when she came here, I could see she was heartbroken. In this house of God, she found peace. Since then she comes to prayers at the gurdwara (temple) regularly.\u2019 Jonathan Aitken, 72, told the Mail: \u2018My daughter is still a very devoted Sikh and I am personally still on good terms with Inderjot. Miss Aitken's father told the Mail she remains a devoted Sikh despite separating from her Indian 'husband' \u2018They remain friends, but the marriage is not working in any sense that we would understand, and there is considerable doubt whether it was a lawful marriage ceremony \u2014 or so I am told.\u2019 Dismissing reports of her \u2018crazed\u2019 behaviour as \u2018nonsense\u2019, he said: \u2018She likes to maintain her privacy. She doesn\u2019t have a mobile and it\u2019s hard to get hold of her. She tries to stay clear of the world. \u2018I\u2019m absolutely confident that she is safe and knows what she is doing. She has lodgings which my ex-wife and I pay the rent for. \u2018She was here in Britain until October and has been visited by several people since who have all said that she is safe and happy.\u2019 H e later confirmed: \u2018They were not married and are now detached. It was more a colourful, folklore ceremony than a proper one. I think both sides know the marriage is over, if it ever was a marriage.\u2019 Certainly Alexandra\u2019s faith appears to be deeply held. Last month, she posted a new profile picture on Facebook showing herself wearing a Sikh turban. Completely divorced from her old life of London parties \u2014 dwarves dressed in Dennis the Menace outfits once served up toffee vodkas for guests at her 22nd birthday bash \u2014 Alexandra is devoted to spreading Sikh principles and extols the Punjabi way of living on two websites. The former actress, who once posed naked for GQ magazine, now writes about the benefits of wearing a chunni (long scarf) made of cotton rather than silk because it is \u2018cooling and calming for the mind\u2019. Mr Aitken added he remained on good terms with his daughter's former partner . Devoted to charitable work and helping the poor, she has a vision of building schools, hospitals and meditation centres. In 2013, her father revealed that when she returned to Britain to visit she refused to sleep in a bedroom, instead camping in the garden of her aunt, actress Maria Aitken, so she could lie on the earth. \u2018It\u2019s all part of being close to the soil,\u2019 said Mr Aitken. \u2018I find it very hard to get my head around all this, but I love her dearly.\u2019 Formerly effusive about her \u2018noble\u2019 husband and their shared spirituality, Alexandra has kept quiet since their \u2018rough patch\u2019 became public knowledge. \u2018Many believe, don\u2019t talk unless it improves on silence,\u2019 is all she would say. Asked about her marriage at a Sikh conference in London in 2013, she became defensive and finally replied: \u2018God is my true love.\u2019 Perhaps the only clue to what went wrong can be found in a cryptic message posted on the Nihangi website for which she occasionally writes. Under the heading \u2018A Biography \u2014 Uttrang Kaur Khalsa\u2019 are the simple words: A Lover. The Wife. The Student. The Hopeful Listener. Forgive me. Sat Siri Akal (God is the Ultimate Truth). A family friend said that Alexandra had been wrestling with the fact that, apart from their faith, she and Inderjot had very little in common: she saw herself as a free spirit, in touch with Nature, while he was more traditional and felt that her place was at home with him. \u2018There\u2019s a feeling among her friends and family that she rushed into marriage,\u2019 says the friend. Alexandra and Inderjot met in 2009 and it was her love of Kundalini yoga, which is associated with Sikhism, that first drew her to the religion. By then her privileged upbringing had been shattered after her father was jailed for 18 months in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice. She had also discovered that her friend Petrina Khashoggi was, in fact, her half-sister \u2014 the result of an affair between Jonathan and Soraya Khashoggi. \u2018She couldn\u2019t be more different from the girl who used to walk down Sloane Street,\u2019 said one old friend. \u2018She looks unkempt, she doesn\u2019t cut her hair and when she was here she was telling everyone what they should and shouldn\u2019t eat.\u2019 Yet, despite the end of her short-lived marriage, is she happy? Her father certainly believes so. And so does Alexandra."}]}

Domestic: Diane DeMaio is in critical condition after he husband Michael allegedly beat her with a baseball bat . Her husband Michael, 55, was arrested when police arrived at the couple's Connecticut mansion and spoke to the victim's mother, Gloria Sica, who said: 'That monster hit her and she's dying'.

Italy's new government vowed to make protecting women from violence a priority on the same day as the funeral of a 16-year-old girl allegedly killed by her boyfriend took place. MPs in the country's chamber of deputies unanimously voted to pass the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women as Fabiana Luzzi, whose death caused national outrage, was mourned by residents of Corigliano Calbro in southern Italy. The teenager was allegedly stabbed to death by her 17-year-old boyfriend last week then doused in petrol and set alight while she is thought to have still been alive. Victim: Fabiana Luzzi was allegedly stabbed to death by her boyfriend in Italy last week. Her death added urgency to a parliamentary vote which saw Italian MPs prioritise action against gender-based violence . The schoolgirl's death gave the parliamentary vote an increased urgency and followed a lengthy MPs debate, according to The Guardian. Equal opportunities minister Josefa Idem said that the convention is a positive step in trying to curb violence against women. According to The Guardian, she said on a visit to Corigliano: 'Faced with Fabiana's death, I reaffirm the commitment of all the government and my ministry to make the fight against gender-based violence a key point of this legislature. 'I feel the need to ask forgiveness from her and all the women killed by the hand of those who abuse the word love. Poignant: Mourners gathered to remember murdered Fabiana Luzzi in Italy on the same day that politicians debated violence against women . 'The state must be more effective in this commitment (and) be even closer to the victims.' Widespread problem: According to figures released in 2011, as many as one in three women in Italy are subjected to domestic violence . Women's campaign group Casa della Donne claims that at least 51 women have been murdered in Italy so far this year, but with no official statistics, they believe the figure could actually be three times that. The group praised the Italian government for ratifying the convention - known as the Istanbul Convention - but added that it must ensure that its measures are thoroughly followed through. According to statistics from Istat published in 2011, around one in three Italian women are victims of domestic violence. The UN urged the country to tackle the problem after a visit from a special rapporteur last year. As well as Fabiana's murder last week, a 50-year-old woman, Silvana Cassol, was shot by her husband, who then shot himself, in Padua, and a 35-year-old Romanian woman, Angelica Timis, was allegedly stabbed and killed by her former partner near Milan. Although 25 countries, including Britain, have signed the Istanbul Convention, the convention needs the ratification of ten including eight Council of Europe member states. But so far Italy is just the fifth to pass it through its parliament. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}]}

We want to play football.\" Without a last-minute agreement or the extension of the deadline, the NFL Players Association had been expected to decertify on Thursday afternoon -- meaning it would stop being the collective bargaining agent for the players. By decertifying, the union would clear the way for the players to file an antitrust lawsuit if the owners lock out the players as soon as Friday, after the current contract expires. All of that would mean the first NFL work stoppage since 1987 and the likelihood of months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone. Even if there is a lockout, the NFL draft would proceed as scheduled on April 28-30, the league says. All other regular off-season activity would cease, threatening to delay or cancel the start of the 2011 season now scheduled for September 8. Asked about the talks, President Obama said Thursday that the parties ought to be able to figure out how to split the revenue and keep fans happy. \"You've got owners, most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars, you've got players who are making millions of dollars,\" he said during a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. \"My working assumption, at a time when people are having to cut back, compromise and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids' college education is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the president of the United States intervening.\" Currently, the owners take about $1 billion off the top of league revenue, and the players get 60 percent of the rest. For a new contract, the owners want to double their take off the top to $2 billion, with the players continuing to get 60 percent of the rest. The NFL generated $9.3 billion in revenue in 2010. Other issues include a proposal by the owners to increase the regular season schedule to 18 games from the current 16. The overall number of games per season, including exhibition games, would remain at the current 20. The players' union questions why the owners should get additional money up front and challenges the league's 32 teams to fully open their financial records. The owners, who say they are not legally obligated to provide full financial disclosure, argue they are looking out for the long-term stability of the franchises and the league. If there is a lockout, players won't get their salaries or bonuses, and if the shutdown forces the league to cancel games next season, the NFL estimates a loss of $400 million in revenue each week. Another possible scenario from the talks would have Cohen declare an impasse that would automatically extend the rules of the expiring collective bargaining agreement. Such an impasse can only occur if neither side takes steps to halt the negotiations, such as the union decertifying or the owners declaring a lockout."}]}

The object was later identified as being either a speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun.

In 1948, the US government launched several inquiries into UFO sightings, which many believed were sparked by Cold War paranoia. In what became known as 'Project Blue Book,' more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs were looked into by the Air Force.

The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' \u2013 or around 5.5 per cent of the files. The files, which can be accessed here, were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington. Professor Andrew Balogh from the Imperial College London Department of Physics tells MailOnline: 'Generally speaking UFO sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence. 'It's difficult to judge from the video in this instance, because of its poor quality. If Nasa has access to high quality images, they may investigate further.' Nasa is yet to comment the incidents. The space agency's ISS live stream and rover photos have become a huge source of 'evidence' for conspiracy theorists. Many scientists believe UFO sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing significant objects in random places. 'The vast majority of these images are as vague and elusive as those posted by UFO witnesses on Earth, and many have a fairly mundane explanation, 'Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told MailOnline. 'The problem is that the more Nasa denies such things or explains them the more people\u00a0think there is a conspiracy to hide the truth that aliens are visiting our planet.' On October 7, UFO watchers said they witnessed a strange object near the station during a spacewalk by astronauts Reid Wiserman and Alexander Gerst ."}]}

A Pennsylvania man who shot dead a couple who invaded his home and killed his wife and son, only learned when being questioned by police that the woman he killed in self-defense was his estranged daughter . Josephine and Jeff Ruckinger, both 43, shot and killed her mother, 64-year-old Roberta Frew, and brother, 47-year-old John Frew Jr, before being shot and killed themselves by her father John Frew late last Friday. According to police, the Ruckingers knocked on her family's door at about 10pm after the family returned from dinner and was settling to watch TV. Unrecognizable: A man in Pennsylvania unknowingly shot and killed his estranged daughter when she and her husband invaded his home - killing his wife and son . Her mother answered the door and quickly yelled 'Oh my God, they have guns' before she was shot by her daughter wielding a sawed-off shot gun. The couple proceeded into the house and continued to shoot her older brother. When she turned her gun to her father it was too late. He had retrieved a .22-caliber pistol after hearing the commotion and shot her in the head. When her husband tried to retaliate, he shot him as well. By the time police arrived, Mrs Frew, John Frew Jr and Jeff Ruckinger were already dead. Josephine was still alive with a gunshot wound to the head, but died later at the hospital. It was only when Mr Frew was being questioned by police that he was informed that it was his daughter Josephine that he killed. He hadn't recognized her. The two had been estranged for years, and a family member says Josephine nursed a grudge for her family. Josephine had 'a hatred toward the family' according to her aunt Virginia Cruse, who spoke with the Lewistown Sentinel. Cruse said the daughter and mother did not get along, but that she had no idea what spawned Friday's tragedy. When Josephine was about 20, she and a boyfriend trashed her parents' home and stole items including a pistol, then fled to Pittsburgh, Cruse said. After that, she said, 'more or less, they disowned her. Jeff Ruckinger worked for a tire repair company and Josephine had disabilities that prevented her from working, Cruse said."}]}

Belonging to a tiny shrimp, the sperm, when uncoiled, was longer than the crustacean's entire body. The preserved semen were discovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia, and are the oldest ever found. World's oldest: The world's oldest fossilised sperm has been discovered coiled up inside a tint shrimp. This image is a cross-section of 17 million year old fossil ostracod sperm. The nuclei in each sperm (dark spot) are indicated by arrows . The giant sperm are thought to have been longer than the length of the creature\u2019s body but are tightly coiled up inside the sexual organs of the fossilised freshwater crustaceans, which are known as ostracods. \u2018These are the oldest fossilised sperm ever found in the geological record,\u2019 said Professor Mike Archer, of the University of New South Wales\u2019 School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences. He has been excavating at Riversleigh for more than 35 years. \u2018The Riversleigh fossil deposits in remote north-western Queensland have been the site of the discovery of many extraordinary prehistoric Australian animals, such as giant, toothed platypuses and flesh-eating kangaroos. So we have become used to delightfully unexpected surprises in what turns up there. An artist's impression of the site 17 million years ago. The cave was in the middle of a rainforest in an area that is now part of the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia. Tiny ostracods lived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats . \u2018But the discovery of fossil sperm, complete with sperm nuclei, was totally unexpected. It now makes us wonder what other types of extraordinary preservation await discovery in these deposits.\u2019 A research team from the university collected the fossil ostracods from the Bitesantennary Site at Riversleigh in 1988. They were sent to John Neil, a specialist ostracod researcher at La Trobe University in Melbourne who realised they contained fossilised soft tissues. Experts including Dr Renate Matzke-Karasz from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who authored the study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, examined the specimens at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The microscopic study revealed the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. This is a sketch of a male ostracod, showing the organisation and orientation of the reproductive system . The creature's zenker organs - muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female - were preserved. 'C' shows a scanning electron microscopic image of Riversleigh fossil ostracod on its left side, 'd' shows one of the creature's zenker organs and 'e' shows details of the zenker organ, including its chitinous rings marked as (cr) The microscopic study revealed that the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. Within these are the almost perfectly preserved giant sperm cells and within them, the nuclei that once contained the animals' chromosomes and DNA. The creature\u2019s zenker organs \u2013 muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female \u2013 were also preserved. The researchers estimate that the fossilised sperm are about 1.3 millimetres long, which is about the same length or slightly longer than the ostracod itself. \u2018About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,\u2019 Professor Archer explained. 'About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,' Professor Archer explained. The site of the fossil cave is pictured . Professor Suzanne Hand, a specialist in extinct bats and their ecological role in Riversleigh's ancient environments at the university, believes that the bats could have played a role in the preservation of the ostracod sperm cells. The steady rain of faeces from thousands of bats in the cave would have led to high levels of phosphorous in the water, which could have aided mineralisation of the soft tissues. \u2018This amazing discovery at Riversleigh is echoed by a few examples of soft-tissue preservation in fossil bat-rich deposits in France. So the key to eternal preservation of soft tissues may indeed be some magic ingredient in bat droppings,\u2019 Professor Hand said. Riversleigh has previously revealed insects with internal muscles that have been preserved because bacteria became fossilised as they attempted to consume the soft tissues of the creatures. Perfectly preserved cells of leaves have been found, as well as the preserved soft tissue of eyeballs in the eye sockets of some of the extinct marsupials.

A Michigan mother of two young boys who said she was battling cancer just a few years after a man was convicted of her rape, has been exposed as a total fraud. Sara Ylen, 38, has been charged with fraud, false pretenses and . using a computer to commit a crime after state police found no doctor . who diagnosed the cancer. The charges come as a local man, James Grissom, who spent nearly 10 years in . prison for her rape was released last year, after newly discovered . evidence cast doubt on whether she'd ever been attacked. Fraudster: Sara Ylen (left), 38 has been charged with fraud after appealing for money to fight her cancer after she also claimed she was raped, for which James Grissom (right) served almost 10 years in prison for . Ylen's community, which had come to . admire her as the subject of a newspaper's award-winning 2003 series . about surviving a rape, rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public. Churches sold Super Bowl sub sandwiches and auction items to raise . money. Friends cut her grass, bathed her at her modest home and provided . hot meals. An insurance company paid nearly $100,000 for hospice care. One of her close friends, Carol Connell, spoke of the gift she gave Ylen, in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need. 'It was a little box, a very ornate box, to hold a prayer. She needed God to look over her,' Connell said, recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave Ylen the jewelry. 'Sara was visibly touched.' Connell now can't help but wonder whether Ylen was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw-dropping deceit. 'The fact that she's lived this long is a miracle. But maybe it wasn't a miracle after all. ... I'm just baffled. Is she the biggest con artist in the state of Michigan or the victim?' Connell said. The fraud case isn't Ylen's only concern. In a neighboring county, she is charged with making a false report of rape just last year, even using makeup to create bruises. Ylen (pronounced WHY'-len) and her attorney, Dave Heyboer, have not returned phone messages seeking comment. Elaborate stories: In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a store parking lot more than a year earlier - there was no evidence but a man was convicted . The Associated Press went to a Lexington address listed in court documents, but she no longer lives there. The two cases against Ylen come years after she first emerged in the public eye in the Port Huron area, 60 miles northeast of Detroit. In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a Meijer store parking lot more than a year earlier. There was no surveillance video, physical evidence or witnesses. James Grissom, an off-duty Meijer employee with a past sex-related conviction, was charged after Ylen said her attacker, like Grissom, had a skull tattoo. He was found guilty in 2003 and sentenced to at least 15 years in prison, an enhanced punishment because Ylen said her attacker gave her a sexually transmitted disease. Next, Ylen told her story to the Port Huron Times Herald. She said she wanted people to see her as a 'victor', not a 'victim'. Readers inspired by 'Sara's Story', as the series was titled, started a fund to send her to community college. But it didn't take long for Ylen's story to start unraveling. Authorities learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her parents in Bakersfield, California, just months after the alleged parking lot attack back in Michigan. No charges were filed. 'My daughter likes to have a lot of attention,' her father, Dale Hill, told Bakersfield officers in a 2001 police report that wasn't uncovered until after Grissom's trial. Hill told the AP this week that he hasn't spoken to his daughter in years and didn't know anything about her recent claims. After years of appeals, a judge in 2012 ruled that the police report could have changed the outcome of Grissom's trial and ordered a new one, saying Ylen appeared to have 'concocted incredible stories' in California. Prosecutors dropped the case without a second trial, and Grissom was freed in November. As Grissom's appeals were moving through the courts, Ylen was telling people she had developed cancer from a disease transmitted during the assault. She was back in the newspaper, supported by friends, including a state police sergeant, who believed she was on the verge of death in 2009. 'Job of the Old Testament had nothing on Sara Ylen,' wrote Times Herald columnist Mike Connell, who is married to Carol Connell, referring to a pious man who repeatedly suffered misfortune. Just about a year ago, Ylen was in a wheelchair at a Croswell Wesleyan Church auction and spaghetti dinner that raised $10,800. 'I thought I was doing something good for someone who had cancer. It's like a bad Lifetime movie,' said event organizer Sue Birtles. 'I've heard that some people want their money back. ... I'm working on forgiveness.' Mercy Hospice, which visited Ylen at her home, declined to comment on her care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically 'must be certified' by a patient's doctor before services are provided. Ylen's ex-husband, Jim, declined to comment on the criminal charges against his former wife, but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her tales of woe. The couple were married in 1993, separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011. The marriage 'broke down due to the wife's complex lies and deceit involving fictitious rapes, kidnappings, pregnancies and illnesses \u2013 all attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms,' Jim Ylen's attorney, Aaron Cassell, said in a court filing. Sara Ylen told her husband the name of her cancer doctor, but he later learned there was no physician by that name in Michigan, Cassell said. And she wouldn't let him join her at medical appointments, even after driving hundreds of miles to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, Ill. The clinic says Sara Ylen never was a patient there, according to records reviewed by the AP. Psychologist Daniel Kachman evaluated Ylen as part of the divorce case and told the judge: 'Often feeling dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff, she may either withdraw from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of martyr.' Mike Connell, the newspaper columnist, said he regrets not treating his own doubts more seriously. 'Sara is innocent until proven guilty, but if she did pull off an elaborate con, consider what genius it required,' he said in an email. 'She has a brilliant mind. I recognized that straightaway.'"}]}

Festival fever is well and truly upon us, and although I missed out on Glastonbury as I'm filming in the Big Apple, I'll definitely be digging out the Hunters on my return as there are some awesome smaller UK events coming up I simply can't miss. Last year top celebrity makeup artist Daniel Sandler created a gorgeous boho-style floral festival look for me, which you can check out here. This year I've enlisted Daniel's help once more, but this time we've gone for something altogether different \u2013 a Gwen Stefani-esque party look that blends Nineties grunge-glam and futuristic cool. Here's how we did it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky was inspired by Gwen Stefani for this year's festival look . GET THE LOOK . Step 1 - Ace of Base . At a festival, you need make-up that will make your skin look fresh and radiant as well as last all day. Daniel recommended the Clarins BB Cream \u2013 the coverage is enough to conceal any pesky blemishes while still allowing your skin to breathe. It's easy to apply too \u2013 simply blend into the face with your fingertips, making sure to take the product down the neck to avoid tidemarks. Step 2 - Paint It Black . A black kohl pencil (waterproof, of course!) is a foolproof festival essential \u2013 whatever the look you're going for. So next, Daniel lined my eyes generously with his Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. 'Festival make-up needs to have a little bit of edge,' he explained, 'so to give the eyes a bit more attitude I smudged the liner out slightly with my Lip Brush for a slept-in effect that screams rock'n'roll.' Binky enlisted the help of make-up artist, Daniel Sandler for her bold and bright beauty look . Step 3 - Glitter Bug . Daniel then loaded some of the Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Pink Fire onto a smudger brush and gently dabbed it over my eyelids. The contrast of the shimmering lilac hue and the black eyeliner provides the perfect blend of girly and edgy. He also applied some to the tops of my cheekbones for a super-cool holographic effect and across my lips to create the illusion of a fuller pout. The mantra 'less is more' certainly doesn't apply to festival make-up \u2013 so feel free to go as wild as you like. A little does go a long way with this pigment, though! Step 4 - Fuschia Flutter . Instead of using a boring black mascara, Daniel decided to mix things up a bit and go for a vivid fuschia shade - in the form of Dior's Addict-It Lash Mascara \u2013 to really make the lashes pop. Daniel says that festival make-up has to have a bit more edge and attitude than a day-to-day look . A statement look like this calls for suitably bold brows, so Daniel defined and darkened mine using his Brown Velvet waterproof eye pencil, sweeping the colour through my brows with a small brush for added volume. Step 5 - After Glow . To give my skin a rosy-radiant glow, Daniel swept his Daniel Sandler Radiant Sheen Illuminating Face Powder across the apples of my cheeks. This pretty palette offers the perfect blend of golden and peachy tones to instantly perk up even the most hungover of complexions - plus the dark shade doubles up as a great contour colour. Finally, Daniel painted my pout with Guerlain Rouge G Lipstick in Gemma \u2013 a bold lilac shade providing a matte but moisturising wash of colour. Binky opted for a bright fuchsia shade of mascara to make her eyes really pop . So there you have it; a rave-ready festival look that will certainly make sure you stand out from the crowd - thanks Daniel! I also thought I'd share with you my top five festival essentials in case any of you are off to a festival soon and are a bit stuck on what to pack in the beauty department. You can get everything I've mentioned from Escentual.com. Binky gives you her top five festival beauty essentials . Klorane Oatmilk Gentle Dry Shampoo Spray \u2013 the ultimate festival hair saviour . Bioderma Photoderm Bronz Invisible Sun Mist SPF 50 \u2013 sunburn at a festival is no fun!

Yet the thousands of veterans who sailed on Arctic convoys to support the Russian war effort have been told they cannot collect bravery medals. Some 3,000 servicemen have been offered Ushakov medals by the Russian government to recognise their courage in taking part in Arctic missions to support fighting on the eastern front during the Second World War. Harrowing conditions: Thousands of sailors risked their lives in Arctic conditions to support the Russian war effort during the Second World war . Appalling cold: Snow and ice covered the upper works of all ships. Some 3,000 servicemen were awarded bravery medals for taking part in the daring campaign . But they have been told by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that accepting the medals would break rules in this country. Among those who were involved in the daring campaign was Lieutenant Commander Roy Francis, 90, from Forncett St Mary, Norfolk, who served on the cruiser HMS Edinburgh when it travelled to Murmansk in 1942 as the flagship for the convoys. On the return journey the cruiser, carrying four tonnes of gold bullion as payment from Stalin, was attacked over successive days by waves of enemy aircraft, submarines and destroyers. The ship was hit by two torpedoes and, despite fighting on for three days, was eventually sunk by a third. Crippled: HMS Edinburgh was sunk carrying four tonnes of gold bullion. It was attacked over successive days by waves of enemy aircraft, submarines and destroyers . Courageous: Lieutenant Commander Roy Francis was on board HMS Edinburgh when it was attacked. He was told he could not accept the Russian offer because he had already been honoured with the Atlantic Star . Damaged: Pictured is HMS Edinburgh after a torpedo hit it. Two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships . The ship (stern pictured) fought on for three days after it was hit by two torpedoes before it was eventually sunk by a third . Two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships. Lt Cdr Francis said: \u2018Arctic convoys were renowned to be the toughest voyages. In addition to the threats from U-boats, bombers and surface craft to all convoys, the main enemy was the bitter cold. \u2018I've known of ships where the build-up of ice led to the whole thing capsizing and the ship disappearing with all hands. Pictured is the Russian Medal of Ushakov, awarded for bravery . \u2018We had to keep chipping away at the ice, were constantly wet and it was normally too cold to sleep when off watch.\u2019 The FCO told veterans that because they have already been honoured with the Atlantic Star campaign medal, they could not accept the Russian offer. They were also told that their service had to have taken place in the last five years for them to be eligible. It has recently announced the creation of a specific Arctic campaign medal to recognise the severe hardships of this part of naval history. Lt Cdr Francis said: \u2018I'm pleased to see that this government has finally agreed to give us a British campaign medal. \u2018I'm told that checking eligibility for the award may take months, though, so I'm hoping I'll still be around when all of the bureaucracy has been carried out. None of us are getting any younger. \u2018I think they have got it wrong, though. The Russian government wants to give us a bravery medal, not a campaign medal. There is a big difference. \u2018Why can't our Government bend the rules when the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American governments have all allowed their veterans to accept this great honour? \u2018I think the Government should do what is right by the thousands of us who endured for freedom all those years ago, many of whom never made it.\u2019 A spokesman for the FCO said the department appreciated the Russian government's wish to recognise the \u2018brave and valuable\u2019 service given by veterans of the Arctic convoys. He said: \u2018The rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years. Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . Hero: In perilous conditions a sailor frees chains, wires and bollards from the ice . \u2018Additionally, permission cannot be granted if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services. \u2018We look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or Commonwealth state award upon a British citizen on an individual case-by-case basis.\u2019 A lapel badge - the Arctic Emblem - was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued. Last year, the Prime Minister asked Sir John Holmes to review the current policy on military medals, the FCO added. An e-petition asking the Government to reconsider has been set up on Downing Street's website."}]}

But experts say it is not working . Germany is battling a baby drought that has caused its population to plummet, leaving a rash of vacant homes, dry sewers and fears the economy may crumble, experts have warned. In its most recent census, Germany discovered it had lost 1.5 million inhabitants and, by 2060, experts say the population could dwindle by an extra 19 per cent, to about 66 million. Between 2000 and 2013, Germany's . birth rate dropped by 11 per cent compared to rises in the UK (4.3 per . cent), France (3.6 per cent), Spain (12.8 per cent) and Ireland (8.9 per cent). Now panic is beginning to spread through Europe's economic powerhouse as the financial crisis continues to stretch its tentacles into all aspects of society, especially the country's labour market. Adding to the country's woes, a recent study by Europe's Population Policy Acceptance Study found that 23 per cent of German men thought 'zero' was the ideal family size. 'In some areas, there are now abundant overgrown yards, boarded-up . windows and concerns about sewage systems too empty to work properly,' reports the New York Times. 'The work force is rapidly graying, and assembly lines are being . redesigned to minimize bending and lifting.' Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But despite spending $265 billion a year on family subsidies, experts say the government is not doing enough claiming Germany needs an overhaul of values, customs and attitudes. According to the New York Times Germany has for many decades had a fraught relationship with immigration. To make matters worse, attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness. Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer and make itself more appealing to immigrants, who, they say, tend to find other European nations far more hospitable destinations. It also needs to feed more women into the workforce while, at the same time, encourage them to have more babies. 'If you look closely at the numbers, what you see is the higher the gender equality, the higher the birthrate,' Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development told the New York Times. Keep working: Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer as fears grow for the country's workforce . But, he added, Germany has long subsidised families of a traditional set up, making change all the more difficult. 'Touching those is political suicide,' Michaela Kreyenfeld of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research told the paper. 'Women are perfectly integrated within Germany's labor market but when it comes to babies, everyone expects a mother to stay at home and take care of the children,' she told reuters last year. 'This of course deters women from becoming mothers.' Last year it emerged the number of births in Germany fell to a post-war low despite a raft of government incentives meant to reverse a population decline. 'Raven mother': Attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness . A third of all babies born in Germany, still the EU's most populous member state, came from immigrant families, the analysts said, noting that without them the overall figure would have been much lower. The preliminary data released by Germany's Federal Statistics Office showed 663,000 children were born in 2011, down from 678,000 in 2010. How Germany's birth rate compares to Europe (between 2000 and 2013): . 'As in every year since 1972, the number of people who died was greater than the number of children born. In 2011 the difference amounted to 190,000 people and in 2010 to 181,000,' the office said in a report. Demography experts have forecast that Germany's population could shrink to about 50 million by 2050, based on current trends, and say France and Britain - which now have about 60 million each - could overtake it later this century. Germany's birthrate peaked in 1964 when a total of 1,357,304 children were born in the capitalist West and communist East. West Germans were already having fewer children in the 1970s because of improving conditions for women and their easier access to education, said Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. 'So fewer children were born then, meaning that today we lack potential parents for potential children,\" he said.Without immigrant families, the number of newly born children in Germany would reach only 400,000 in a country of 82 million, Klingholz said. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has no children herself, introduced relatively generous child benefit payments in 2006, making it easier for women to return to the workplace after having children.In June 2012, however, in a move critics say entrenches a more traditionalist view of women's roles, Merkel's coalition also approved a bill on childcare payments that would give parents an allowance to keep their toddlers at home rather than sending them to nursery."}]}

Qantas' record $2.84 billion loss didn't come as a shock for a former flight attendant who worked 12 years for the company. Once known as the high-flying luxury airline, Mr Beddall says the iconic Australian brand fails to meet its high standards. Mr Beddall, who spent his career attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant, told Daily Mail Australia why The Flying Kangaroo is spiralling downhill and will continue to do so until the Australian government addresses 'the white elephant in the room'.

Mr Beddall met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) during his time as a first-class flight attendant for Qantas . The little luxuries are missing . Mr Beddall says Qantas used to pride itself in being a luxury brand with 'the whole package'. 'When I started, we gave our amenity packs which had ear plugs, pajamas, face mist sprays, face masks, expensive moisturisers,' he said. 'The economy class got a little kit too and there was even something for the children.' Mr Beddall, who maintains contact with his former colleagues who currently work for the airline, says passengers have to specifically ask for such services which puts them in 'an awkward position'. This is one of the reasons why he believes passengers are no longer getting their value for money. 'Qantas has taken away the little intricacies and although that may not be the stand alone reason why people don't fly with them anymore, people are paying top dollar and they're not satisfied,' he said. Qantas services and staff are failing to meet the expectations of passengers . Staff morale is at an all-time low . Mr Beddall says his colleagues used to be proud of working for such a landmark Australian brand. 'They would put on their uniform with pride - just as if it was like a military uniform,' he said. 'But now they're embarrassed, fearful for their jobs and disheartened with the union.' He says there's an overall dark element surrounding staff and it's affecting passengers and their flight experience. Mr Beddell says management and the board - including Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce (pictured) - should be held responsible . Board and management are terrible \u2026 and refuse to take responsibility . And it all comes down to the board and management. Mr Beddell says both should be changed immediately with intervention from the government. 'We need to address the white elephant in the room,' he said. The government needs to intervene to help Qantas financially and also get rid of Alan Joyce [Qantas Chief Executive].' He also made mention that Qantas has 'forgotten its Australian identity'. 'Passengers felt like they were home flying with Qantas - they even got little jars of Vegemite - but that feeling of comfort isn't there anymore,' he said. 'And that's such a shame because Qantas is such a beautiful iconic Australian brand.' The running down of economy class . Mr Beddell says passengers in economy class are getting the short end of the stick if they fly with Qantas. 'With the prices that they pay, the normal passengers should be getting the same respect as business class and quite frankly they're not,' he said. 'Me as a consumer - I wouldn't pay top dollar when you're treated just the same, if not better, on other airlines for a cheaper price.' Qantas no longer has 'the whole package', Mr Beddall said . Poor service and staffing . This also includes the dwindling number of cabin crew on board Qantas flights compared to other carriers. 'There aren't enough staff on board to tend to the passengers and this is another huge factor,' Mr Beddall said. The staff are also 'disengaged' and often miss the attention to detail. 'We used to be an airline with 100 per cent customer satisfaction,' Mr Beddall said. 'Let's face it, it's not like this anymore for both passengers and staff.' So where's the airline going now? 'On a rapid downhill slide,' Mr Beddall told Daily Mail Australia.

But on Friday the Chelsea manager said: \u2018The only thing that is not nice is that you compete against the ones who don\u2019t follow the same rules. That\u2019s the only problem. Jose Mourinho spoke to press on Friday ahead of Chelsea's trip to Aston Villa . Chelsea manager Mourinho was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self-imposed silence . Manchester City have had their 2014-15 Champions League squad cut from 25 players to 21 after breaching financial Fair Play rules . 'I don\u2019t think a team can be champions when you are punished, and it\u2019s happened before, because you didn\u2019t comply with FFP.\u2019 City signed \u00a328million Wilfried Bony in the January transfer window while Chelsea came out of the window \u00a37m better off through sales, despite bringing in Juan Cuadrado for \u00a327m. \u2018It\u2019s something that was explained before I joined,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018It was explained the profile of the club Mr Abramovich wants, with total respect for the FFP rules, to compete against the ones financially more powerful or the ones who don\u2019t respect FFP.\u2019 Mourinho was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined \u00a325,000 by the Football Association . Wilfried Bony is Manchester City's latest big-name signing - costing \u00a328million from Swansea . Mourinho insisted that Juan Cuadrado (left) was not a panic buy, but a reaction to Andre Schurrle's exit . Are you excited by Cuadrado? 'Normal.' Normal? 'Yeah. Normal.' What can he bring? 'I don't think it's the best thing for him that I speak about expectations. He needs his time, as everyone does. He will have his time. It's not a panic buy. It's a reaction to Schurrle, a departure that is not a panic buy because he's a player we've known for a long, long time. 'I've coached in his league for two seasons. We are happy with our business. Schurrle is a player we like very, very much but the business was very good. We are happy with it.' Any regret with Schurrle? 'No. No. We are happy with what he gave us. We are happy with the investment we did on him, one and a half years ago. We are happy with the profit we made in this transfer window. Hopefully we made him a better player. Hopefully he can have success in the future because we like him very much.' You never seem to win at Villa Park... why is this? 'Because the opponents score more goals than us, or sometimes the same number of goals.' They're the team with the least goals, you're the team with the most... hot favourites? 'I don't have to speak about Aston Villa.' What did you learn from that defeat last year? 'I learned nothing that I hadn't learned before that. There are matches that are impossible to win and you have to be smart enough to understand that. Afer so many years in football, there are matches that I clearly know it's impossible to win.' How many sides are there in the title race? 'That's not my problem. We are one side. It's up to the others to wonder whether they are title contenders or not. We consider we are, even if sometimes it's more difficult that it might be. But we consider ourselves contenders.' Team news? 'Filipe [Luis] is injured. The player [Diego Costa] is suspended.' Fabregas? 'I told you. Filipe is injured and the player who is suspended is suspended. Everybody (else) is fit.' Where will Cuadrado play in your team? 'Goalkeeper impossible because we don't need him there. Central defenders we don't need, and he's too small. After that he can play everywhere.' Is he ready now? 'I think he can, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him.' Can Mohammed Salah come back? 'He's a Chelsea player who is on loan. He's our player. When we sell the players, they're not ours. But he is our player.' Are you proud of the business you've done in the last few windows? 'That's not my job at the club. You have to give credit to the people in the club who deal with numbers. They deserve credit for that.' Does that game at Villa Park still rankle with you? 'I don't speak about it. I don't have to speak about it.' Drogba or Remy tomorrow? 'Yes. One (of them).' Five points clear, Capital One Cup final, Champions League last 16, you should be enjoying it. You don't appear to be? Is that fair? 'I'm enjoying my work with my players. When I like my players, when I like my squad, I'm much more happy, more motivated to work, and this is the case.' It's just when you speak to us? 'Speak to you? You know why I'm here, so you cannot expect that I'm super happy to be here.' So you're here because you have to be here? 'Yes.' Could Cuadrado start? Or does he need a bit longer to settle down? 'I'm going to repeat the words I said three weeks ago, so many now people can understand. I said, he fits into the Fiorentina and Colombia's team. At this moment, he fits in Colombia and Chelsea teams.' Is he at the right physical level? 'He trained just two days. I cannot say much. The business situation almost to the last minute on Monday, he had to go to Paris for visas and the legal situation on the Tuesday. He only trained here a couple of days. I cannot say much.' Why didn't you speak to the media before City? 'Because, if you want, you can make a silence very noisy. It depends what you want to do. You could. You could. You could make noise with my silence, because you know the reason for my silence. It depends on you. If I was a journalist, from silence I could make lots of words.' All because of Costa's ban? 'Not just (that).' How do you reflect on that suspension? 'I don't reflect, because maybe I'll be punished if I reflect. Maybe they can read my reflection, and I don't want that.' Any word on Kurt Zouma's progression? 'Good. Very good.' Do you expect more from him still? 'A kid of 20, I expect always to improve.' Are you pleased with your position? 'I feel the distance could be much bigger. If I analysed \u2013 which I'm not going to do \u2013 the last five, six, seven matches, we could, we should have a bigger difference.' Why no new deal announced with Hazard? 'Why should it be officialised? Why? What's the problem? He has a contract with Chelsea for two or three more years. Are you worried? I'm not worried. I'm not worried.' Varane at 18, now Zouma at 20 with Chelsea... are you impressed by both players, the future of the French team? 'I think the French federation should write me a letter to thank me because I think they have now the two best young defenders in the world. Not the two 'best', because they are young. There are final products, mature players of 25, 28, 30 years of age. But as young defenders, can you imagine what Zouma and Varane could represent in a couple of years? Didier [Deschamps] should be very happy with that. For sure.' Do you expect to be fined by the Premier League for not attending the media conferences? 'You know, the only surprise I had in relation for that was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that, I can expect everything.' Are you thinking about PSG? 'No. Three matches to play before that. I don't have time. I have to prepare Aston Villa, Everton and, after that, yes. After Everton I will prepare for PSG.' How did University affect your life? 'Every experience you have in life helps you to be what you are. University was five years of my life. For sure, it made a contribution to what I am. I cannot measure it. I can't say it's more important than being a manager's son, or more important than being an assistant to other managers. I don't know.'"}]}

A four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community . Chimpanzees are often photographed huddled in groups grooming each other and relaxing in trees, but they are also capable of usurping dominant males in vicious power struggles and waging wars that last for years. A brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community and leaving some members dead. Now scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down. Dame Goodall witnessed the violent and sustained fighting of the apes first hand and called it a war. She had set up a feeding station at Gombe to try and unravel why the conflict escalated from what was a harmonious group. Jospeh Feldblum of Duke University, North Carolina, has examined her field notes to build an in-depth model of the chimpanzee\u2019s social network. Dame Jane made incredibly detailed notes detailing which apes arrived at the feeding station at the same time and from which direction they travelled, New Scientist reported. Previously, scientists had estimated the strength of relationships between the amount of time two chimps spent together, but now Dr Feldblum\u2019s team has entered Dame Jane\u2019s data collected between 1968 and 1972 into a model to track how the group\u2019s relationship changed. Scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down . It suggests that the group was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970. Dr Feldblum told a meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Calgary, Canada: \u2018As soon as Leakey died they started splitting. He seems to have been a bridge between the northern and southern chimps. A younger chimp called Humphrey stepped into the power vacuum but he was challenged by two apes from the southern group called Hugh and Charlie. The study suggests that the group (stock image used) was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970 . The apes followed wither Humphrey or the southern brothers and a four year battle began, resulting in the deaths of seven males from the brother\u2019s \u2018rebel\u2019 group. While chimpanzees are known for their caring group dynamics, groups of Humphrey\u2019s \u2018army\u2019 would sneak behind rebel lines, pick a target and beat him up. Dr Feldblum discovered that it was possible to predict whether the chimp would support Humphrey or become a rebel and that the situation witnessed in the jungle resembles a power struggle in human society. He thinks that groups of chimpanzees might explain how human-like societies evolve. They have long been held as an almost human-like relative. But researchers have discovered chimpanzees have almost the same personality traits as humans. Georgia State University research shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee. They found the most fundamental personality trait for chimpanzees is dominance \u2013 that is, whether an animal is a generally dominant and undercontrolled 'Alpha,' or a more playful and sociable 'Beta.' But those two categories can be broken down statistically into smaller personality traits in ways that echo the personality structures researchers have found in child and adult human subjects. Alpha personalities, for example, statistically break down into tendencies toward dominance and disinhibition. Beta personalities, on the other hand, show low dominance and positive emotionality.Further analysis shows these lower order traits also can be statistically broken down into their constituent parts.The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect."}]}

The shooter, Michael McLedon, killed his mother before killing others. First Baptist Church, a few feet from the neighborhood where Michael McLendon, 28, opened fire Tuesday, welcomed members of this close community Wednesday night for a prayer service. \"It's what community is about, isn't it? Crying together. Holding each other,\" a pastor said. It's hard for many to believe the shooting rampage could happen in this town of about 2,100 people. Authorities said McLendon went to three towns, slaying 10 people. He started in his hometown of Kinston, killing his mother, before moving on to open fire in Samson and finally Geneva. McLendon was once a police officer in Samson, the small town hit hardest by the deadliest crime in Alabama history, authorities said. His nearly hourlong assault ended at the Reliable Metal Products plant in the last town, 24 miles from where it began and where police said McLendon engaged in a shootout before killing himself inside the building.

As would be expected, coping has been hard. \"It's a strange moment when you wake up in the morning and for that brief second everything is as it was,\" she says. \"And then you realize that nothing is ever as it was -- and never will be again.\" On Monday, after putting themselves \"in a little cocoon,\" as she put it, Hockley decided it was time to tell the world about Dylan. \"He was autistic,\" she says, \"but incredibly empathetic.\" \"He just wanted to have fun.\" Most of all, Dylan loved to bounce on a trampoline in the family's backyard, remembers his father. \"I'd say, 'Go out on the trampoline!' Ian Hockley says. \"And he would always say, 'Are you coming, Daddy?'\" Together, they would vault up on the trampoline and bounce, sometimes joined by Dylan's brother, Jake, who is two years older. \"If I didn't go, Dylan wouldn't go,\" Ian Hockley remembers. \"He just wanted to have so much fun with me.\" Just down the street lived Adam Lanza, 20. Authorities said Lanza opened fire inside Sandy Hook Elementary before taking his own life. They said he killed his mother, Nancy, before the school shooting. Asked whether they knew the Lanzas, Nicole Hockley stiffened and said no. But they say the pain has made it impossible to even drive past the Lanza home.

We will stay in Newtown, but that's just one thing too much. I can't do that every day.\" And they have trouble answering Jake's questions, such as why? And will this happen again? Nicole says these are not things an 8-year-old should have to worry about. But Ian says it's Jake's difficult questions that give them the will to get involved -- to try to make something positive come from the tragedy. \"We're just focusing on getting up each day,\" Nicole said.

But one detail has given the Hockleys comfort. A few days after the tragedy, the Hockleys ran into Mike Murphy. His wife, Anne Marie Murphy, taught their son at Sandy Hook. He revealed to her that -- in the terrible aftermath of the attack -- first responders found Dylan and his teacher together. \"He said that Anne Marie Murphy had been found with her arms wrapped around Dylan ... that is what we had hoped for -- in a very strange sort of way to hope for something.\" \"She loved him and he loved her and she would've looked after him no matter what,\" she says, fighting back tears. \"To know that he was with her, and that he wasn't alone, that gives you a huge peace of mind ... to know that he was loved even in those last moments.\" Obama says gun lobby stokes fear .

After gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past, on Tuesday they passed in at least two states. Rarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes. The result: Maryland and Maine will now allow couples like Chyrino Patane and James Trinidad to tie the knot. The Maryland couple has been together for seven years, and now, after the historic vote, they plan to marry in the next six months to a year. \"Both families will be at the wedding,\" Patane said. But the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small. \"We've lost at the ballot box 32 times,\" said Paul Guequierre of Human Rights Campaign. \"History was made tonight.\" In Maine, Erica Tobey and Ali Ouellette wed in September, but only now will the women's marriage be recognized under Maine law. \"It's hard to overstate the national significance of this vote,\" Marc Solomon, campaign director at Freedom to Marry, said of the Maine referendum. Related: French ministers back same-sex marriage . In Maryland, where just 51.9% of voters approved gay marriage rights, \"It was a little bit pins and needles,\" said Human Rights Campaign's Kevin Nix. \"It was going to be a close call all along.\" A similar ballot measure in Washington state is pending. And in Minnesota, voters rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. Pollsters got a hint of the coming change. Recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage, with a majority of Americans now approving of marriages between two men or two women. A June CNN/ORC poll, for example, reflected such a shift in opinion in the U.S. Support has been growing for decades. In the 1990s, most Americans told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. By 2010, the number of Americans who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49%. This year, that number stands at 60%. Maryland, Maine approve same-sex marriage . Election Day brought two additional gains for proponents of same-sex marriage: Wisconsin elected America's first openly lesbian senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, and President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage and get re-elected. Wisconsin's Baldwin is first openly gay person elected to Senate . \"I have never been this happy after an election in my 17 years of voting,\" said Derek Hurder from Hampden, Maine, who's been with his partner, Chris McLaughlin, for a year and a half. They're not yet ready for marriage, but they were elated about having the option. And they both voted to re-elect the president. The change in attitude makes them feel more comfortable, but that has its limits. \"I wouldn't feel safe walking down the street holding hands,\" Hurder said. Patane and Trinidad share their Catholic faith and are despondent that the church won't recognize their union. \"I believe in a religious marriage,\" Trinidad said. \"I recognize that it's going to be a nonreligious wedding.\" Tobey and Ouellette, who met four years ago, tied the knot last September -- in a church. \"We are affiliated with the United Methodist Church, which on the whole does not support same-sex marriage,\" Tobey said. But their church made a hearty exception. \"We had three pastors who know us and love us and agreed to do that for us.\" The legal situation led the couple to do things in reverse order. After their wedding, they applied for a name change. Now that the referendum has passed, they'll apply for a marriage license. Maine should begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples in mid-December, according to same-sex marriage supporters at Freedom to Marry. What the measures say . The two measures that passed, called \"Question 1\" in Maine and \"Question 6\" in Maryland, contain similar language. The words man and woman \"relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender-neutral for all purposes,\" the Maine measure says. Maryland's ballot reads, \"Civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license.\" Both measures also explicitly mention the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions. \"This chapter does not require any member of the clergy to perform or any church, religious denomination or other religious institution to host any marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of that member of the clergy, church, religious denomination or other religious institution,\" Maine's Question 1 states. The governments of Maine and Maryland had passed laws permitting same-sex marriage, but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on a ballot, said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, which raised $32 million for its campaigns on the referendums that included radio and television ads, social media strategy and on-the-ground canvassing by thousands of volunteers. Opponents of same-sex marriage say the new laws in both states will redefine marriage for everyone as a genderless union and endanger the fabric of society. \"Such a radical change in the definition of marriage will produce a host of societal conflicts that government -- exercising its enormous enforcement powers -- will have to resolve,\" argues Maryland Marriage Alliance. The group also published an online opinion by parents stating that legalizing same-sex marriage would lead to the promotion of homosexuality in school curriculum. Election results raise questions about Christian right's influence . Sainz believes the campaigns supporting the Maine measure paid off. In 2009, a similar referendum in Maine failed when voters rejected the governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage. Tuesday's results represent a remarkable turnaround. \"The secret to our success is that we won over hearts and minds,\" Sainz said. \"Americans are fair and want to see their gay and lesbian friends, co-workers and family members have the freedom to marry.\" Thirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In the six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. On election night, Tobey joined friends as they all watched results on TV. She wasn't expecting Maine's ballot to pass. But then they heard the news. \"I said: 'Hey, did that just happen?' \" She did a double take. CNN's Rose Arce contributed to this report."}]}

The last leg of the fastest road in America opened on Wednesday where the speed limit is 85mph. The final 41-mile stretch of Texas Highway 130 was finally finished after three years of construction. The toll road is intended to alleviate the crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio, which are two of the state's largest metropolitan areas. Scroll down for flyover of the new high-speed road . Controversial: The 85 mph speed limit has been approved for a 41-mile-long toll road near the increasingly crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio . The new stretch will be from . Mustang Ridge, ten miles south of Austin's international airport, . to Interstate 10, just east of Seguin. A 50-mile stretch bypassing . Austin is already open. Tolls . for cars displaying an electronic toll tag will be about . 15 cents per mile. But no tolls will be collected until November 11. The new stretch of high-speed road has prompted fears that fatalities could increase. 'The research is clear that when speed limits go up, fatalities go up,' said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, Rader said, 'but the trade-off is more crashes and more highway deaths.' A 2009 report in the American Journal of Public Health studied traffic fatalities in the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads. Speed strip: The map shows exactly where motorists can hit the gas . The study also said that rural . highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where . speed limits were raised, but did not cite specific numbers in those . instances. There are no longer any roads in the . U.S. with no speed limit like Germany's autobahn with most top speeds being 75mph. Some highways in rural . West Texas and Utah have 80 mph speed limits. The . Texas Legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new . stretches of road.\u00a0 The . Texas Transportation Commission, which is appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, . approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on August 30. A . transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment . on their decision. Agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road's topography, the speeds that most drivers were reaching, and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit. 'Safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one,' agency spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said. Record speeds: Map shows top speed limits across the U.S . Alan Guckian, who lives in Austin and regularly drives to Seguin to visit family, said he'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast. 'I would love it,' Guckian said. 'Sometimes it's fun to just open it up.' Steve Marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from Round Rock, north of Austin, to his job in San Antonio. The section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit. Marcy said he'd be comfortable driving 85, but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition. 'A tire blowout (at 85 mph) could be a big hazard,' Marcy said. Chris Lippincott, spokesman for SH 130 Concession Co. that is building the road, said the company is committed to operating a safe highway. 'On any road, drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic, travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles,' Lippincott said. Toll prices have not yet been set for the new section. Marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers, but said most won't think it's worth the cost of the tolls. 'For most people I talk to, it's a cost issue,' Marcy said."}]}

I can't say in any way that we shirk from it. We welcome it.\" A crush of cameras and journalists follows Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, each time he appears in court, including Thursday, when a grand jury indicted him on a first-degree murder charge in the execution-style shooting death of friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who is being held without bail, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Michael Fee, calls Hernandez an innocent man and says \"there has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case.\" According to a biography on his office's website, Sutter has worked to solve old homicides and \"has employed a series of new and aggressive strategies to attack the problem of gun violence.\" He was elected in 2006 and re-elected four years later. The Democrat lost a bid for Congress in 2012. Neither Sutter nor Fee can speak to the evidence because of a court-imposed gag order. \"We have won 14 out of our last 15 murder trials,\" Sutter said. \"I think that's a pretty darn good record.\" The next step in Hernandez's case is his arraignment, during which he'll be informed of the crimes he is charged with. Hernandez also faces five weapons charges. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted. He was charged with being accessory after the fact to murder. The grand jury also has indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. She's charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury, despite being granted immunity. Lloyd's body was found June 17, riddled with five bullets in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez' luxury home in North Attleborough. From there, it's roughly a 20 minute drive to the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment. Sources have told CNN that Ortiz, who is facing a weapons allegation, is cooperating with authorities. Sutter won't say whether Ortiz is getting a special deal. \"Mr. Ortiz is charged with a serious crime,\" Sutter told CNN. \"Whether or not he's indicted remains to be seen, but right now, he's not getting a pass.\" In search warrant affidavits for her home, investigators allege Singleton helped Wallace escape by buying him a bus ticket to Florida. Sutter said Singleton's refusal to testify is \"definitely unusual.\" \"We'll see what she does. But I'm not gonna comment on her position, her defiance,\" Sutter said. Singleton's lawyer, Peter Parker, declined comment to CNN. His client has pleaded not guilty. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan suggested that Singleton's decision may indicate she's either extremely loyal or may be worried about something. \"Her refusal of immunity is very surprising,\" he said. As the case moves to Massachusetts Superior Court, Hernandez continues to be held without bail. No trial date has been set."}]}

Do not exceed 80 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- The election of 736 members from 27 member countries to the European Parliament in June will be the biggest transnational electoral contest there has ever been.  Between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people. About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote. But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest. Who will be voting, when and where? About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five-year term. The elections will be held on Thursday, June 4 in the UK and the Netherlands. There will be voting on Friday, June 5 in Ireland and the Czech Republic. And it will begin on Saturday, June 6 in Cyprus, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia. The other countries will conduct their voting on Sunday, June 7. Elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the EU, with the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania included for the first time. How many MEPs are there and how many does each country elect? There will be 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the new assembly. The number each country has varies according to its population. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. Malta, with a total population of just 410,000, will have only 5. Will that number stay the same if the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect? No. The Lisbon Treaty, designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU (and to increase the powers of the European Parliament,) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland, the only country to give electors a direct voice. But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula. That means that 15 'ghost MEPs', will be elected on June 7, entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through. What election system is used? That varies according to the individual states represented, but all will be using some variant of proportional representation. In some countries candidates will all be on a single national list, making the entire country a constituency. Others elect MEPs from regional constituencies. Many countries set a threshold, insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in France and Germany, 4 per cent in Sweden or Austria -- to qualify for any allocation of seats. Whom do the MEPs represent? Most would-be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties. National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates. But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group (PES), the Liberal Group (ELDR) or the European Greens. The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party (EPP). However, David Cameron, the national leader of Britain's Conservatives, has withdrawn his members from the EPP, regarding it as too federalist in its approach. The groups work as a bloc when they can and have \"whips\" designed to make them as cohesive as possible. What powers do the MEPs have? Much legislation in member states actually originates at a European level. National legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which the MEPs have helped to shape. They are the only elected part of the European apparatus which is otherwise dominated by European Councils (meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations) or the European Commission. Do MEPs really make much difference to ordinary people's lives? It may not feel like it, day to day, but MEPs often have more influence over the shaping of European legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the \"roaming directive\" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. It was the EU which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism . And the so-called \"REACH\" directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe. Because driving legislation through the European Parliament requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the European Parliament end up as law. That is why company lobbyists spent much time in Brussels trying to make their case to MEPs. But does the Parliament have any muscle? It has the rather drastic power to sack the European Commission. It also holds public hearings on newly-appointed Commissioners. The Parliament also has significant powers over how much of the European Union budget is spent. Although most legislation originates with the Commission, if more than 50 percent of MEPs back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the Commission has to get down to work to propose some. The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world, dispensing some $15 billion a year across five continents and MEPs have a significant say in that. Where is the European Parliament situated? Most of its meetings are held in Brussels close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the Parliament's subject committees. But, at a considerable cost, some plenary meetings are also held in Strasbourg, an arrangement which the French government has fought long and hard to maintain."}]}

The temple was discovered in 2009 near Nebelivka in the Ukraine. It measures 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres). The two storey structure was made from wood and clay, with a courtyard. It is divided into rooms that held clay 'altars' and had red walls. Pottery fragments, humanlike figurines and gold hair ornaments were found. The structure was at the heart of a prehistoric village covering 288 acres (238 hectares). They discovered the remains of eight clay platforms that may have been used as altars, as well as \u2018numerous burnt bones of lamb, associated with sacrifice\u2019, according to the journal Tyragetia. The researchers, of the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the floors and walls of the rooms could have been decorated with red paint \u2013 perhaps to create a sacrificial atmosphere. There were seven \u2018altars\u2019 on the ground floor as well as a courtyard filled with animal bones and fragments of pottery. Clay humanlike figurines were found, which have beak-like noses and eyes that look as if they are mismatched because they are different sizes. Hair decorations made of gold and measuring less than an inch in size were unearthed too. The settlement would have contained more than 1,200 buildings and 50 streets. The complex temple was built in the Ukraine at least 1,000 years before Stonehenge (pictured).\u00a0Archaeologists believe the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire was built anywhere from 3000 BC to 2000 BC .

It is not known what the human figures (pictured) were used for at the temple, but similar figurines have been discovered at similar prehistoric sites in the Ukraine and eastern Europe . It was a similar size to others found in the Ukraine and in and other parts of Eastern Europe, which belonged to the \u2018Trypillian\u2019 culture. The modern name is inspired by the village of Trypillia, where artefacts from the ancient culture, similar to the figures found at the site,  were first discovered. Archaeologists believe that the settlement at Nebelivka was abandoned by ancient people, who burned the temple down. This is believed to have happened at several Trypillian sites. Curiously, temples of a similar size and design were being built in the Middle East between the fifth to fourth millennia BC, the researchers said. For example, a 6,000-year old temple at the ancient city of Eridu, in modern-day Iraq was also divided into small rooms."}]}

He painted a picture of a strong economy that is open to those who are \"ready to be partners\" and invest in Russia. Follow the action live on CNN.com . This year Davos, a picturesque Swiss ski resort, is hosting nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives. The world's top policymakers gather annually to discuss global issues, and are this time meeting under the banner of \"resilient dynamism.\" Medvedev sought to position himself as a reformer in a country that is moving determinedly forward. \"Russia is an open country, whatever they might think or say,\" he said, referring to critics of its record on corruption and governance issues. Russia's unemployment rate, at a little over 5%, is the lowest among developed countries, he said, and it also has an extremely low level of foreign debt. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos . \"We need to see investment growing by 10% annually,\" he said. \"Therefore we are interested in attracting large-scale foreign investment.\" That amount of investment expansion is needed to push Russia's economy beyond 4% growth, he said. But Medvedev acknowledged that Russia needs to do a much better job of attracting foreign direct investment. Russia ranks very low in global corruption indices, which has held back investment despite a sizable population of 142 million. Medvedev said his government's priority is to improve public governance. But, he said, this is not a problem unique to Russia. Is the rise of China creating conflict? \"It's nothing new --- humanity has been facing these problems for centuries, if not millennia,\" he said. \"The more law and order, the more thieves and robbers. In that sense, little has changed.\" Medvedev stressed that Russia is an open market now and pointed to membership in the World Trade Organization as a indication of that. The country's next priority is to gain membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, composed of the world's industrialized nations, he said. Interactive: Europe's tale of boom and bust . The prime minister suggested this sends a strong message to the world, even though both structures \"are not perfect,\" in his view. He also spoke of the need to create an equal playing field for all businesses and to create a \"single economic space\" with Russia's neighbors, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But the prime minister dismissed suggestions that this is an effort to somehow recreate the Soviet Union, saying Russia wants to play in the global market. Interactive: How's your economic mood? \"There is no going back to the past,\" he said. Executives have not been convinced in the past that Medvedev and Russian President Vladimir Putin are on the same page. But the prime minister stressed that Russia has a global outlook and will continue dialogue with its European friends and partners. \"We are building our cooperation,\" he said, acknowledging that unilateral action could have \"dire implications.\" Medvedev said the G-20, which brings together the world's major economies, is becoming increasingly efficient and that this has helped limit the extent of the global economic crisis. \"We need to use modern technologies, crowd sourcing,\" he said. \"Those technologies change the status and enhance the legitimacy of decisions made in government.\" Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? The speech echoed one Medvedev gave at Davos as his country's president in 2011, when he also pushed foreign investment in Russia while acknowledging that reforms were needed. Russia last month assumed the rotating presidency of the G-20. \"The Russian presidency's main task will be to focus the G-20's efforts on developing measures to stimulate economic growth and create jobs,\" Putin said at the time. Few are likely to dispute Medvedev's comments on the need for Russia to prioritize governance issues. Russia ranked 133 out of 174 in Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. Ahead of the World Economic Forum, the non-governmental group's chairwoman, Huguette Labelle, called on countries and businesses to change the way they work, for everybody's sake. \"Future prosperity will always be undermined by corruption, excessive risk-taking, a lack of transparency and other unethical practices,\" she warned. Pavel Khodorkovsky, the son of jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and president of the U.S.-based Institute of Modern Russia, also wrote an open letter to those at the World Economic Forum in which he highlighted the plight of his father. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who backed an opposition party, has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Russia has faced wide criticism over his treatment, with the United States and others accusing it of \"selective prosecution\" and abuse of the legal system. His son, in his letter to policymakers at Davos, called on them to raise the issue of the former Yukos chief executive's continued imprisonment and urge support for the rule of law in Russia. \"Ending corruption is not just a human rights issue,\" Pavel Khodorkovsky said. \"The proliferation of corruption remains a huge impediment to direct foreign investment. \"Both U.S. and Russian officials have publicly acknowledged Russia's weak property rights and rampant corruption are reasons to avoid doing business in Russia. This is thwarting job creation and starving Russian businesses of the capital they need to grow.\" Medvedev's comments come amid frosty relations with the United States after Putin signed a law in December prohibiting Americans from adopting Russian children. The move by Russian politicians was widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on those it considers human rights abusers in Russia."}]}

Bob Richards: Aiming for the Moon . Richards was just one of many children left wide-eyed and inspired by the moon landings. But for him, they were a false start. \"I had this enormous expectation that I would have an experience in space. It just didn't happen,\" Richards says. Man stepped on the moon, but only to prove a point. \"We faltered,\" he explains. \"We didn't continue our operations on the moon; we didn't go to Mars.\" Now, Richards and his colleagues are bringing their childhood dreams to life, as part of the burgeoning NewSpace movement, which has sparked a renaissance in space exploration. The children of the moon landings have grown up: they now hold the positions of power to make their dreams come alive. \"They want to make the world of 'Star Trek,' of '2001,' and now ... they're in charge of NASA, they're in charge of the private companies, and they're making it happen,\" he explains. Richards says his path to the stars was \"inevitable.\" Inspired by science fiction authors like his friend, Arthur C. Clarke, visionaries like Carl Sagan and movies like \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" he studied aerospace and industrial engineering at Ryerson University, then physics and astronomy at the University of Toronto, before moving to Cornell to study space science, where he became special assistant to Sagan. Now, Richards is the ringleader behind Odyssey Moon, a company formed on the Isle of Man to pursue commercial ventures on the moon. The team were the first to enter the Lunar X prize, a Google-sponsored competition with a $20million jackpot for the first privately funded team to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon and send images and data back to Earth. But the X Prize is not Richards' only goal. He thinks that there are fortunes to be made in space -- and he plans to be the first lunar entrepreneur. \"We believe that beyond the prize, there's actually ongoing commerce on the surface of the moon,\" he reveals. Innovation and collaboration, both important drivers in the Odyssey Moon team, are the key to humanity's future, believes Richards. \"Space, by its nature, is an international endeavour,\" he says. \"Every space program will be successful based on the amount of international cooperation it's able to achieve.\" With that in mind, in 1987 he founded the International Space University, which educates students from all over the world in space technology. \"We're creating a universal planetary culture looking on space as an achievement and a goal for all humanity.\" For now, Richards' sights are set on the moon. \"The Google X Prize has certainly captivated my enthusiasm and interest, and I would certainly like to win that,\" he says. But he also sees Earth's satellite as a stepping stone to the stars. He confesses, \"If somebody was going to offer an X Prize for Mars, I'd be going for that ...\""}]}

It is something many women have probably done \u2013 find a style of dress that means you can fit into a size smaller than normal. And Amanda Holden has admitted she is not immune \u2013 preferring Victoria Beckham dresses because she can wear an eight, whereas she would normally be a ten. Yesterday, Holden, 43, revealed the brand is among her favourites, because its dresses come up bigger than usual. It means she can have the satisfaction of believing she has fitted into a trimmer size than usual. And coming just weeks after she revealed she had given up wearing Spanx underwear, it would seem Holden has found a canny new way of flattering her shape. Giving an interview, the actress and Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge said: \u2018I love the fact that [Victoria Beckham\u2019s] sizes are quite generous. I can happily fit into a Victoria Beckham size eight, when I actually think I\u2019m more a size 10.\u2019 She added: \u2018I love Victoria. I\u2019ve met her a few times and she\u2019s funny and sparky and, I think, much misunderstood sometimes. I feel this strange connection to her even though I don\u2019t really know her at all. \u2018I\u2019m thrilled that her fashion lines have been so successful because I\u2019m sure there were a lot of people who would have loved to see her fall flat on her face. Her dresses are incredible and the pieces I\u2019ve had, I just know I\u2019m going to wear them forever or keep them for my girls.\u2019 Amanda Holden has two daughters by her present husband record producer Chris Hughes who was also the former drummer for Adam and the Ants . Her girls are Lexi, eight, and two-year-old Hollie, from Holden\u2019s second marriage to record producer and the former drummer for Adam and the Ants Chris Hughes, 60. Her first marriage, to the actor and comedian Les Dennis, 60, ended in divorce, after Holden had an affair with the actor Neil Morrissey, 51. And giving an interview to this week\u2019s Hello! magazine, Holden went on to describe her daughters as \u2018girlie girls\u2019, who have inherited their mother\u2019s eye for fashion. Holden said: \u2018Hollie literally goes around the house with a crown on. I deliberately bought her a fire engine, a bus, a racing car so as not to stereotype her, but she goes around in a cape and tiara waving a wand. She loves playing with make-up. At the moment she\u2019s into red lipstick \u2013 the slutty look.\u2019 She added: \u2018Lexi has such a good eye for putting an outfit together. I took her into Zara the other day to choose a new outfit and I looked at what she\u2019d picked out and thought, \u201cWow, Lexi, you\u2019ve got that spot on\u201d.\u2019 Holden, 43, shows off her black fingernails on Britain's Got Talent . Earlier this year Holden revealed she had given up wearing Spanx \u2013 the shaping underwear which is popular for its ability to help flatten the stomach area \u2013 because she had found yoga. And she told the magazine: \u2018I was very open about my love of Spanx but by not eating cake every day and doing a bit of yoga, I\u2019ve realised I can get away without them. \u2018Also, I\u2019m not the most graceful at getting out of cars and there were a few paparazzi shots of me where you could see them. It\u2019s not a great look, is it? No one wants to see my sturdy trunks.\u2019"}]}
