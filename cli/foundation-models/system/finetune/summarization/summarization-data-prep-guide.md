# `Data preparation`

## 1. Xsum Dataset

The dataset has the documents and summaries of the news articles from BBC. The dataset has 3 keys - `document`, `summary`, `id`. The keys `document` and `summary`, or any customized versions of the keys, needs to be mentioned in the *parameters* section of [DataPreprocess component](../finetune/docs/component_docs/preprocess_component.md).The dataset could contain additional keys along with `document` and `summary` which will be ignored during data preprocessing. For instance, `id` key will be ignored during preprocessing.

Below is the script to download the data from Hugging Face and save it in the **jsonl** format

```python

    # install Hugging Face datasets package using `pip install datasets==2.3.2`
    from datasets import load_dataset

    dataset_name = "xsum"
    split = "test"  # change the split to download train and validation data
    ds = load_dataset(dataset_name, split=split)
    ds.to_json("{}_{}.jsonl".format(dataset_name, split))

```

## 2. Dataset filter

During data preprocessing, few or more lines of the jsonl file gets filtered if the value of the keys are in the invalid values shown below

|Column Name|Invalid values|
|---|---|
|**document_key**|None, ""(empty string)|
|**summary_key**|None, ""(empty string)|

## 3. Accepted data types

Currently 4 types of datasets are supported - CSV, JSONL, paraquet, MLTable

The Azureml finetune components accepts two keys, referred to as `document_key` and `summary_key` in the component parameters. The table below shows the accepted data types for the value of each of the keys.

|document_key|summary_key|
|---|---|
|string|string|

To interpret this in the above xsum dataset, **document** (*document_key*) should be of string dtype and **summary** (*summary_key*) should also be of string dtype.

## 4. Example

##### Here is an example of how the data should look like

The summarization dataset is expected to have 2 fields â€“ document, summary like shown below.
