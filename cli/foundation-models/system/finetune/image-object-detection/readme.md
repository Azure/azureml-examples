# Fine-tuning a model for Image Object Detection task

You can launch a sample pipeline for image object detection using `mmdetection_image_objectdetection_instancesegmentation_pipeline` component.

For using this component for object detection, run the shell script file `bash ./mmdetection-fridgeobjects-detection.sh`.

Currently following models are supported:
| Model Name | Source |
| ------ | ---------- |
| [Image object detection models from MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/main/docs/en/model_zoo.md) | MMDetection |
| TODO | azureml-preview registry |
