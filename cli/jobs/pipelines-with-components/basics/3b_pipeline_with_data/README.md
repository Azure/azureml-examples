This is a simple pipeline with 3 Component Jobs with data dependencies. Output of job A is used as input by job B using the syntax `${{parent.jobs.componentA.outputs.componentA_output}}` and output of job B is used as input by job C using the syntax `${{parent.jobs.componentB.outputs.componentB_output}}`. Output of job C maps to pipeline output `final_pipeline_output`. Outputs of job A and job B are intermediate data outputs since they do not map to any pipeline level outputs. Check if you have `cpu-cluster` compute and run this job using `az ml job create --file pipeline.yml`.
