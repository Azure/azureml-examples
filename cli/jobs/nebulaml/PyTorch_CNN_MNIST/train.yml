# compute cluster on which the command above should be run
# note: before you can use the compute, it needs to be created first in your AzureML workspace
compute: gpu-cluster

# compute resources
resources:
    # number of nodes in the cluster above
    instance_count: 1

# environment in which the command above should be run in
# note: It is recommended to use an environment which either is the ACPT image or at least inherits from it. The ACPT
#       image has many frameworks related to PyTorch pre-installed, hence reduces efforts to create your own
#       environment. To learn more about environments in AML, see

# for the latest ACPT image using PyTorch 1.12, CUDA 11.6 on Python 3.9
# environment: azureml:acpt-pytorch-1.12-py39-cuda11.6@latest
environment: AzureML-acpt-pytorch-2.0-cuda11.7 
# for a specific version
#environment: azureml:AzureML-ACPT-pytorch-1.12-py39-cuda11.6-gpu:3
# for the latest version of a custom environment:  (====install Nebula in dockerfile environment=====)
#environment: azureml:ACPT-Extended@latest
# for a specific Docker image (has to be compatible with Azure ML):
#environment:
#    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/curated/acpt-pytorch-1.12-py39-cuda11.6-gpu:2

# command that should be run by the job (====install Nebula with comand OR use dockerfile environment=====)
