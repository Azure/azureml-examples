# compute cluster on which the command above should be run
# note: before you can use the compute, it needs to be created first in your AzureML workspace
compute: gpu-v100-1GPU-cluster

# compute resources
resources:
    # number of nodes in the cluster above

# environment in which the command above should be run in
# note: It is recommended to use an environment which either is the ACPT image or at least inherits from it. The ACPT
#       image has many frameworks related to PyTorch pre-installed, hence reduces efforts to create your own
#       environment. To learn more about environments in AML, see

# for the latest ACPT image using PyTorch 2.2, CUDA 12.1 on Python 3.10
# environment: azureml:AzureML-acpt-pytorch-2.8-cuda12.6@latest
environment: azureml:AzureML-acpt-pytorch-2.8-cuda12.6@latest
# for a specific version
#environment: azureml:AzureML-acpt-pytorch-2.8-cuda12.6:1
# for the latest version of a custom environment:  (====install Nebula in dockerfile environment=====)
#environment: azureml:ACPT-Extended@latest
# for a specific Docker image (has to be compatible with Azure ML):
#environment:
#    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/curated/acpt-pytorch-2.8-cuda12.6:1
