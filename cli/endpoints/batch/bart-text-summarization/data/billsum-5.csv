These license-exempt providers are known as registered trustline child care providers. Existing law also requires a licensed child day care facility to make available to the public licensing reports and other licensing documents that pertain to a facility visit or a substantiated complaint investigation, among other licensing issues.
Existing law establishes in the State Treasury the Child Health and Safety Fund. Existing law authorizes the department to allocate these funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes that include, among other things, technical assistance, orientation, training, and education of child day care facility providers.
This bill would require an online child care job posting service providing online information about nonlicensed potential child care providers to include a specified statement regarding the trustline registry on its Internet Web site in California. The bill would also require an online child care job posting service providing online information about licensed potential child care providers to include a statement regarding a parent’s right to specified complaint information on its Internet Web site in California. If an online child care job posting service provides access to a background check, the bill would require the service to include, on its Internet Web site in California, a written description of the background check provided by the background check service provider. The bill would make a background check service provider responsible for providing the online child care job posting service with certain information.

SECTION 1.
Section 1212 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
1212.
(a) Any person, firm, association, partnership, or corporation desiring a license for a clinic or a special permit for special services under the provisions of this chapter, shall file with the department a verified application on forms prescribed and furnished by the department, containing the following:
(1) Evidence satisfactory to the department that the applicant is of reputable and responsible character.

However, the clinic shall notify the department, in writing, of the change in service or physical plant no less than 60 days prior to adding the service or remodeling or modifying, or adding an additional physical plant maintained and operated on a separate premises to, an existing primary care clinic site. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the authority of the department to conduct an inspection at any time pursuant to Section 1227, in order to ensure compliance with, or to prevent a violation of, this chapter, or any regulation adopted under this chapter.
(2) If applicable city, county, or state law obligates the primary care clinic to obtain a building permit with respect to the remodeling or modification to be performed by the clinic, or the construction of a new physical plant, the primary care clinic shall provide a signed certification or statement as described in Section 1226.3 to the department within 60 days following completion of the remodeling, modification, or construction project covered by the building permit.
(c) In the course of fulfilling its obligations under Section 1221.09, the department shall ensure that any application form utilized by a primary care clinic, requiring information of the type specified in paragraph (1), (4), (8), or (9) of subdivision (a), is consistent with the requirements of Section 1225, including the requirement that rules and regulations for primary care clinics be separate and distinct from the rules and regulations for specialty clinics. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the department to issue a separate application form for primary care clinics.
(d) (1) The department, upon written notification by a primary care clinic or an affiliate clinic of its intent to add an additional physical plant maintained and operated on separate premises, as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and upon payment of a licensing fee for each additional physical plant added, shall review the information provided in the notification, and if the information submitted is in compliance with the requirements specified in this subdivision, the department shall approve the additional physical plant within 30 days of all information being submitted and shall amend the primary care clinic or affiliate clinic’s license to include the additional physical plant as part of a single consolidated license.

(2) Written notification shall include evidence that the primary care clinic or affiliate clinic is licensed in good standing and otherwise meets the criteria specified in this subdivision. In issuing the single consolidated license, the department shall specify the location of each physical plant.

(5) A primary care clinic or an affiliate clinic may add additional physical plants pursuant to this section that are no more than one-half mile from the licensed clinic adding the additional physical plant under a consolidated license.
(6) Upon renewal of a consolidated license approved pursuant to this subdivision, a licensee fee shall be required for each additional physical plant approved on the license.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the State Department of Public Health licenses and regulates primary care clinics, as defined. A violation of those provisions is a crime under existing law. Existing law authorizes a clinic corporation, on behalf of a primary care clinic that has held a valid, unrevoked, and unsuspended license for at least the immediately preceding 5 years, with no demonstrated history of repeated or uncorrected violations of specified provisions that pose immediate jeopardy to a patient, and that has no pending action to suspend or revoke its license, to file an affiliate clinic application to establish a primary care clinic at an additional site. Existing law provides that no application for licensure is required if a licensed primary care clinic adds a service that is not a special service, as defined, or remodels or modifies an existing primary care clinic site, but requires the clinic to notify the department of these events, as specified.
This bill would, among other things, expand that exception from licensure, and that notice requirement, to include a licensed primary care clinic or affiliate clinic that adds an additional physical plant maintained and operated on separate premises. The bill would require the department, upon written notification by a primary care clinic or affiliate clinic of its intent to add an additional physical plant maintained and operated on separate premises and upon payment of a licensing fee for each additional physical plant added, to review the information provided in the notification, and if the information submitted is in compliance with specified requirements, require the department to approve the additional physical plant within 30 days of all information being submitted, and to amend the primary care clinic or affiliate clinic’s license to include the additional physical plant as part of a single consolidated license. Because the bill would create a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1212 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to clinics."

SECTION 1.
Section 18904.25 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
18904.25.
(a) Pursuant to the federal Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Public Law 100-77), the department shall develop CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to the homeless population, including unaccompanied homeless children and youths, as those terms are defined in Section 11434a of Title 42 of the United States Code. The department shall also develop information on expedited services specified in Section 18914.5 for victims of domestic violence. This information shall be made available to homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, emergency food programs, local educational agency liaisons for homeless children and youths, designated pursuant to Section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and other community agencies who provide services to people who are homeless.
(b) Each county human services agency shall annually offer training on CalFresh application procedures to homeless shelter operators. That training shall include eligibility criteria and specific information regarding the eligibility of unaccompanied homeless children and youths. In addition, each county human services agency, upon request, shall provide homeless shelters and domestic violence shelters with a supply of that portion of the CalFresh application used to request CalFresh expedited service.
(c) Upon receipt of a signed CalFresh application from an unaccompanied child or youth under 18 years of age, the county human services agency shall determine eligibility for CalFresh benefits, including making a determination of whether the child or youth is eligible to apply as a household of one or if he or she must apply with members of a household with whom he or she is regularly purchasing and preparing foods, and screen the application for entitlement to expedited service pursuant to Section 18914. If the application of the child or youth for CalFresh benefits is denied, the county human services agency shall provide the child or youth a written notice explaining the reason for the denial.
SEC. 2.
Section 18914.5 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
18914.5.
(a) To the extent permitted by federal law, regulations, waivers, and directives, a resident of, or an individual on a waiting list to get into, a shelter for battered women and children who is currently included in a certified household that also contains the abuser, may apply for and, if otherwise eligible, shall be entitled to expedited services of an additional allotment of CalFresh benefits as a separate household.
(b) For purposes of this section, “shelter for battered women and children” has the same meaning as provided in Section 271.2 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
SEC. 3.
Section 18926.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
18926.5.
(a) For the purposes of this chapter, “CalFresh Employment and Training program” or “CalFresh E&T” means the program established under Section 6(d)(4)(B) of the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2015), Section 273.7 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and associated administrative notices published by the United States Department of Agriculture with the purpose of assisting members of CalFresh households in gaining skills, training, work, or experience that will increase their ability to obtain regular employment.
(b) (1) A county that elects to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training (CalFresh E&T) program, as authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2015), shall screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be deferred from, CalFresh E&T. If deferred, a CalFresh work registrant may request to enroll in CalFresh E&T as a voluntary participant. An individual shall be deferred from a mandatory placement in CalFresh E&T if he or she satisfies any of the criteria in Sections 273.7 and 273.24 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations, if he or she resides in a federally determined work surplus area, if he or she is a veteran who has been honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces, or if he or she is a victim of domestic violence.
(2) For purposes of this section, “deferred” has the same meaning as exempt.
(c) (1) A county participating in CalFresh E&T shall be required to demonstrate in its CalFresh E&T plan how it is effectively using CalFresh E&T funds for each of the components that the county offers, including, but not limited to, any of the following:
(A) Self-initiated workfare.
(B) Work experience or training.
(C) Education.
(D) Job search.
(E) The support services or client reimbursements needed to participate in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, as allowed by federal law and guidance.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a county to offer a particular component as a part of its CalFresh E&T plan.
(d) Nothing in this section shall limit a county’s ability to condition the receipt of nonmedical benefits under Section 17000 on an individual’s participation in an employment and training or workfare program of the county’s choice, even if that program is financed in whole or in part with CalFresh E&T funds or match funds.
(e) Nothing in this section shall restrict the use of federal funds for the financing of CalFresh E&T programs.
(f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a county to provide for workers’ compensation coverage for a CalFresh E&T participant. Notwithstanding Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200) of the Labor Code, a CalFresh E&T participant shall not be an employee for the purposes of workers’ compensation coverage, and a county shall have no duty to provide workers’ compensation coverage for a CalFresh E&T participant.
(g) Notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the department may implement this section by all-county letters or similar instructions. Thereafter, the department shall adopt regulations to implement this section by October 1, 2013.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing federal law provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh, formerly the Food Stamp Program, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Existing federal law authorizes a resident of a shelter for battered women and children, as defined, who is currently included in a certified household that also contains the abuser, to apply and, if otherwise eligible, receive an additional allotment of benefits as a separate household. Existing federal law requires a county human services agency to provide CalFresh expedited services to certain households.
This bill would, to the extent permitted by federal law, regulations, waivers, and directives, authorize a resident of, or an individual on a waiting list to get into, a shelter for battered women and children who is currently included in a certified household that also contains the abuser, to apply for, and, if otherwise eligible, would provide that the resident or individual is entitled to, expedited services of an additional allotment of CalFresh benefits as a separate household. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to develop and make available to homeless shelters, among other locations, CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to the homeless population. Existing law requires each county welfare department, upon request, to provide homeless shelters with a supply of CalFresh applications used to request expedited CalFresh services, as specified.
This bill would additionally require the department to develop and make available to domestic violence shelters CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to victims of domestic violence. The bill would also require a county human services agency, upon request, to provide domestic violence shelters with a supply of CalFresh applications used to request expedited CalFresh services, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training program (CalFresh E&T), established by federal law, and requires participating counties to screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be deferred from, CalFresh E&T. Existing law defers from mandatory placement in CalFresh E&T specified individuals, including an individual who is a veteran who has been honorably discharged from the United States Army.
This bill would additionally defer from mandatory placement in CalFresh E&T, an individual who is a victim of domestic violence.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 18904.25 and 18926.5 of, and to add Section 18914.5 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalFresh."

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families using a combination of federal, state, and county funds. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish an income reporting threshold for CalWORKs recipients, including CalWORKs assistance units that do not include an eligible adult, and requires a recipient to notify the county, within 10 days, if the recipient’s household income exceeds the reporting threshold. Existing law requires a CalWORKs assistance unit that does not include an eligible adult to also notify the county, within 10 days, of any change in the recipient’s household composition. Under existing law, if the county determines that the recipient is ineligible for CalWORKs or the recipient’s grant amount should be reduced based on an increase in income or a change in household composition, the county is required to discontinue the recipient from CalWORKs or reduce the recipient’s grant, with timely and adequate notice, as specified. Existing law provides that current and future grants may be reduced because of prior overpayments.
This bill would prohibit the county from assessing an overpayment for the month following a change in income for a recipient of CalWORKs, or following a change in household composition for a CalWORKs assistance unit that does not include an eligible adult, if the recipient has reported the change and the county was unable, before the first of the month following the change in income or household composition, to provide 10 days’ notice of the termination or reduction in benefits. By increasing the administrative duties of counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to issue an all-county letter or similar instruction by July 1, 2017, and adopt regulations by July 1, 2018, as necessary to implement these provisions.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 11265.3 and 11265.47 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."

If the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service’s Internet Web site, existing law requires a contract between an artist and a talent service to contain a notice that the talent service will remove the content within 10 days of a request by the artist or the artist’s parent or guardian, if a minor.

The bill would expand the above-described notice requirement to contracts in which the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service’s online service, online application, or mobile application.

The procedures for redetermining Medi-Cal eligibility described in this section shall apply to all Medi-Cal beneficiaries.
(b)  Loss of eligibility for cash aid under that program shall not result in a redetermination under this section unless the reason for the loss of eligibility is one that would result in the need for a redetermination for a person whose eligibility for Medi-Cal under Section 14005.30 was determined without a concurrent determination of eligibility for cash aid under the CalWORKs program.
(c) A loss of contact, as evidenced by the return of mail marked in such a way as to indicate that it could not be delivered to the intended recipient or that there was no forwarding address, shall require a prompt redetermination according to the procedures set forth in this section.
(d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, Medi-Cal eligibility shall continue during the redetermination process described in this section and a beneficiary’s Medi-Cal eligibility shall not be terminated under this section until the county makes a specific determination based on facts clearly demonstrating that the beneficiary is no longer eligible for Medi-Cal benefits under any basis and due process rights guaranteed under this division have been met. For the purposes of this subdivision, for a beneficiary who is subject to the use of MAGI-based financial methods, the determination of whether the beneficiary is eligible for Medi-Cal benefits under any basis shall include, but is not limited to, a determination of eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits on a basis that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods only if either of the following occurs:
(1) The county assesses the beneficiary as being potentially eligible under a program that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods, including, but not limited to, on the basis of age, blindness, disability, or the need for long-term care services and supports.
(2) The beneficiary requests that the county determine whether he or she is eligible for Medi-Cal benefits on a basis that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods.
(e) (1) For purposes of acquiring information necessary to conduct the eligibility redeterminations described in this section, a county shall gather information available to the county that is relevant to the beneficiary’s Medi-Cal eligibility prior to contacting the beneficiary. Sources for these efforts shall include information contained in the beneficiary’s file or other information, including more recent information available to the county, including, but not limited to, Medi-Cal, CalWORKs, and CalFresh case files of the beneficiary or of any of his or her immediate family members, which are open, or were closed within the last 90 days, information accessed through any databases accessed under Sections 435.948, 435.949, and 435.956 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and wherever feasible, other sources of relevant information reasonably available to the county or to the county via the department.
(2) In the case of an annual redetermination, if, based upon information obtained pursuant to paragraph (1), the county is able to make a determination of continued eligibility, the county shall notify the beneficiary of both of the following:
(A) The eligibility determination and the information it is based on.
(B) That the beneficiary is required to inform the county via the Internet, by telephone, by mail, in person, or through other commonly available electronic means, in counties where such electronic communication is available, if any information contained in the notice is inaccurate but that the beneficiary is not required to sign and return the notice if all information provided on the notice is accurate.
(3) The county shall make all reasonable efforts not to send multiple notices during the same time period about eligibility. The notice of eligibility renewal shall contain other related information such as if the beneficiary is in a new Medi-Cal program.
(4) In the case of a redetermination due to a change in circumstances, if a county determines that the change in circumstances does not affect the beneficiary’s eligibility status, the county shall not send the beneficiary a notice unless required to do so by federal law.
(f) (1) In the case of an annual eligibility redetermination, if the county is unable to determine continued eligibility based on the information obtained pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), the beneficiary shall be so informed and shall be provided with an annual renewal form, at least 60 days before the beneficiary’s annual redetermination date, that is prepopulated with information that the county has obtained and that identifies any additional information needed by the county to determine eligibility. The form shall include all of the following:
(A) The requirement that he or she provide any necessary information to the county within 60 days of the date that the form is sent to the beneficiary.
(B) That the beneficiary may respond to the county via the Internet, by mail, by telephone, in person, or through other commonly available electronic means if those means are available in that county.
(C) That if the beneficiary chooses to return the form to the county in person or via mail, the beneficiary shall sign the form in order for it to be considered complete.
(D) The telephone number to call in order to obtain more information.
(2) The county shall attempt to contact the beneficiary via the Internet, by telephone, or through other commonly available electronic means, if those means are available in that county, during the 60-day period after the prepopulated form is mailed to the beneficiary to collect the necessary information if the beneficiary has not responded to the request for additional information or has provided an incomplete response.
(3) If the beneficiary has not provided any response to the written request for information sent pursuant to paragraph (1) within 60 days from the date the form is sent, the county shall terminate his or her eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits following the provision of timely notice.
(4) If the beneficiary responds to the written request for information during the 60-day period pursuant to paragraph (1) but the information provided is not complete, the county shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) to work with the beneficiary to complete the information.
(5) (A) The form required by this subdivision shall be developed by the department in consultation with the counties and representatives of eligibility workers and consumers.
(B) For beneficiaries whose eligibility is not determined using MAGI-based financial methods, the county may use existing renewal forms until the state develops prepopulated renewal forms to provide to beneficiaries. The department shall develop prepopulated renewal forms for use with beneficiaries whose eligibility is not determined using MAGI-based financial methods by January 1, 2015.
(g) (1) In the case of a redetermination due to change in circumstances, if a county cannot obtain sufficient information to redetermine eligibility pursuant to subdivision (e), the county shall send to the beneficiary a form that is prepopulated with the information that the county has obtained and that states the information needed to renew eligibility. The county shall only request information related to the change in circumstances. The county shall not request information or documentation that has been previously provided by the beneficiary, that is not absolutely necessary to complete the eligibility determination, or that is not subject to change. The county shall only request information for nonapplicants necessary to make an eligibility determination or for a purpose directly related to the administration of the state Medicaid plan. The form shall advise the individual to provide any necessary information to the county via the Internet, by telephone, by mail, in person, or through other commonly available electronic means and, if the individual will provide the form by mail or in person, to sign the form. The form shall include a telephone number to call in order to obtain more information. The form shall be developed by the department in consultation with the counties, representatives of consumers, and eligibility workers. A Medi-Cal beneficiary shall have 30 days from the date the form is mailed pursuant to this subdivision to respond. Except as provided in paragraph (2), failure to respond prior to the end of this 30-day period shall not impact his or her Medi-Cal eligibility.
(2) If the purpose for a redetermination under this section is a loss of contact with the Medi-Cal beneficiary, as evidenced by the return of mail marked in such a way as to indicate that it could not be delivered to the intended recipient or that there was no forwarding address, a return of the form described in this subdivision marked as undeliverable shall result in an immediate notice of action terminating Medi-Cal eligibility.
(3) During the 30-day period after the date of mailing of a form to the Medi-Cal beneficiary pursuant to this subdivision, the county shall attempt to contact the beneficiary by telephone, in writing, or other commonly available electronic means, in counties where such electronic communication is available, to request the necessary information if the beneficiary has not responded to the request for additional information or has provided an incomplete response. If the beneficiary does not supply the necessary information to the county within the 30-day limit, a 10-day notice of termination of Medi-Cal eligibility shall be sent.
(h) Beneficiaries shall be required to report any change in circumstances that may affect their eligibility within 10 calendar days following the date the change occurred.
(i) If within 90 days of termination of a Medi-Cal beneficiary’s eligibility or a change in eligibility status pursuant to this section, the beneficiary submits to the county a signed and completed form or otherwise provides the needed information to the county, eligibility shall be redetermined by the county and if the beneficiary is found eligible, or the beneficiary’s eligibility status has not changed, whichever applies, the termination shall be rescinded as though the form were submitted in a timely manner.
(j) If the information available to the county pursuant to the redetermination procedures of this section does not indicate a basis of eligibility, Medi-Cal benefits may be terminated so long as due process requirements have otherwise been met.
(k) The department shall, with the counties and representatives of consumers, including those with disabilities, and Medi-Cal eligibility workers, develop a timeframe for redetermination of Medi-Cal eligibility based upon disability, including ex parte review, the redetermination forms described in subdivisions (f) and (g), timeframes for responding to county or state requests for additional information, and the forms and procedures to be used. The forms and procedures shall be as consumer-friendly as possible for people with disabilities. The timeframe shall provide a reasonable and adequate opportunity for the Medi-Cal beneficiary to obtain and submit medical records and other information needed to establish eligibility for Medi-Cal based upon disability.
(l) The county shall consider blindness as continuing until the reviewing physician determines that a beneficiary’s vision has improved beyond the applicable definition of blindness contained in the plan.
(m) The county shall consider disability as continuing until the review team determines that a beneficiary’s disability no longer meets the applicable definition of disability contained in the plan.
(n) In the case of a redetermination due to a change in circumstances, if a county determines that the beneficiary remains eligible for Medi-Cal benefits, the county shall begin a new 12-month eligibility period.
(o) (1) For individuals determined ineligible for Medi-Cal by a county following the redetermination procedures set forth in this section, the county shall determine eligibility for other insurance affordability programs and if the individual is found to be eligible, the county shall, as appropriate, transfer the individual’s electronic account to other insurance affordability programs via a secure electronic interface.
(2) If the individual is eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan through the California Health Benefit Exchange established pursuant to Title 22 (commencing with Section 100500) of the Government Code, Medi-Cal benefits shall not be terminated until at least 20 days after the county sends the notice of action terminating Medi-Cal eligibility. The notice of action shall inform the individual of the date by which he or she must select and enroll in a qualified health plan through the Exchange to avoid being uninsured. This paragraph shall only be implemented to the extent that federal financial participation is available.
(p) Any renewal form or notice shall be accessible to persons who are limited-English proficient and persons with disabilities consistent with all federal and state requirements.
(q) The requirements to provide information in subdivisions (e) and (g), and to report changes in circumstances in subdivision (h), may be provided through any of the modes of submission allowed in Section 435.907(a) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, including an Internet Web site identified by the department, telephone, mail, in person, and other commonly available electronic means as authorized by the department.
(r) Forms required to be signed by a beneficiary pursuant to this section shall be signed under penalty of perjury. Electronic signatures, telephonic signatures, and handwritten signatures transmitted by electronic transmission shall be accepted.
(s) For purposes of this section, “MAGI-based financial methods” means income calculated using the financial methodologies described in Section 1396a(e)(14) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and as added by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), as amended by the federal Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), and any subsequent amendments.
(t) When contacting a beneficiary under paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (f), and paragraph (3) of subdivision (g), a county shall first attempt to use the method of contact identified by the beneficiary as the preferred method of contact, if a method has been identified.
(u) The department shall seek federal approval to extend the annual redetermination date under this section for a three-month period for those Medi-Cal beneficiaries whose annual redeterminations are scheduled to occur between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2014.
(v) Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department, without taking any further regulatory action, shall implement, interpret, or make specific this section by means of all-county letters, plan letters, plan or provider bulletins, or similar instructions until the time regulations are adopted. The department shall adopt regulations by July 1, 2017, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. Beginning six months after the effective date of this section, and notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the department shall provide a status report to the Legislature on a semiannual basis, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, until regulations have been adopted.
(w) This section shall be implemented only if and to the extent that federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals have been obtained.
SEC. 3.
Section 15927 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, immediately following Section 15926, to read:
15927.
(a) If an individual who has been enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange is determined newly eligible for Medi-Cal through the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment and Retention System (CalHEERS) developed under Section 15926, the individual’s case information and eligibility determination shall be referred to his or her county of residence within three business days.
(b) (1) If the referral indicates that an individual is eligible or conditionally eligible for MAGI Medi-Cal, the county shall prioritize the referral for processing to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective according to either of the following timelines, as applicable:
(A) If the referral is received with at least five business days remaining in the month, the county shall prioritize the referral for processing to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective on the first day of the following month.
(B) If the referral is received with less than five business days remaining in the month, the county shall prioritize the referral for processing to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective no later than the first day of the second month following receipt of the referral.
(2) If the referral requires follow-up to establish Medi-Cal eligibility, the county shall prioritize the referral for processing to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective no later than the first day of the second month following receipt of the referral.
SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes various programs to provide health care coverage to persons with limited financial resources, including the Medi-Cal program and the state’s children’s health insurance program (CHIP). Existing law establishes the California Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange), pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and specifies the duties and powers of the board governing the Exchange relative to determining eligibility for enrollment in the Exchange and arranging for coverage under qualified health plans through the Exchange.
Existing law, the Health Care Reform Eligibility, Enrollment, and Retention Planning Act, requires an individual to have the option to apply for insurance affordability programs in person, by mail, online, by telephone, or by other commonly available electronic means. Existing law defines “insurance affordability programs” to include the Medi-Cal program, CHIP, and a program that makes available to qualified individuals coverage in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange with advance payment of the premium tax credit established under a specified provision of the Internal Revenue Code and a cost-sharing reduction under a specified provision of federal law. During the processing of an application, renewal, or a transition due to a change in circumstances, existing law requires an entity making eligibility determinations for an insurance affordability program to ensure that an eligible applicant and recipient of those programs that meets all program eligibility requirements and complies with all necessary requirements for information moves between programs without any breaks in coverage and without being required to provide any forms, documents, or other information or undergo verification that is duplicative or otherwise unnecessary.
This bill would establish procedures to ensure that eligible recipients of insurance affordability programs move between the Medi-Cal program and other insurance affordability programs without any breaks in coverage as required under the provision described above. The bill would require an individual’s case information and eligibility determination to be referred to his or her county of residence within 3 business days if the individual who has been enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange is determined newly eligible for Medi-Cal through the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment and Retention System (CalHEERS). The bill would require those referrals to be processed by the county, as specified, to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective pursuant to specified timelines.
The bill would generally prohibit, if an individual is eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan through the Exchange, Medi-Cal benefits from being terminated until at least 20 days after the county sends the notice of action terminating Medi-Cal eligibility, and would require the notice of action to inform the individual of the date by which he or she must select and enroll in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange, as specified. The bill would provide that this provision shall only be implemented to the extent that federal financial participation is available.
By modifying the enrollment process under the Medi-Cal program, thereby increasing the responsibilities of counties in the administration of the Medi-Cal program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 14005.37 of, and to add Section 15927 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public health."

(2) For the purposes of sentencing under this subdivision, each contact shall constitute a separate violation of this subdivision.

(4) A second or subsequent conviction for a violation of an order described in paragraph (1) occurring within seven years of a prior conviction for a violation of any of those orders and involving an act of violence or “a credible threat” of violence, as provided in subdivision (c) of Section 139, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or two or three years.
(5) The prosecuting agency of each county shall have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of the orders described in paragraph (1).
(d) (1) A person who owns, possesses, purchases, or receives a firearm knowing he or she is prohibited from doing so by the provisions of a protective order as defined in Section 136.2 of this code, Section 6218 of the Family Code, or Section 527.6 or 527.8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, shall be punished under Section 29825.

(2) If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of subdivision (c), the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one or both of the following requirements:
(A) That the defendant make payments to a battered women’s shelter, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).

(3) For an order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women’s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under this subdivision or subdivision (c), the court shall make a determination of the defendant’s ability to pay. In no event shall an order to make payments to a battered women’s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support.
(4) If the injury to a married person is caused in whole, or in part, by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of subdivision (c), the community property shall not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents required by this subdivision, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.
(5) A person violating an order described in subdivision (c) may be punished for any substantive offenses described under Section 136.1 or 646.9.

SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law generally punishes the willful disobedience of the terms of a court order as contempt of court by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding 6 months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both that imprisonment and fine. Existing law makes the willful and knowing violation of specified protective orders or stay-away court orders punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine for a first offense, and makes a 2nd or subsequent conviction for a violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders occurring within 7 years of a prior conviction and involving an act of violence or credible threat of violence punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. If probation is granted upon conviction of a willful and knowing violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders, existing law requires the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements.
Under existing law, any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a spouse or former spouse, cohabitant or former cohabitant, fiancé or fiancée, or someone with whom the offender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship, or the mother or father of the offender’s child, is guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor. Upon a conviction, existing law allows the sentencing court to issue an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim for up to 10 years.
This bill would make a violation of the above protective order issued for the conviction of inflicting a corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine. The bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation occurring within 7 years involving an act of violence or a credible threat of violence punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor. If probation is granted for a violation of these protective orders, this bill would require the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements. By increasing the punishment for a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 166 of the Penal Code, relating to crimes."

1367.255.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a health care service plan is not required to include abortion as a covered benefit.

(e)(1)All services shall be readily available at reasonable times to each enrollee consistent with good professional practice. To the extent feasible, the plan shall make all services readily accessible to all enrollees consistent with Section 1367.03.
(2)To the extent that telehealth services are appropriately provided through telehealth, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code, these services shall be considered in determining compliance with Section 1300.67.2 of Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations.
(3)The plan shall make all services accessible and appropriate consistent with Section 1367.04.
(f)The plan shall employ and utilize allied health manpower for the furnishing of services to the extent permitted by law and consistent with good medical practice.

(h)(1)Contracts with subscribers and enrollees, including group contracts, and contracts with providers, and other persons furnishing services, equipment, or facilities to, or in connection with, the plan, shall be fair, reasonable, and consistent with the objectives of this chapter. All contracts with providers shall contain provisions requiring a fast, fair, and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism under which providers may submit disputes to the plan, and requiring the plan to inform its providers upon contracting with the plan or upon change to these provisions, of the procedures for processing and resolving disputes, including the location and telephone number where information regarding disputes may be submitted.
(2)A health care service plan shall ensure that a dispute resolution mechanism is accessible to noncontracting providers for the purpose of resolving billing and claims disputes.
(3)A health care service plan shall annually submit a report to the department regarding its dispute resolution mechanism. The report shall include information on the number of providers who utilized the dispute resolution mechanism and a summary of the disposition of those disputes.
(i)A health care service plan contract shall provide to subscribers and enrollees all of the basic health care services included in subdivision (b) of Section 1345, except that the director may, for good cause, by rule or order exempt a plan contract or any class of plan contracts from that requirement. The director shall by rule define the scope of each basic health care service that health care service plans are required to provide as a minimum for licensure under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a health care service plan from charging subscribers or enrollees a copayment or a deductible for a basic health care service consistent with Section 1367.006 or 1367.007, provided that the copayments, deductibles, or other cost sharing are reported to the director and set forth to the subscriber or enrollee pursuant to the disclosure provisions of Section 1363. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a health care service plan from setting forth, by contract, limitations on maximum coverage of basic health care services, provided that the limitations are reported to, and held unobjectionable by, the director and set forth to the subscriber or enrollee pursuant to the disclosure provisions of Section 1363.
(j)(1)A health care service plan shall not require registration under the federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 801 et seq.) as a condition for participation by an optometrist certified to use therapeutic pharmaceutical agents pursuant to Section 3041.3 of the Business and Professions Code.
(2)This section shall not be construed to permit the director to establish the rates charged subscribers and enrollees for contractual health care services.
(3)The director’s enforcement of Article 3.1 (commencing with Section 1357) shall not be deemed to establish the rates charged subscribers and enrollees for contractual health care services.
(4)The obligation of the plan to comply with this chapter shall not be waived when the plan delegates services that it is required to perform to its medical groups, independent practice associations, or other contracting entities.","Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care.

(e) Written and oral information pertaining to the child's death as requested by a child death review team may be disclosed to a child death review team established pursuant to this section. The team may make a request, in writing, for the information sought and any person with information of the kind described in paragraph (2) may rely on the request in determining whether information may be disclosed to the team.
(1) An individual or agency that has information governed by this subdivision shall not be required to disclose information. The intent of this subdivision is to allow the voluntary disclosure of information by the individual or agency that has the information.
(2) The following information may be disclosed pursuant to this subdivision:
(A) Notwithstanding Section 56.10 of the Civil Code, medical information, unless disclosure is prohibited by federal law.

The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 11174.32 of the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to facilitate the voluntary disclosure of confidential information to child death review teams and to retain the confidentiality of that information, the limitations on the public’s right of access imposed by Section 1 of this act are necessary.","Existing law authorizes a county to establish an interagency child death review team to assist local agencies in identifying and reviewing suspicious child deaths and facilitating communication among persons who perform autopsies and the various persons and agencies involved in child abuse or neglect cases. Existing law requires records that are exempt from disclosure to 3rd parties pursuant to state or federal law to remain exempt from disclosure when they are in the possession of a child death review team.
This bill would authorize the voluntary disclosure of specified information, including mental health records, criminal history information, and child abuse reports, by an individual or agency to an interagency child death review team. The bill would provide that written or oral information disclosed to a child death review team pursuant to these provisions would remain confidential, and would not be subject to disclosure or discovery by a 3rd party unless otherwise required by law.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to amend Section 11174.32 of the Penal Code, relating to crime."

(c) Funding shall be allocated by the Controller consistent with the requirements of this part and with Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code, upon a determination by the Department of Transportation that the expenditures proposed by a transit agency meet the requirements of this part and guidelines developed pursuant to subdivision (f), and that the amount of funding requested is currently available.
(d) (1) Moneys for the program shall be expended to provide transit operating or capital assistance that meets all of the following criteria:
(A) Expenditures supporting new or expanded bus or rail services, new or expanded water-borne transit, or expanded intermodal transit facilities, and may include equipment acquisition, fueling, and maintenance, and other costs to operate those services or facilities.
(B) The recipient transit agency demonstrates that each expenditure directly enhances or expands transit service to increase mode share.
(C) The recipient transit agency demonstrates that each expenditure reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
(2) (A) Moneys for the program may additionally be expended to support the operation of existing bus or rail service if all of the following occur:
(i) The governing board of the transit agency declares a fiscal emergency, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 21080.32, within 90 days prior to the agency requesting the funds.
(ii) The expenditure of the requested funds is necessary to sustain the transit agency’s transit service in the fiscal year in which the requested funds are to be expended.
(iii) The governing board of the transit agency would be required to reduce or eliminate transit service if the requested funds are not received.
(iv) The governing board makes a finding that a reduction in, or elimination of, transit service would increase greenhouse gas emissions because transit customers would choose other less-efficient modes of transportation.
(v) The transit agency does not request funds over consecutive funding years unless the transit agency has declared a fiscal emergency in each year consistent with clause (i).
(vi) The transit agency does not request funds for more than three consecutive funding years.

(a) The electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system has operated statewide in California since 2004 as an effective and efficient method to issue government benefits to recipients.
(b) Research has shown that the use of EBT has many advantages for delivering public benefits. For recipients, EBT offers greater convenience, improved security, and reduced stigmatization. For state governments, EBT provides cost and time savings, improves operational efficiencies, and promotes accountability while stimulating local economies.
(c) EBT has been deemed an effective and responsive mechanism for quickly delivering assistance to people recovering from natural disasters.
(d) The Legislature and the Governor established The Human Right to Water in 2013, which established the policy of California that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.
(e) Despite a history of proactive water policies, California residents still face formidable challenges as the drought continues to exacerbate water quality issues for disadvantaged communities who disproportionately bear the health and financial impacts of inadequate access to safe water.
(f) Significant barriers to water access exist for marginalized Californians who are forced to choose between drinking water and expending scarce resources to pay for clean water.
(g) In 2014, more than 1 million Californians faced water safety violations that made water unsafe to drink.
(h) As the drought enters its fifth year, more than 2,000 domestic wells have gone dry in the Central Valley, affecting tens of thousands of people. Many small communities face chronic water quality problems. Almost 400 small rural water systems and schools are unable to provide safe drinking water.
(i) In response to these challenges, the Governor and the Legislature have established or proposed new emergency drinking water supports to assist these households.
(j) Recognizing this, it is the intent of the Legislature
to utilize the existing EBT system
to deliver appropriate emergency water benefits to disadvantaged households in an efficient and effective
manner.

Each Individual Tribal Casino Account shall be funded in proportion to the amount that each individual tribe paid in the prior fiscal year to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund.
(b) (1) There is hereby created in each county in which Indian gaming is conducted an Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. The selection of all grants from each Individual Tribal Casino Account or County Tribal Casino Account shall be made by each county’s Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. In selecting grants, the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee shall follow the priorities established in subdivision (g) and the requirements specified in subdivision (h). This committee has the following additional responsibilities:
(A) Establishing all application policies and procedures for grants from the Individual Tribal Casino Account or County Tribal Casino Account. Each grant application shall clearly show how the grant will mitigate the impact of the casino on the grant applicant.
(B) Assessing the eligibility of applications for grants from local jurisdictions impacted by tribal gaming operations.

When there are no cities within four miles of a tribal casino in the county, and when the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee acts on behalf of a county where no tribes pay into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, other local representatives may be selected upon mutual agreement by the county board of supervisors and a majority of the tribes operating casinos in the county. However, if only one city is within four miles of a tribal casino and that same casino is located entirely within the unincorporated area of that particular county, only one elected representative from that city shall be included on the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee.
(C) Two representatives selected upon the recommendation of a majority of the tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in each county. When an Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee acts on behalf of a county

Any existing Conflict of Interest Code shall be reviewed and amended as necessary to bring it into compliance with the requirements of Article 3 (commencing with Section 87300) of Chapter 7 of Title 9.
(c) Sixty percent of each Individual Tribal Casino Account shall be available for nexus grants on a yearly basis to cities and counties impacted by tribes that are paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, according to the four-part nexus test described in paragraph (1). Grant awards shall be selected by each county’s Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and shall be administered by the county. Grants may be awarded on a multiyear basis, and these multiyear grants shall be accounted for in the grant process for each year.

(A) Whether the local government jurisdiction borders the Indian lands on all sides.
(B) Whether the local government jurisdiction partially borders Indian lands.
(C) Whether the local government jurisdiction maintains a highway, road, or other thoroughfare that is the predominant access route to a casino that is located within four miles.
(D) Whether all or a portion of the local government jurisdiction is located within four miles of a casino.
(2) Fifty percent of the amount specified in
this

If a local jurisdiction approves an expenditure that mitigates an impact from a casino on a local jurisdiction and that also provides other benefits to the local jurisdiction, the grant selected pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be used to finance only the proportionate share of the expenditure that mitigates the impact from the casino.
(i) All grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts shall be made only upon the affirmative sponsorship of the tribe paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund from whose Individual Tribal Casino Account the grant moneys are available for distribution. Tribal sponsorship shall confirm that the grant application has a reasonable relationship to a casino impact and satisfies at least one of the priorities listed in subdivision (g). A grant may not be made for any purpose that would support or fund, directly or indirectly, any effort related to the opposition or challenge to Indian gaming in the state, and, to the extent any awarded grant is utilized for any prohibited purpose by any local government, upon notice given to the county by any tribe from whose Individual Tribal Casino Account the awarded grant went toward that prohibited use, the grant shall terminate immediately and any moneys not yet used shall again be made available for qualified nexus grants.

If any portion of the funds in the account is used for any other purpose, the remaining portion shall revert to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. As a condition of receiving further funds under this section, a local government jurisdiction, upon request of the county, shall demonstrate to the county that all expenditures made from the account have been in compliance with the requirements of this section.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California.","Existing law creates in the State Treasury the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund for the receipt and deposit of moneys received by the state from certain Indian tribes pursuant to the terms of gaming compacts entered into with the state. Existing law authorizes moneys in that fund to be used for specified purposes, including for grants for the support of state and local government agencies impacted by tribal government gaming. Existing law, until January 1, 2021, creates a County Tribal Casino Account in the treasury of each county that contains a tribal casino, which is funded according to specified formulas. Existing law requires the Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, to divide the County Tribal Casino Account for each county that has gaming devices that are subject to an obligation to make contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund into a separate account, known as an Individual Tribal Casino Account, for each tribe that operates a casino within the county. Each Individual Tribal Casino Account is required to be funded in proportion to the amount that each individual tribe paid in the prior fiscal year to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, and authorizes funds in these accounts to be released to make grants to local agencies impacted by tribal casinos, as specified. Existing law establishes an Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee in each county in which gaming is conducted, specifies the composition and responsibilities of that committee, and requires that committee to make the selection of grants from those casino accounts. Among other things, the committee is responsible for establishing all application policies and procedures for grants from the casino accounts.
Existing law requires every state agency and local government agency to adopt and promulgate a Conflict of Interest Code applicable to enumerated positions within the agency and designated employees, as specified.
This bill would require each Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee to adopt and approve a Conflict of Interest Code pursuant to these provisions. The bill would require any existing Conflict of Interest Code to be reviewed and amended as necessary to bring it into compliance with these requirements. By increasing the duties of local government entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, provides for the negotiation and execution of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of authorizing certain types of gaming on Indian lands within a state. The California Constitution authorizes the Governor to negotiate and conclude compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature. Existing law ratifies a number of tribal-state gaming compacts between the State of California and specified Indian tribes.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California.","An act
to amend Section 12715 of the Government Code,
relating to gaming."

The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Many local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, and community college
districts
districts,
have experienced rapid increases in energy costs due to energy rate increases approved by the Public Utilities Commission.
(b) Local educational agencies are disproportionately affected by rapid increases in energy costs and differ from other public agencies because they are strictly limited in their ability to raise local tax revenues to cover operational cost increases. Local educational agencies seeking to participate in Public Utilities Commission proceedings must hire attorneys and experts at their own expense, using the state and local dollars that were designated for educational programs.
(c) The cost of intervening in Public Utilities Commission proceedings is often prohibitive for local educational agencies; therefore, the perspectives of local educational agencies are often lost during proceedings to discuss rate changes.
(d) The Public Utilities Commission’s Intervenor Compensation Program is intended to ensure that individuals and groups that represent residential or small commercial electric utility customers have the financial resources to bring their concerns and interests to the commission during formal proceedings.
(e) As a regional agency, a county office of education is the appropriate intervenor in a proceeding affecting any local educational agency in whole or part within the county.
SEC. 2.
Section 1802 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:

(A) A participant representing consumers, customers, or subscribers of any electrical, gas, telephone, telegraph, or water corporation that is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
(B) A representative who has been authorized by a customer.

(II) A representative of a consortium of public school districts or agencies participating or intervening pursuant to this article in a commission proceeding shall not have had a direct financial interest in the resolution of the commission proceeding within the two years preceding the filing of comments with the commission, and shall not have a direct financial interest in the resolution of the proceeding sooner than two years after that resolution.

(h) “Small commercial customer” means
any
a
nonresidential customer with a maximum peak demand of less than 50 kilowatts. The commission may establish rules to modify or change the definition of “small commercial customer,” including use of criteria other than a peak demand threshold, if the commission determines that the modification or change will promote participation in proceedings at the commission by organizations representing small businesses, without incorporating large commercial and industrial customers.
(i) “Substantial contribution” means that, in the judgment of the commission, the customer’s presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions, legal contentions, or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer.

If
the customer’s participation has resulted in a substantial contribution, even if the decision adopts that customer’s contention or recommendations only in part, the commission may award the customer compensation for all reasonable advocate’s fees, reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has broad regulatory authority pursuant to the California Constitution and the Public Utilities Act over public utilities, as defined.

(a) The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program is hereby established for the purpose of recruiting classified school employees to participate in a program designed to encourage them to enroll in teacher training programs and to provide instructional service as teachers in the public schools.
(b) Subject to an appropriation for these purposes in the annual Budget Act, the commission shall issue a request for proposals to all school districts and county offices of education in the state in order to solicit applications for funding. The criteria adopted by the commission for the selection of school districts or county offices of education to participate in the program shall include all of the following:
(1) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates the capacity and willingness to accommodate the participation of classified school employees in teacher training programs conducted at institutions of higher education.
(2) The extent to which the applicant’s plan for the implementation of its recruitment program involves the active participation of one or more local campuses of the participating institutions of higher education in the development of coursework and teaching programs for participating classified school employees. Each selected applicant shall be required to enter into a written articulation agreement with the participating campuses of the institutions of higher education.
(3) The extent to which the applicant’s plan for recruitment attempts to meet the demand of teacher shortages in shortage areas in
kindergarten
transitional kindergarten, kindergarten,
and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Each classified school employee selected to participate shall have
successfully
completed at least two years of undergraduate college or university coursework and shall have demonstrated an interest in obtaining a multiple subject or single subject teaching credential.
(4) The extent to which a developmentally sequenced series of job descriptions leads from an entry-level classified school employee position to an entry-level teaching position in that school district or county office of education.
(5) The extent to which the applicant’s plan for recruitment attempts to meet its own specific teacher needs.
(c) An applicant that is selected to participate pursuant to subdivision (b) shall provide information about the program to all eligible classified school employees in the school district or county office of education and assistance to each classified school employee it recruits under the program regarding admission to a teacher training program.
(d) (1) An applicant shall require participants to satisfy
all
both
of the following requirements before participating in the program:
(A) Pass a criminal background check.
(B) Provide verification of one of the following:
(i) Has earned an associate or higher level degree.
(ii) Has
successfully
completed at least two years of study at a postsecondary educational institution.
(2) An applicant shall certify that it has received a commitment from each participant that he or she will accomplish all of the following:
(A) Graduate from an institution of higher education under the program with a bachelor’s degree.
(B) Complete all of the requirements for, and obtain, a multiple subject, single subject, or education specialist teaching credential.
(C) Complete one school year of classroom instruction in the school district or county office of education for each year that he or she receives assistance for books, fees, and tuition while attending an institution of higher education under the program.
(e) The commission shall contract with an independent evaluator with a proven record of experience in assessing teacher training programs to conduct an evaluation to determine the success of the program. The evaluation shall be conducted once every five years, with the first evaluation being completed on or before July 1, 2021. The commission shall submit the completed evaluation to the Governor and the education policy and fiscal committees of the Assembly and Senate.
(f) On or before January 1 of each year, the commission shall report to the Legislature regarding the status of the program, including, but not limited to, the number of classified school employees recruited, the academic progress of the classified school employees recruited, the number of classified school employees recruited who are subsequently employed as teachers in the public schools, the degree to which the applicant meets the teacher shortage needs of the school district or county office of education, and the ethnic and racial composition of the participants in the program. The report shall be made in conformance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature
that
that,
each fiscal year, funding for the California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program be allocated to the commission for grants for up to 1,000 new participants per year. A grant to an applicant shall not exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000) per participant per year. Funding for grants to applicants shall be contingent upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act.","The Wildman-Keeley-Solis Exemplary Teacher Training Act of 1997 establishes the California School Paraprofessional Teacher Training Program for the purpose of recruiting paraprofessionals to participate in a program designed to encourage them to enroll in teacher training programs and to provide instructional service as teachers in the public schools. The act requires, among other things, that the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, in consultation with certain other educational entities,
to
select, pursuant to specified criteria, 24 or more school districts or county offices of education representing rural, urban, and suburban areas that apply to participate in the program. The act requires a school district or county office of education to require a person participating in the program to commit to fulfilling certain specified obligations relating to obtaining a teaching credential and employment as a teacher in the school district or county office of education. The act requires a school district or county office of education to require a program participant to obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission and provide verification of a specified level of academic achievement prior to participating in the program. The act expresses the intent of the Legislature
that
that,
in each fiscal year, funding for the California School Paraprofessional Teacher Training Program be allocated to the commission for grants to school districts and county offices of education, limits grants to $3,500 per program participant per year, and makes funding for the grants contingent upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would substantially revise those provisions to instead establish the California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program for the

and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. The bill would require an applicant that is selected to participate to provide information about the program to all eligible classified school employees in the school district or county office of education and to provide assistance to each classified school employee it recruits under the program regarding admission to a teacher training program. The bill would also require an applicant to require participants to satisfy specified requirements before participating in the program, including passing a background check, and to certify that it has received a commitment from each participant that he or she will accomplish certain things, including completing all of the requirements for, and obtain, a multiple subject, single subject, or education specialist teaching credential. The bill would require the commission to contract with an independent evaluator with a proven record of experience in assessing teacher training programs to conduct an evaluation to determine the success of the program and would require the evaluation to be conducted once every 5 years, with the first evaluation being completed on or before July 1, 2021. The bill would also require the commission, on or before January 1 of each year, to report to the Legislature regarding the status of the program, as specified. The bill would state the Legislature’s intent
that
that,
each fiscal year, funding for the program be allocated to the commission for grants for up to 1,000 new participants per year and would prohibit a grant to an applicant from exceeding $4,000 per participant per year.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Beauty care workers, including cosmetologists and manicurists, are highly exposed to the potential harm of carcinogens and reproductive toxins in cosmetics. Cosmetologists and manicurists are predominantly women and minorities.
(b) Nail services are increasing in popularity among consumers. The money consumers spent in nail salons increased from $7.3 billion in 2012 to $8.54 billion in 2014.
(c) Chemicals in professional cosmetics can be harmful to salon customers, who increasingly include prepubescent girls and young women.
(d) Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can cause harm at very low levels. Some may enter the body through the skin or cuticle.
(e) Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), included in nail polish to reduce brittleness and cracking, is a reproductive and developmental toxicant that is especially harmful to pregnant women.
(f) Developmental toxicants interfere with proper growth or health of a child, acting at any point from conception to puberty.
(g) Toluene, a solvent found in nail polish, is a developmental and neurological toxicant that causes headaches, dizziness, and nausea, among other symptoms.
(h) Formaldehyde, a chemical that acts as a disinfectant and as a preservative in nail polishes, is a known carcinogen. Exposure to formaldehyde in the short term can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, and skin, and in the long term exposure can cause asthma.
(i) A number of cosmetic product manufacturers, including both small domestic producers and large multinational corporations, have eliminated certain substances that cause cancer or reproductive harm from their products.
(j) Some local governments have already adopted successful Healthy Nail Salon Recognition Programs (HNSR programs), including the City and County of San Francisco, the Counties of Alameda, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, and the City of Santa Monica.
(k) These local HNSR programs support nail salons that use less toxic products and practices that are safer for workers and their customers.
(l) Given the recently enacted successful local HNSR programs, and the availability of safer alternative cosmetic products, it is in the interest of the people of the State of California to ensure that nail salons are given guidelines to operate safely for workers and consumers.

(e) In collaboration with existing healthy nail salon programs, the department shall promote the HNSR guidelines developed pursuant to subdivision (a) by doing all of the following:
(1) Developing and implementing a consumer education program.
(2) Presenting the HNSR guidelines to local health officers, local environmental health departments, and other local agencies as appropriate.
(3) Developing and either distributing or posting on its Internet Web site information for local entities, including, but not limited to, suggestions for successful implementation of HNSR programs and resource lists that include names and contact information of vendors, consultants, or providers of financial assistance or loans for purchases of ventilation equipment.","Existing law regulates the existence and disclosure of specified chemicals and components in consumer products, including phthalates and bisphenol A.

1203.
(a) As used in this code, “probation” means the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of conditional and revocable release in the community under the supervision of a probation officer. As used in this code, “conditional sentence” means the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of revocable release in the community subject to conditions established by the court without the supervision of a probation officer. It is the intent of the Legislature that both conditional sentence and probation are authorized whenever probation is authorized in any code as a sentencing option for infractions or misdemeanors.
(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (j), if a person is convicted of a felony and is eligible for probation, before judgment is pronounced, the court shall immediately refer the matter to a probation officer to investigate and report to the court, at a specified time, upon the circumstances surrounding the crime and the prior history and record of the person, which may be considered either in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment.
(2) (A) The probation officer shall immediately investigate and make a written report to the court of his or her findings and recommendations, including his or her recommendations as to the granting or denying of probation and the conditions of probation, if granted.
(B) Pursuant to Section 828 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the probation officer shall include in his or her report any information gathered by a law enforcement agency relating to the taking of the defendant into custody as a minor, which shall be considered for purposes of determining whether adjudications of commissions of crimes as a juvenile warrant a finding that there are circumstances in aggravation pursuant to Section 1170 or to deny probation.
(C) If the person was convicted of an offense that requires him or her to register as a sex offender pursuant to Sections 290 to 290.023, inclusive, or if the probation report recommends that registration be ordered at sentencing pursuant to Section 290.006, the probation officer’s report shall include the results of the State-Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders (SARATSO) administered pursuant to Sections 290.04 to 290.06, inclusive, if applicable.
(D) The probation officer may also include in the report his or her recommendation of both of the following:
(i) The amount the defendant should be required to pay as a restitution fine pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4.
(ii) Whether the court shall require, as a condition of probation, restitution to the victim or to the Restitution Fund and the amount thereof.
(E) The report shall be made available to the court and the prosecuting and defense attorneys at least five days, or upon request of the defendant or prosecuting attorney nine days, prior to the time fixed by the court for the hearing and determination of the report, and shall be filed with the clerk of the court as a record in the case at the time of the hearing. The time within which the report shall be made available and filed may be waived by written stipulation of the prosecuting and defense attorneys that is filed with the court or an oral stipulation in open court that is made and entered upon the minutes of the court.
A request for a continuance of the hearing based on a failure to make the report available to the parties within the deadlines specified in this paragraph may be granted by the court only upon a finding of good cause.
(3) At a time fixed by the court, the court shall hear and determine the application, if one has been made, or, in any case, the suitability of probation in the particular case. At the hearing, the court shall consider any report of the probation officer, including the results of the SARATSO, if applicable, and shall make a statement that it has considered the report, which shall be filed with the clerk of the court as a record in the case. If the court determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed by law or that the ends of justice would be served by granting probation to the person, it may place the person on probation. If probation is denied, the clerk of the court shall immediately send a copy of the report to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at the prison or other institution to which the person is delivered.
(4) The preparation of the report or the consideration of the report by the court may be waived only by a written stipulation of the prosecuting and defense attorneys that is filed with the court or an oral stipulation in open court that is made and entered upon the minutes of the court, except that a waiver shall not be allowed unless the court consents thereto. However, if the defendant is ultimately sentenced and committed to the state prison, a probation report shall be completed pursuant to Section 1203c.
(c) If a defendant is not represented by an attorney, the court shall order the probation officer who makes the probation report to discuss its contents with the defendant.
(d) If a person is convicted of a misdemeanor, the court may either refer the matter to the probation officer for an investigation and a report or summarily pronounce a conditional sentence.

If the case is not referred to the probation officer, in sentencing the person, the court may consider any information concerning the person that could have been included in a probation report. The court shall inform the person of the information to be considered and permit him or her to answer or controvert the information. For this purpose, upon the request of the person, the court shall grant a continuance before the judgment is pronounced.
(e) Except in unusual cases where the interests of justice would best be served if the person is granted probation, probation shall not be granted to any of the following persons:
(1) Unless the person had a lawful right to carry a deadly weapon, other than a firearm, at the time of the perpetration of the crime or his or her arrest, any person who has been convicted of arson, robbery, carjacking, burglary, burglary with explosives, rape with force or violence, torture, aggravated mayhem, murder, attempt to commit murder, trainwrecking, kidnapping, escape from the state prison, or a conspiracy to commit one or more of those crimes and who was armed with the weapon at either of those times.
(2) Any person who used, or attempted to use, a deadly weapon upon a human being in connection with the perpetration of the crime of which he or she has been convicted.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares both of the following:
(a) Improving occupational health and safety in all lines of work is a priority for the State of California, and that focus should extend to family child care providers. Improving health and safety for family child care providers will also protect the health and safety of the children under their care, because a safer and healthier environment for family child care providers means a safer and healthier environment for children.
(b) Family child care providers are at risk for occupational health and safety hazards on the job, including from toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards such as lifting and bending. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, child care workers have musculoskeletal injury rates comparable to those of industrial truck and tractor operators and construction equipment operators. Since family child care providers are not covered by workers’ compensation insurance, it is particularly important to them and to the children under their care that they be trained to avoid injury and illness on the job.
SEC. 2.
Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
1596.86.
(a) The director shall annually publish and make available to interested persons a list or lists covering all licensed child day care facilities, other than small family day care homes, and the services for which each facility has been licensed or issued a special permit. The lists shall also specify the licensed capacity of the facility and whether it is licensed by the department or by another public agency.
(b)  To encourage the recruitment of small family day care homes and protect their personal privacy, the department shall prevent the use of lists containing names,
addresses
addresses,
and other identifying information of facilities identified as small family day care homes, except as necessary for administering the licensing program, facilitating the placement of children in these facilities, and providing the names and addresses to resource and referral agencies funded by the State Department of Education, food and nutrition programs funded by the State Department of Education, alternative payment programs funded by the State Department of Education, county programs under the Greater Avenues for Independence Act of 1985 (Article 3.2 (commencing with Section 11320) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code),
the entity selected to provide the trainings required pursuant to Section 1596.864,
family day care organizations, or specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as contained in Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1340), which provide employee assistance program services that include child care referral services. Upon request, parents seeking local day care services may receive the names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers.
(c)  The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations relating to the confidentiality of information provided pursuant to subdivision (b) on small family day care homes. These regulations shall include procedures for updating lists or other information on small family day care providers to ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing with the department. Any person or entity violating the regulations under this subdivision may be denied access by the department to information on small family day care homes and shall be reported by the department to the appropriate funding or licensing department.

(2) “Publicly funded child care program” means a program to subsidize early learning and care for children that is administered by the State Department of Education, the State Department of Social Services, or another department, agency, or political subdivision of the state, including, but not limited to, child care voucher programs, contracted child care slots, the California State Preschool Program, and programs established subsequent to the passage of this section, but not including the K-12 public education system.
(b) A family child care provider shall attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and how to identify and avoid those risks to protect the provider’s own health and safety and the health and safety of the children in his or her care.
(c) The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule according to which all family child care providers shall be required to complete the training in no less than four years from when the training is first offered pursuant to this section, or within three months of the provider becoming a family child care provider, whichever occurs later.

(2) The entity selected to provide the training required by this section shall develop the curriculum for the training sessions with input from family child care providers. The curriculum shall be reviewed and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the Department of Industrial Relations.
(3) The State Department of Social Services shall administer the contract with the entity selected to provide the training.
(f) The training required by this section shall be coordinated, to the extent possible, with other preservice training requirements for family child care providers, and with resource and referral networks, so as to reduce the burden on providers.
(g) On a monthly basis, the department shall provide lists of the family child care providers who have attended the training and of those who are required to attend the training, but have not yet attended, and their contact information, to the entity selected to provide the training.

(c)The operation of this section is contingent upon the enactment of an appropriation for this purpose in the annual Budget Act or another statute.","Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to license and regulate family day care home providers and to regulate other nonlicensed persons who provide in-home child care. Violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill, as of July 1, 2017, would require a family child care provider, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and how to identify and avoid those risks to protect the provider’s own health and safety and the health and safety of the children in his or her care.

By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, requires the State Department of Education to contract with local contracting agencies for alternative payment programs that are intended to allow for maximum parental choice in child care.

SECTION 1.
Section 22659.7 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:
22659.7.
Notwithstanding any other law, a motor vehicle is a public nuisance subject to seizure by a local law enforcement agency and an impoundment period of up to 30 days when the motor vehicle is used in the commission or attempted commission of a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 647 of the Penal Code by a person buying or attempting to buy sexual services if the owner or operator of the vehicle has had a prior conviction for the same offense within the past three years. The vehicle may only be impounded pursuant to a valid arrest by a local law enforcement agency of the driver for a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 647 of the Penal Code for buying or attempting to buy sexual services. The following procedures shall apply:
(a) Within two working days after impoundment, the impounding agency shall send a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the legal owner of the vehicle, at the address obtained from the department, informing the owner that the vehicle has been impounded. The notice shall also include notice of the opportunity for a poststorage hearing to determine the validity of the storage or to determine mitigating circumstances establishing that the vehicle should be released. The impounding agency shall be prohibited from charging for more than five days’ storage if the agency fails to notify the legal owner within two working days after the impoundment when the legal owner redeems the impounded vehicle. The impounding agency shall maintain a published telephone number that provides information 24 hours a day regarding the impoundment of vehicles and the rights of a legal owner and a registered owner to request a hearing. The notice shall include all of the following information:
(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the agency providing the notice.
(2) The location of the place of storage and description of the vehicle that shall include, if available, the model or make, the manufacturer, the license plate number, and the mileage.
(3) The authority and purpose for the removal of the vehicle.

The public agency may authorize one of its own officers or employees to conduct the hearing if that hearing officer is not the same person who directed the seizure of the vehicle or who arrested the defendant.
(c) Failure of the legal and the registered owners, or their agents, to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall satisfy the poststorage hearing requirement.
(d) The agency employing the person who directed the storage of the vehicle shall be responsible for the costs incurred for towing and storage if it is determined in the poststorage hearing that reasonable grounds for the storage are not established.
(e) Any period during which a vehicle is subjected to storage pursuant to this section shall be included as part of the period of impoundment.
(f) The impounding agency shall release the vehicle to the registered owner or his or her agent prior to the end of the impoundment period under any of the following circumstances:
(1) The driver of the impounded vehicle was arrested without probable cause.
(2) The vehicle is a stolen vehicle.
(3) The vehicle is subject to bailment and was driven by an unlicensed driver employed by a business establishment, including a parking service or repair garage.

(6) A spouse, registered domestic partner, or other affected third party objects to the impoundment of the vehicle on the grounds that impounding the vehicle would create a hardship because the subject vehicle is the sole vehicle in a household. The hearing officer shall release the vehicle where the hardship to a spouse, registered domestic partner, or other affected third party created by the impoundment of the subject vehicle, or the length of the impoundment, outweigh the seriousness and the severity of the act in which the vehicle was used.

(h) Except as provided in subdivision (g), the registered owner or his or her agent shall be responsible for all towing and storage charges related to the impoundment.
(i) A vehicle removed and seized pursuant to this section shall be released to the legal owner of the vehicle or the legal owner’s agent prior to the end of the impoundment period if both of the following conditions are met:

(2) The legal owner or the legal owner’s agent pays all towing and storage fees related to the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle.
(j) (1) No lien sale processing fees shall be charged to the legal owner who redeems the vehicle prior to the 15th day of the impoundment period.

A credit card or debit card shall be in the name of the person presenting the card. For purposes of this section, “credit card” is as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1747.02 of the Civil Code. A credit card does not include a credit card issued by a retail seller.
(3) A person operating or in charge of a storage facility described in paragraph (2) who violates paragraph (2) shall be civilly liable to the owner of the vehicle or the person who tendered the fees for four times the amount of the towing, storage, and related fees, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500).

Any documents presented may be originals, photocopies, or facsimile copies or may be transmitted electronically. The law enforcement agency, impounding agency, or other governmental agency, or any person acting on behalf of those agencies, shall not require any documents to be notarized. The law enforcement agency, impounding agency, or any person acting on behalf of those agencies may require the agent of the legal owner to produce a photocopy or facsimile copy of its repossession agency license or registration issued pursuant to Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 7500) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, or to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the law enforcement agency, impounding agency, or any person acting on behalf of those agencies that the agent is exempt from licensure pursuant to Section 7500.2 or 7500.3 of the Business and Professions Code.
(2) Administrative costs authorized under subdivision (a) of Section 22850.5 shall not be charged to the legal owner of the type specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (i) who redeems the vehicle unless the legal owner voluntarily requests a poststorage hearing.

The legal owner or the legal owner’s agent shall be given a copy of any documents he or she is required to sign, except for a vehicle evidentiary hold log book. The law enforcement agency, impounding agency, or any person acting on behalf of those agencies, or any person in possession of the vehicle, may photocopy and retain the copies of any documents presented by the legal owner or legal owner’s agent. The legal owner shall indemnify and hold harmless a storage facility from any claims arising out of the release of the vehicle to the legal owner or the legal owner’s agent and from any damage to the vehicle after its release, including the reasonable costs associated with defending those claims.
(l) A legal owner, who meets the requirements for release of a vehicle pursuant to subdivision (i), or the legal owner’s agent, shall not be required to request a poststorage hearing as a requirement for release of the vehicle to the legal owner or the legal owner’s agent.
(m) (1)   A legal owner, who meets the requirements for release of a vehicle pursuant to subdivision (i), or the legal owner’s agent, shall not release the vehicle to the registered owner of the vehicle or an agent of the registered owner, unless the registered owner is a rental car agency, until after the termination of the impoundment period.
(2) Prior to relinquishing the vehicle, the legal owner may require the registered owner to pay all towing and storage charges related to the seizure and impoundment.
(n) (1)   A vehicle removed and seized pursuant to this section shall be released to a rental car agency prior to the end of the impoundment period if the agency is either the legal owner or registered owner of the vehicle and the agency pays all towing and storage fees related to the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle.
(2) The owner of a rental vehicle that was seized pursuant to this section may continue to rent the vehicle upon recovery of the vehicle.

Existing law requires the ordinance to include specified provisions related to notice, the payment of towing, storage, and administrative fees, the provision of a poststorage hearing, and the release of the impounded vehicle.
This bill would also provide that a vehicle used in the commission of a crime related to prostitution by a person buying or attempting to buy sexual services is a nuisance subject to an impoundment period of up to 30 days.

SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature that the state fully cooperate with the Federal Aviation Administration regarding the appropriate division of responsibility for the regulation of unmanned aircraft systems between the federal and state governments so that the state may reserve and fully exercise any and all appropriate authority pursuant to federal laws as they exist in their current form and as they may be further amended hereafter.

SEC. 5.
Article 4 (commencing with Section 5085) is added to Chapter 1.2 of Division 5 of the Public Resources Code, to read:
Article  4. Unmanned Aircraft Systems
5085.
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate an unmanned aircraft system in, or fly an unmanned aircraft system over, Department of Parks and Recreation managed lands or waters, except as authorized by the department, or unless otherwise exempted from this article.

SEC. 6.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil and public unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system. Existing law establishes both the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Parks and Recreation in the Natural Resources Agency. A violation of any rule or regulation made or adopted by the Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the Fish and Game Code is a misdemeanor. A violation of the rules and regulations established by the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect the state park system is punishable as either a misdemeanor or an infraction.
This bill would make it unlawful for any person to operate an unmanned aircraft system in, or fly an unmanned aircraft system over, lands or waters managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and Department of Parks and Recreation, except as authorized or unless exempted from this prohibition. The bill would authorize the consideration of certain factors when reviewing a request for authorization for the use of an unmanned aircraft system.
The bill would also make it unlawful to use an unmanned aircraft system to take, or assist in the take of, fish or wildlife for sport purposes, including, but not limited to, the use of unmanned aircraft systems for scouting purposes. The bill would provide that an unmanned aircraft system is a motorized air vehicle within the meaning of a certain existing prohibition and, thus, under that prohibition may not be used to pursue, drive, or herd any bird or mammal, except as specified, including, among other things, specified permits and notices.
Because violations of the provisions of the bill would be crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would provide that certain of its provisions are severable and do not apply to the operation of an unmanned aircraft system by a state agency within or over these managed lands or waters, or to any person whom the Federal Aviation Administration authorizes to operate an unmanned aircraft system for a commercial purpose and who operates it in a manner that complies with that authorization.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 3003.5 of, and to add Sections 1746 and 2001.5 to, the Fish and Game Code, and to add Article 4 (commencing with Section 5085) to Chapter 1.2 of Division 5 of the Public Resources Code, relating to unmanned aircraft systems."
1031,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
11450.
(a) (1) (A) Aid shall be paid for each needy family, which shall include all eligible brothers and sisters of each eligible applicant or recipient child and the parents of the children, but shall not include unborn children, or recipients of aid under Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 12000), qualified for aid under this chapter. In determining the amount of aid paid, and notwithstanding the minimum basic standards of adequate care specified in Section 11452, the family’s income, exclusive of any amounts considered exempt as income or paid pursuant to subdivision (e) or Section 11453.1, determined for the prospective semiannual period pursuant to Sections 11265.1, 11265.2, and 11265.3, and then calculated pursuant to Section 11451.5, shall be deducted from the sum specified in the following table, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases pursuant to Section 11453 and paragraph (2). In no case shall the amount of aid paid for each month exceed the sum specified in the following table, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases pursuant to Section 11453 and paragraph (2), plus any special needs, as specified in subdivisions (c), (e), and (f):

(B) If, when, and during those times that the United States government increases or decreases its contributions in assistance of needy children in this state above or below the amount paid on July 1, 1972, the amounts specified in the above table shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to that increase or decrease by the United States government, provided that no increase or decrease shall be subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section 11453.
(2) The sums specified in paragraph (1) shall not be adjusted for cost of living for the 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1995–96, 1996–97, and 1997–98 fiscal years, and through October 31, 1998, nor shall that amount be included in the base for calculating any cost-of-living increases for any fiscal year thereafter. Elimination of the cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the requirements of former Section 11453.05, and no further reduction shall be made pursuant to that section.
(b) (1) When the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid under this chapter, aid shall be paid to a pregnant child who is 18 years of age or younger at any time after verification of pregnancy, in the amount that would otherwise be paid to one person, as specified in subdivision (a), if the child and her child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. Verification of pregnancy shall be required as a condition of eligibility for aid under this subdivision.
(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid under this chapter, aid shall be paid to a pregnant woman for the month in which the birth is anticipated and for the six-month period immediately prior to the month in which the birth is anticipated, in the amount that would otherwise be paid to one person, as specified in subdivision (a), if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. Verification of pregnancy shall be required as a condition of eligibility for aid under this subdivision.
(3) Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Cal-Learn Program is operative.
(c) The amount of forty-seven dollars ($47) per month shall be paid to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) or (b) to meet special needs resulting from pregnancy if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. County welfare departments shall refer all recipients of aid under this subdivision to a local provider of the Women, Infants, and Children program. If that payment to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) is considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, payments under this subdivision shall not apply to persons eligible under subdivision (a), except for the month in which birth is anticipated and for the three-month period immediately prior to the month in which delivery is anticipated, if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter.
(d) For children receiving AFDC-FC under this chapter, there shall be paid, exclusive of any amount considered exempt as income, an amount of aid each month that, when added to the child’s income, is equal to the rate specified in Section 11460, 11461, 11462, 11462.1, or 11463. In addition, the child shall be eligible for special needs, as specified in departmental regulations.
(e) (1) In addition to the amounts payable under subdivision (a) and Section 11453.1, a family shall be entitled to receive an allowance for recurring special needs not common to a majority of recipients. These recurring special needs shall include, but not be limited to, food preparation needs and unusual costs of transportation, laundry, housekeeping services, telephone, and utilities. The recurring special needs allowance for each family per month shall not exceed that amount resulting from multiplying the sum of ten dollars ($10) by the number of recipients in the family who are eligible for assistance.
(2) Each recipient is entitled to a special, diet-related food needs allowance of twenty dollars ($20) per month, or actual verified expenses related to the special, diet-related food needs, whichever is greater. The allowance shall be provided in the form of a supplemental food benefit upon a county’s receipt of verification that a recipient has a special dietary need caused by a permanent or temporary medical condition, other than pregnancy. This verification shall be signed by a licensed physician, dentist,
dietician, nutritionist, or
physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner who has examined the patient, or
other qualified health
practitioner.
care provider to whom the recipient has been referred. For verifications signed by a health care provider as a result of a referral, the verification also shall include the name and address of the referring provider.
(f) After a family has used all available liquid resources, both exempt and nonexempt, in excess of one hundred dollars ($100), with the exception of funds deposited in a restricted account described in subdivision (a) of Section 11155.2, the family shall also be entitled to receive an allowance for nonrecurring special needs.
(1) An allowance for nonrecurring special needs shall be granted for replacement of clothing and household equipment and for emergency housing needs other than those needs addressed by paragraph (2). These needs shall be caused by sudden and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the needy family. The department shall establish the allowance for each of the nonrecurring special needs items. The sum of all nonrecurring special needs provided by this subdivision shall not exceed six hundred dollars ($600) per event.
(2) (A) Homeless assistance is available to a homeless family seeking shelter when the family is eligible for aid under this chapter. Homeless assistance for temporary shelter is also available to homeless families that are apparently eligible for aid under this chapter. Apparent eligibility exists when evidence presented by the applicant, or that is otherwise available to the county welfare department, and the information provided on the application documents indicate that there would be eligibility for aid under this chapter if the evidence and information were verified. However, an alien applicant who does not provide verification of his or her eligible alien status, or a woman with no eligible children who does not provide medical verification of pregnancy, is not apparently eligible for purposes of this section.
(B) A family is considered homeless, for the purpose of this section, when the family lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence; or the family has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations; or the family is residing in a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A family is also considered homeless for the purpose of this section if the family has received a notice to pay rent or quit. The family shall demonstrate that the eviction is the result of a verified financial hardship as a result of extraordinary circumstances beyond their control, and not other lease or rental violations, and that the family is experiencing a financial crisis that could result in homelessness if preventative assistance is not provided.
(3) (A) (i) A nonrecurring special needs benefit of sixty-five dollars ($65) a day shall be available to families of up to four members for the costs of temporary shelter, subject to the requirements of this paragraph. The fifth and additional members of the family shall each receive fifteen dollars ($15) per day, up to a daily maximum of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125). County welfare departments may increase the daily amount available for temporary shelter as necessary to secure the additional bedspace needed by the family.
(ii) This special needs benefit shall be granted or denied immediately upon the family’s application for homeless assistance, and benefits shall be available for up to three working days. The county welfare department shall verify the family’s homelessness within the first three working days and, if the family meets the criteria of questionable homelessness established by the department, the county welfare department shall refer the family to its early fraud prevention and detection unit, if the county has such a unit, for assistance in the verification of homelessness within this period.
(iii) After homelessness has been verified, the three-day limit shall be extended for a period of time which, when added to the initial benefits provided, does not exceed a total of 16 calendar days. This extension of benefits shall be done in increments of one week and shall be based upon searching for permanent housing which shall be documented on a housing search form, good cause, or other circumstances defined by the department. Documentation of a housing search shall be required for the initial extension of benefits beyond the three-day limit and on a weekly basis thereafter as long as the family is receiving temporary shelter benefits. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, situations in which the county welfare department has determined that the family, to the extent it is capable, has made a good faith but unsuccessful effort to secure permanent housing while receiving temporary shelter benefits.
(B) (i) A nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is available to pay for last month’s rent and security deposits when these payments are reasonable conditions of securing a residence, or to pay for up to two months of rent arrearages, when these payments are a reasonable condition of preventing eviction.
(ii) The last month’s rent or monthly arrearage portion of the payment (I) shall not exceed 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size and (II) shall only be made to families that have found permanent housing costing no more than 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size.
(iii) However, if the county welfare department determines that a family intends to reside with individuals who will be sharing housing costs, the county welfare department shall, in appropriate circumstances, set aside the condition specified in subclause (II) of clause (ii).
(C) The nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is also available to cover the standard costs of deposits for utilities which are necessary for the health and safety of the family.
(D) A payment for or denial of permanent housing assistance shall be issued no later than one working day from the time that a family presents evidence of the availability of permanent housing. If an applicant family provides evidence of the availability of permanent housing before the county welfare department has established eligibility for aid under this chapter, the county welfare department shall complete the eligibility determination so that the denial of or payment for permanent housing assistance is issued within one working day from the submission of evidence of the availability of permanent housing, unless the family has failed to provide all of the verification necessary to establish eligibility for aid under this chapter.
(E) (i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), eligibility for the temporary shelter assistance and the permanent housing assistance pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to one period of up to 16 consecutive calendar days of temporary assistance and one payment of permanent assistance. Any family that includes a parent or nonparent caretaker relative living in the home who has previously received temporary or permanent homeless assistance at any time on behalf of an eligible child shall not be eligible for further homeless assistance. Any person who applies for homeless assistance benefits shall be informed that the temporary shelter benefit of up to 16 consecutive days is available only once in a lifetime, with certain exceptions, and that a break in the consecutive use of the benefit constitutes permanent exhaustion of the temporary benefit.
(ii) A family that becomes homeless as a direct and primary result of a state or federally declared natural disaster shall be eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance.
(iii) A family shall be eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance when homelessness is a direct result of domestic violence by a spouse, partner, or roommate; physical or mental illness that is medically verified that shall not include a diagnosis of alcoholism, drug addiction, or psychological stress; or, the uninhabitability of the former residence caused by sudden and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the family including natural catastrophe, fire, or condemnation. These circumstances shall be verified by a third-party governmental or private health and human services agency, except that domestic violence may also be verified by a sworn statement by the victim, as provided under Section 11495.25. Homeless assistance payments based on these specific circumstances may not be received more often than once in any 12-month period. In addition, if the domestic violence is verified by a sworn statement by the victim, the homeless assistance payments shall be limited to two periods of not more than 16 consecutive calendar days of temporary assistance and two payments of permanent assistance. A county may require that a recipient of homeless assistance benefits who qualifies under this paragraph for a second time in a 24-month period participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan as a condition of eligibility for homeless assistance benefits. The county welfare department shall immediately inform recipients who verify domestic violence by a sworn statement of the availability of domestic violence counseling and services, and refer those recipients to services upon request.
(iv) If a county requires a recipient who verifies domestic violence by a sworn statement to participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan pursuant to clause (iii), the plan shall include the provision of domestic violence services, if appropriate.
(v) If a recipient seeking homeless assistance based on domestic violence pursuant to clause (iii) has previously received homeless avoidance services based on domestic violence, the county shall review whether services were offered to the recipient and consider what additional services would assist the recipient in leaving the domestic violence situation.
(vi) The county welfare department shall report necessary data to the department through a statewide homeless assistance payment indicator system, as requested by the department, regarding all recipients of aid under this paragraph.
(F) The county welfare departments, and all other entities participating in the costs of the CalWORKs program, have the right in their share to any refunds resulting from payment of the permanent housing. However, if an emergency requires the family to move within the 12-month period specified in subparagraph (E), the family shall be allowed to use any refunds received from its deposits to meet the costs of moving to another residence.
(G) Payments to providers for temporary shelter and permanent housing and utilities shall be made on behalf of families requesting these payments.
(H) The daily amount for the temporary shelter special needs benefit for homeless assistance may be increased if authorized by the current year’s Budget Act by specifying a different daily allowance and appropriating the funds therefor.
(I) No payment shall be made pursuant to this paragraph unless the provider of housing is a commercial establishment, shelter, or person in the business of renting properties who has a history of renting properties.
(g) The department shall establish rules and regulations ensuring the uniform statewide application of this section.
(h) The department shall notify all applicants and recipients of aid through the standardized application form that these benefits are available and shall provide an opportunity for recipients to apply for the funds quickly and efficiently.
(i)
(A)
(1)
Except for the purposes of Section 15200, the amounts payable to recipients pursuant to Section 11453.1 shall not constitute part of the payment schedule set forth in subdivision (a).
(B)
(2)
The amounts payable to recipients pursuant to Section 11453.1 shall not constitute income to recipients of aid under this section.
(j) For children receiving Kin-GAP pursuant to Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) or Article 4.7 (commencing with Section 11385) there shall be paid, exclusive of any amount considered exempt as income, an amount of aid each month, which, when added to the child’s income, is equal to the rate specified in Sections 11364 and 11387.
(k) (1) A county shall implement the semiannual reporting requirements in accordance with Chapter 501 of the Statutes of 2011 no later than October 1, 2013.
(2) Upon completion of the implementation described in paragraph (1), each county shall provide a certificate to the director certifying that semiannual reporting has been implemented in the county.
(3) Upon filing the certificate described in paragraph (2), a county shall comply with the semiannual reporting provisions of this section.
SEC. 2.
No appropriation pursuant to Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be made for purposes of implementing this act.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients, including an allowance
of $10 for each eligible recipient
for recurring special needs,
as specified.
which includes special diets, upon the recommendation of a physician for conditions other than pregnancy, and unusual costs of transportation, laundry, housekeeping services, telephone, and utilities.
This bill would
include food preparation needs within the recurring special needs for which a recipient may receive the $10 monthly allowance. The bill would also
require that an additional allowance be paid each month in the amount of $20 or actual expenses, whichever is greater, to a recipient who has a special, diet-related food need caused by a permanent or temporary medical condition, other than pregnancy.
The bill would require the verification to be signed by a licensed physician, dentist, dietician, nutritionist, or other qualified health practitioner.
The bill would require verification of the recipient’s medical condition by a health care provider, as specified.
By increasing the administrative duties of counties administering the CalWORKs program, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order for county boards of supervisors and county elections officials to have sufficient time to implement the provisions of this bill
prior to
before
the November 8, 2016, statewide general election, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law requires all voting to be by ballot and requires each polling place to provide, at each election at which public officers are to be voted for, but one form of ballot for all candidates for public office, except for partisan primary elections, as specified. Existing law specifies the order of precedence of offices on the ballot and authorizes a county elections official to vary the order for certain offices and measures submitted to the voters, in order to allow for the most efficient use of space on the ballot in counties that use a voting system, as defined. Existing law requires state measures to always precede local measures.
This bill, for the November 8, 2016, statewide general election only, would authorize a county board of supervisors to direct the county elections official to place a local measure related to
a
local transportation
tax
finance
above state measures.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Section 13109 of the Elections Code, relating to elections, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

CHAPTER  6.3. Oak Woodlands Protection Act
1625.
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Oak Woodlands Protection Act.
1626.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The conservation of oak woodlands enhances the natural scenic beauty for residents and visitors, increases real property values, promotes ecological balance, provides sustainable habitat for over 300 wildlife species and 2,000 plant species, reduces soil erosion, sustains healthy watersheds and water quality, moderates temperature extremes and climate change, and aids with nutrient cycling, all of which affect and improve the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the State of California.
(b) Widespread changes in land use patterns across the landscape and habitat loss due to the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, commonly known as Sudden Oak Death, and infestations of the Goldspotted Oak Borer parasite, are fragmenting oak woodlands’ wildland character over extensive areas of the state. The combination of human impact and other impacts will cumulatively fragment oak ecosystem continuity unless appropriate conservation steps are taken immediately.
(c) The future viability of hundreds of California’s wildlife species are dependent on the maintenance of biologically functional and contiguous oak woodland ecosystems at local and bioregional scales.
(d) A program to encourage and make possible the long-term conservation of oak woodlands is a necessary part of the state’s wildlands protection policies. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to conserve oak woodlands and maintain oak ecosystem health.
1627.
It is the intent of the Legislature that this chapter be construed in light of the following primary objectives:
(a) To conserve oak woodland ecological attributes remaining in California and to provide habitat for wildlife species that are associated with that habitat.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 prohibits a person from conducting timber operations unless a timber harvesting plan prepared by a registered professional forester has been submitted to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Oak Woodlands Conservation Act provides funding for the conservation and protection of California’s oak woodlands. Any violation of the Fish and Game Code is a crime.
This bill would enact the Oak Woodlands Protection Act, which would prohibit a person from removing from an oak woodland, as defined, specified oak trees, unless an oak removal plan and oak removal permit application for the oak tree removal has been submitted to and approved by the Director of Fish and Wildlife.
By June, 30, 2016, the bill would require the Fish and Game Commission to adopt regulations to implement the act, including regulations establishing an oak removal permit application fee. The bill would require the fee to be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund, as created by the bill. Moneys in the fund would be continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of paying the total costs incurred by the department in administering and enforcing the act, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would provide that any person who violates the act is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation. The bill would require all civil penalties collected to be apportioned in a specified manner, including 50% to be distributed to the Wildlife Conservation Board for deposit into the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund.
Existing law requires a county to determine whether a project may result in a conversion of oak woodlands that will have a significant effect on the environment, and if it does, existing law requires the county to require one or more specified oak woodlands mitigation alternatives to mitigate the significant effect.
This bill would delete this law.
To the extent this bill would provide for additional criminal prosecutions for violations of the Fish and Game Code, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Chapter 6.3 (commencing with Section 1625) to Division 2 of the Fish and Game Code, and to repeal Section 21083.4 of the Public Resources Code, relating to forestry, and making an appropriation therefor."

A willful violation of these requirements is a misdemeanor, as specified.
This bill would specify that a business is required to document the specified information described above when it takes possession of a vehicle from a tow truck during hours the business is open to the public and would also authorize the business to document the tow truck driver’s identification number, as specified, or another government authorized unique identifier of the tow truck operator.

2192.
(a) (1) The Trade Corridors Improvement Fund, created pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8879.23 of the Government Code, is hereby continued in existence to receive revenues from state sources other than the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006.
(2) Revenues apportioned to the state under Section 167 of Title 23 of the United States Code from the National Highway Freight Program, pursuant to the federal Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”; Public Law 114-94) shall be allocated for projects approved pursuant to this chapter.
(b) This chapter shall govern expenditure of those state and federal revenues described in subdivision (a).
(c) The funding described in subdivision (a) shall be available upon appropriation for allocation by the California Transportation Commission for infrastructure improvements in this state on federally designated Trade Corridors of National and Regional Significance, on the Primary Freight Network, and along other corridors that have a high volume of freight movement, as determined by the commission. In determining the projects eligible for funding, the commission shall consult the Transportation Agency’s state freight plan as described in Section 13978.8 of the Government Code and the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan released in July 2016 pursuant to Executive Order B-32-15. The commission shall also consult trade infrastructure and goods movement plans adopted by regional transportation planning agencies, adopted regional transportation plans required by state and federal law, and the applicable port master plan when determining eligible projects for funding. Eligible projects for the funding described in subdivision (a) shall further the state’s economic, environmental, and public health objectives and goals for freight policy, as articulated in the plans to be consulted pursuant to this subdivision, and may include, but are not limited to, all of the following:
(1) Highway capacity improvements, rail landside access improvements, landside freight access improvements to airports, and operational improvements to more efficiently accommodate the movement of freight, particularly for ingress and egress to and from the state’s land ports of entry, rail terminals, and seaports, including navigable inland waterways used to transport freight between seaports, land ports of entry, and airports, and to relieve traffic congestion along major trade or goods movement corridors.
(2) Freight rail system improvements to enhance the ability to move goods from seaports, land ports of entry, and airports to warehousing and distribution centers throughout California, including projects that separate rail lines from highway or local road traffic, improve freight rail mobility through mountainous regions, relocate rail switching yards, and other projects that improve the efficiency and capacity of the rail freight system.
(3) Projects to enhance the capacity and efficiency of ports.
(4) Truck corridor and capital and operational improvements, including dedicated truck facilities or truck toll facilities.
(5) Border capital and operational improvements that enhance goods movement between California and Mexico and that maximize the state’s ability to access funds made available to the state by federal law.
(6) Surface transportation and connector road improvements to effectively facilitate the movement of goods, particularly for ingress and egress to and from the state’s land ports of entry, airports, and seaports, to relieve traffic congestion along major trade or goods movement corridors.
(d) (1) In selecting projects for inclusion in the program of projects to be funded with funds described in subdivision (a), the commission shall evaluate the total potential costs and total potential economic and noneconomic benefits of the program to California’s economy, environment, and public health. The commission shall consult with the State Air Resources Board in order to utilize the appropriate models, techniques, and methods to develop the parameters for evaluation of projects. The commission shall allocate the funding described in subdivision (a) for trade infrastructure improvements consistent with Section 8879.52 of the Government Code and the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund (TCIF) Guidelines adopted by the commission on November 27, 2007, or as amended by the commission, and in a manner that (A) addresses the state’s most urgent needs, (B) balances the demands of various land ports of entry, seaports, and airports, (C) provides reasonable geographic balance between the state’s regions, (D) places emphasis on projects that improve trade corridor mobility and safety while reducing emissions of diesel particulates, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants, and reducing other negative community impacts, and (E) makes a significant contribution to the state’s economy. The commission shall adopt any amendments to the 2007 guidelines on or before April 1, 2017.
(2) In adopting amended guidelines, and developing and adopting the program of projects, the commission shall do all of the following:
(A) Accept nominations for projects to be included in the program of projects from regional and local transportation agencies and the Department of Transportation.
(B) Recognize the key role of the state in project identification and support integrating statewide goods movement priorities into the corridor approach.
(C) Make a finding that adoption and delivery of the program of projects is in the public interest.
(3) In addition, the commission shall also consider the following factors when allocating these funds:
(A) “Velocity,” which means the speed by which large cargo would travel from the land port of entry or seaport through the distribution system.
(B) “Throughput,” which means the volume of cargo that would move from the land port of entry or seaport through the distribution system.
(C) “Reliability,” which means a reasonably consistent and predictable amount of time for cargo to travel from one point to another on any given day or at any given time in California.
(D) “Congestion reduction,” which means the reduction in recurrent daily hours of delay to be achieved.

The commission shall allocate funds made available by this chapter to projects that have identified and committed supplemental funding from appropriate local, federal, or private sources. The commission shall determine the appropriate amount of supplemental funding each project should have to be eligible for moneys based on a project-by-project review and an assessment of the project’s benefit to the state and the program. Funded improvements shall have supplemental funding that is at least equal to the amount of the contribution under this chapter. The commission may give priority for funding to projects with higher levels of committed supplemental funding.","The Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006 (Proposition 1B) created the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund and provided for allocation by the California Transportation Commission of $2 billion in bond funds for infrastructure improvements on highway and rail corridors that have a high volume of freight movement, and specified categories of projects eligible to receive these funds. Existing law continues the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in existence in order to receive revenues from sources other than the bond act for these purposes.
This bill would require revenues apportioned to the state from the National Highway Freight Program established by the federal Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act to be allocated for trade corridor improvement projects approved pursuant to these provisions.
Existing law requires the commission, in determining projects eligible for funding, to consult various state freight and regional infrastructure and goods movement plans and the statewide port master plan.
This bill would delete consideration of the State Air Resources Board’s Sustainable Freight Strategy and the statewide port master plan and would instead include consideration of the applicable port master plan and the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan of July 2016 when determining eligible projects for funding. The bill would also expand eligible projects to include rail landside access improvements, landside freight access improvements to airports, and certain capital and operational improvements. The bill would require the commission to use existing guidelines for the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in allocating available funding but would authorize the commission to adopt amendments to the guidelines by April 1, 2017, and would impose various other requirements on the commission.","An act to amend Sections 2192 and 2192.2 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation."

1040,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a green infrastructure program that would encourage state agencies to account for and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with
energy-intensive
emissions-intensive
products that are used in major infrastructure projects and funded in whole or in part with state funds. This program would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with
energy-intensive
emissions-intensive
products by providing a market for high-quality goods with the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions.
(b) If
energy-intensive
emissions-intensive
products are sourced from facilities that do not comply with California’s climate energy goals or if a product is transported a long distance to the job site, it creates a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions that is part of the emissions total California is seeking to reduce by 2020. By ignoring these emissions, California is shifting the burden of emissions reductions to other portions of the economy and this places additional burden on California’s businesses and consumers. It would be better for consumers if the state acknowledges the emissions associated with large infrastructure projects and crafts a procurement process to procure a green product, a product that lowers greenhouse gas emissions while still meeting quality standards.
(c) Executive Order B-30-15 issued by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. stipulates that “State agencies shall take climate change into account in their planning and investment decisions and employ full life-cycle cost accounting to evaluate and compare infrastructure investments and alternatives.” It also notes that state agencies’ planning investments shall be guided by principles that build climate preparedness and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2022.
(2) Existing law provides that, if a licensed health care provider determines that an athlete sustained a concussion or a head injury while engaging in an athletic activity, the athlete is required to complete a graduated return-to-play protocol of no less than 7 days in duration under the supervision of a licensed health care provider.
This bill would require a school district, charter school, or private school that offers an interscholastic athletic program to collect and maintain data on traumatic brain injuries and concussions sustained by any of its pupils during an interscholastic athletic activity. The bill would require that this data be reported periodically to the appropriate county office of education, and would require the county office of education to compile and retain the data for summary and analysis as it deems necessary. By imposing new duties on county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 49475.6 to, and to add and repeal Section 49475.5 of, the Education Code, relating to school athletics."

(1) The officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense in the officer’s presence.
(2) The person arrested has committed a felony, although not in the officer’s presence.
(3) The officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a felony, whether or not a felony, in fact, has been committed.
(b) Any time a peace officer is called out on a domestic violence call, it shall be mandatory that the officer make a good faith effort to inform the victim of his or her right to make a citizen’s arrest, unless the peace officer makes an arrest for a violation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 243 or 273.5. This information shall include advising the victim how to safely execute the arrest.

Existing law requires the Department of Justice to seek to control and eradicate organized crime by, among other things, gathering, analyzing, and storing intelligence related to organized crime and providing this intelligence to local, state, and federal law enforcement units. Existing law also requires, prior to a local law enforcement agency designating, or submitting a document to the Attorney General’s office for the purpose of designating, a person as a gang member, associate, or affiliate in a shared gang database, as defined, the local law enforcement agency to provide written notice to the person and his or her parent or guardian of the designation and the basis for the designation if the person is under 18 years of age, except as specified.

Existing law repeals the provisions establishing the board and authority for it to appoint an executive officer on January 1, 2017.
The bill would extend the operation of the board and the board’s authority to appoint an executive officer until January 1, 2019.
Existing law requires, among other things, the completion of an approved educational and training program in order to be issued a license to practice acupuncture. For purposes of the act, beginning January 1, 2017, existing law defines “approved educational and training program” as a school or college offering education and training in the practice of an acupuncturist who meets various requirements, including offering curriculum that includes specified hours of didactic and laboratory training and supervised clinical instruction. Existing law requires these programs to submit that curriculum to the board and to receive board approval of the curriculum.
This bill would provide that any school or college offering education and training in the practice of acupuncture that was approved by the board prior to January 1, 2017, is deemed to have had its curriculum approved by the board if its approval has not been revoked and it has not changed its curriculum since receiving board approval.
Beginning January 1, 2017, existing law requires the board to establish standards for the approval of educational training and clinical experience received outside the United States.
This bill would repeal that board requirement. The bill would instead require an applicant completing education outside of the United States to submit documentation of his or her education to a board approved credential evaluation service for evaluation and to have the results of the evaluation sent directly from the credential evaluation service to the board. The bill would require the board to examine the received results to determine if an applicant meets requirements for licensure and, if the evaluated education is not sufficient, would authorize the board to offer the applicant additional education, training, or testing, as specified. The bill would require the board to establish, by regulation, an application process, criteria, and procedures for approval of a credential evaluation service. The bill would require the regulations to, at a minimum, require the credential evaluation service to meet specified requirements. The bill would define, for these purposes, an “approved credential evaluation service” as an agency or organization that is approved by the board to evaluate education completed outside the United States and identify the equivalency of that education to education completed within the United States.

(b) Benefits specified by subdivision (a) based on service performed in the employ of a nonprofit organization, or of a public entity, as defined by Section 605, with respect to service in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution are not payable to any individual with respect to any week which begins during the period between two successive academic years or terms or, when an agreement provides instead for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, during that period, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual’s contract, if the individual performs services in the first of the academic years or terms and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services for any educational institution in the second of the academic years or terms.
(c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), benefits specified by subdivision (a) based on service performed in the employ of a nonprofit organization, or of a public entity, as defined by Section 605, with respect to service in any other capacity than specified in subdivision (b) for an educational institution shall not be payable to any individual with respect to any week which commences during a period between two successive academic years or terms if the individual performs the service in the first of the academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service in the second of the academic years or terms. However, if the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform the services for an educational institution for the second of the academic years or terms, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this subdivision. Retroactive benefits shall be claimed in accordance with the department’s procedures which shall specify that except where the individual was entitled to benefits based on services performed for other than an educational institution, an individual who has a reasonable assurance of reemployment may satisfy the search for work requirement of subdivision (e) of Section 1253, by registering for work pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1253 during the period between the first and second academic terms or years. A claim for retroactive benefits may be made no later than 30 days following the commencement of the second academic year or term.
(2) Benefits specified by subdivision (a) are authorized for an employee of a public school, as defined in Section 22161 of the Education Code, for the period between two successive academic years or terms, as described in paragraph (1), as follows:
(A) Two weeks of benefits during 2017, beginning July 1, provided that funds are appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
(B) Four weeks of benefits during 2018, beginning July 1, provided that funds are appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
(C) Six weeks of benefits during 2019, beginning July 1, provided that funds are appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
(D) Eight weeks of benefits during 2020, and each year thereafter, beginning July 1, provided that funds are appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
(d) Benefits specified by subdivision (a) based on service performed in the employ of a nonprofit organization, or of any entity as defined by Section 605, with respect to services specified by subdivision (b) or (c), are not payable to any individual with respect to any week that commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs the specified services in the period immediately before the vacation period or holiday recess, and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services in the period immediately following the vacation period or holiday recess.
(e) With respect to any services specified by subdivision (b) or (c), compensation payable on the basis of services in that capacity may be denied as specified in subdivision (b), (c), or (d) to any individual who performed the services in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency, and for this purpose the term “educational service agency” is defined as a governmental agency or governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing the services to one or more educational institutions.
(f) Benefits specified by subdivision (a) based on service performed in the employ of a nonprofit organization, or of any entity as defined by Section 605, are not payable during the periods of time, and subject to the same conditions, contained in subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (h), if the services are provided to, or on behalf of, an educational institution.
(g) For purposes of this section, “reasonable assurance” includes, but is not limited to, an offer of employment or assignment made by the educational institution, provided that the offer or assignment is not contingent on enrollment, funding, or program changes. An individual who has been notified that he or she will be replaced and does not have an offer of employment or assignment to perform services for an educational institution is not considered to have reasonable assurance.
(h) For purposes of this section, if the time for service performed during the period of and pursuant to any contract for any academic year or term by an individual for any employing unit as specified in subdivision (b) or (c) constitutes one-half or more of the time in total service performed for the employing unit by the individual during that same period for remuneration, all the services of the individual for the employing unit for that period shall be deemed subject to the benefit payment restriction provisions of this section.
(i) Any entity as defined by Section 605, with respect to any individual performing a service in any other capacity other than specified in subdivision (b) for an educational institution, shall provide a written statement indicating the following to the individual no later than 30 days before the end of the first of the academic years or terms:
(1) Whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of reemployment.
(2) Whether or not it is stated that the individual has no reasonable assurance of reemployment, that the individual should file a claim for benefits at the close of the academic year or term.
(3) If it is stated that the individual has reasonable assurance of reemployment, the written statement shall also inform the employee that he or she may file a claim for benefits and that the determination for eligibility for benefits is made by the Employment Development Department and not by the employer.
(4) If it is stated that the individual has reasonable assurance of reemployment, that the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits if the individual is not offered an opportunity to perform the services for the educational institution for the second of the academic years or terms, if the individual is otherwise eligible and he or she filed a claim for each week benefits are claimed, and if a claim for retroactive benefits is made no later than 30 days following the commencement of the second academic year or term.","Existing law provides for the payment of unemployment compensation benefits and extended duration benefits to eligible persons who meet specified requirements. Existing law prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to educational institution employees of a public entity, as defined, including teachers, researchers, and administrators for the period between 2 academic years when there is a reasonable assurance that the employee will perform his or her regular services in the subsequent academic year, except as specified. Existing law similarly prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to specified educational institution employees of a public entity other than teachers, researchers, or administrators between 2 academic years, except as specified, but provides a procedure for this 2nd category of educational employees, under certain conditions, to seek payment of retroactive unemployment benefits for the period between 2 academic years. Existing law requires specified notice regarding reasonable assurance of employment in the following academic term be sent to employees before the end of the current academic term.
This bill would delete the prohibition on the payment of unemployment benefits to education employees of a public school, other than teachers, researchers, and administrators, as specified, between 2 academic years. The bill would phase in up to 8 weeks of benefits available to those specified employees over a 4-year timeframe contingent on funds being appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
Because this bill would expand the categories of people who could receive benefits from the Unemployment Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.","An act to amend Section 1253.3 of the Unemployment Insurance Code, relating to unemployment insurance, and making an appropriation therefor."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law provides various circumstances that constitute rape, which are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 6, or 8 years, except as specified.
Existing law also prescribes circumstances that constitute unlawful sexual intercourse, some of which involve an adult perpetrator who engages in that unlawful intercourse with a minor, as specified. Unlawful sexual intercourse under those circumstances is punishable by imprisonment for 2, 3, or 4 years, and also may be subject to designated civil penalties or fines. Under existing law, any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to a specified provision of law for 2, 3, or 4 years.
This bill would subject any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age and is convicted of a felony to a sentence enhancement of 2 years, if the perpetrator holds a position of authority over the minor with whom he or she engaged in the act of unlawful sexual intercourse. By changing the penalty for the commission of unlawful sexual intercourse under the above circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes it a crime for a person to engage in specified acts of a sexual nature with a minor, including lewd and lascivious conduct when the victim is a child of 14 or 15 years of age and the person is at least 10 years older, and sodomy, oral copulation, or sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age when the person is 21 years of age or older.
This bill would impose an additional term of 2 years when a person who is convicted of a felony violation of the above crimes is a person who holds a position of authority, as defined, over the minor victim. By increasing the penalty for a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 261.5 of, and to add Section 287 to, the Penal Code, relating to sexual offenses."

1048,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California imports 91 percent of its natural gas, which is responsible for 25 percent of the state’s emissions of greenhouse gases.
(b) California made a commitment to address climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) and the adoption of a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (Chapter 4.2 (commencing with Section 39730) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code). For California to meet its goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants, the state must reduce emissions from the natural gas sector and increase the production and distribution of renewable and low-carbon gas supplies.
(c) Biomethane is gas generated from organic waste through anaerobic digestion, gasification, pyrolysis, or other conversion technology that converts organic matter to gas. Biomethane may be produced from multiple sources, including agricultural waste, forest waste, landfill gas, wastewater treatment byproducts, and diverted organic waste.
(d) Biomethane provides a sustainable and clean alternative to natural gas. If 10 percent of California’s natural gas use were to be replaced with biomethane use, emissions of greenhouse gases would be reduced by tens of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent every year.
(e) Investing in biomethane would create cobenefits, including flexible generation of electricity from a renewable source that is available 24 hours a day, reduction of fossil fuel use, reduction of air and water pollution, and new jobs.
(f) Biomethane can also be used as transportation fuel or injected into natural gas pipelines for other uses. The most appropriate use of biomethane varies depending on the source, proximity to existing natural gas pipeline injection points or large vehicle fleets, and the circumstances of existing facilities.
(g) The biomethane market has been slow to develop in California because the collection, purification, and pipeline injection of biomethane can be costly.
(h) Biomethane is poised to play a key role in future natural gas and hydrogen fuel markets as a blendstock that can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of these two fossil-based alternative fuels.
(i) Biomethane is one of the most promising alternative vehicle fuels because it generates the least net emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the low-carbon fuel standard regulations (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations) adopted by the State Air Resources Board, vehicles running on biomethane generate significantly lower emissions of greenhouse gases than vehicles running on electricity or fossil fuel-derived hydrogen.
(j) The California Council on Science and Technology was established by California academic research institutions, including the University of California, the University of Southern California, the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the California State University, and was organized as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, in response to Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 162 (Resolution Chapter 148 of the Statutes of 1988).
(k) The California Council on Science and Technology was uniquely established at the request of the Legislature for the specific purpose of offering expert advice to state government on public policy issues significantly related to science and technology.
(l) It is in the public’s interests, and in the interest of ratepayers of the state’s gas corporations, that the policies and programs adopted by the Public Utilities Commission be guided by the best science reasonably available.

(2) Direct solar energy.
(c) In adopting the policy described in subdivision (b), the state board shall ensure that eligible renewable gas provides direct benefits to the state’s environment by reducing or avoiding all of the following:
(1) Emissions of criteria pollutants.
(2) Emissions that adversely affect the waters of the state.
(3) Nuisances associated with the emission of odors.

784.1.
(a)The Legislature requests that the California Council on Science and Technology undertake and complete a study analyzing the regional and gas corporation specific issues relating to minimum heating value and maximum siloxane specifications for biomethane before it can be injected into common carrier gas pipelines, including those specifications adopted in Sections 4.4.3.3 and 4.4.4 of commission Decision 14-01-034 (January 16, 2014), Decision Regarding the Biomethane Implementation Tasks in Assembly Bill 1900. The study shall consider and evaluate other states’ standards, the source of biomethane, the dilution of biomethane after it is injected into the pipeline, the equipment and technology upgrades required to meet the minimum heating value specifications, including the impacts of those specifications on the cost, volume of biomethane sold, equipment operation, and safety. The study shall also consider whether different sources of biogas should have different standards or if all sources should adhere to one standard for the minimum heating value and maximum permissible level of siloxanes. The study shall develop the best science reasonably available and not merely be a literature review. In order to meet the state’s goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants and the state’s goals for promoting the use of renewable energy resources in place of burning fossil fuels, the California Council on Science and Technology, if it agrees to undertake and complete the study, shall complete the study within nine months of entering into a contract to undertake and complete the study.
(b)(1)If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study pursuant to subdivision (a), the commission shall require each gas corporation operating common carrier pipelines in California to proportionately contribute to the expenses to undertake the study pursuant to Sections 740 and 740.1. The commission may modify the monetary incentives made available pursuant to commission Decision 15-06-029 (June 11, 2015), Decision Regarding the Costs of Compliance with Decision 14-01-034 and Adoption of Biomethane Promotion Policies and Program, to allocate some of the moneys that would be made available for incentives to instead be made available to pay for the costs of the study so as to not further burden ratepayers with additional expense.
(2)The commission’s authority pursuant to paragraph (1) shall apply notwithstanding whether the gas corporation has proposed the program pursuant to Section 740.1.
(c)If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study pursuant to subdivision (a), within six months of its completion, the commission shall reevaluate its requirements and standards adopted pursuant to Section 25421 of the Health and Safety Code relative to the requirements and standards for biomethane to be injected into common carrier pipelines and, if appropriate, change those requirements and standards or adopt new requirements and standards, giving due deference to the conclusions and recommendations made in the study by the California Council on Science and Technology.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1)The
The
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020 equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. Existing law requires the state board to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including gas corporations. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers during specified compliance periods.
This bill would require the state board, in coordination with the Public Utilities
Commission and State Energy Resources and Conservation Development
Commission, to
consider and, as appropriate,
adopt a policy
or programs
to increase the production and use of renewable gas, as specified, generated by either an eligible renewable energy resource that meets the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program or direct solar energy, as specified.
(2)Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law authorizes certain public utilities, including gas corporations, to propose research and development programs and authorizes the commission to allow inclusion of expenses for research and development in the public utility’s rates. Existing law requires the commission to consider specified guidelines in evaluating the research, development, and demonstration programs proposed by gas corporations.
The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the commission to adopt policies and programs that promote the in-state production and distribution of biomethane. Existing law requires the commission to adopt, by rule or order, (1) standards for biomethane that specify the concentrations of constituents of concern that are reasonably necessary to protect public health and ensure pipeline integrity and safety, as specified, and (2) requirements for monitoring, testing, reporting, and recordkeeping, as specified. Existing law requires a gas corporation to comply with those standards and requirements and requires that gas corporation tariffs condition access to common carrier pipelines on the applicable customer meeting those standards and requirements.
This bill would request the California Council on Science and Technology to undertake and complete a study analyzing the regional and gas corporation specific issues relating to minimum heating value and maximum siloxane specifications adopted by the commission for biomethane before it can be injected into common carrier gas pipelines. If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study, the bill would require each gas corporation operating common carrier pipelines in California to proportionately contribute to the expenses to undertake the study with the cost recoverable in rates. The bill would authorize the commission to modify certain available monetary incentives to allocate some of the incentive moneys to pay for the costs of the study so as to not further burden ratepayers with additional expense. If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study, the bill would require the commission, within 6 months of its completion, to reevaluate requirements and standards adopted for injection of biomethane into common carrier pipelines and, if appropriate, change those requirements and standards or adopt new requirements and standards, giving due deference to the conclusions and recommendations made in the study.
(3)Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
Because certain provisions of the bill would be a part of the act and a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing its requirements would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 39734 to the Health and Safety Code,

(c) This section shall not apply to campus-based fees approved prior to the enactment of this section.
SEC. 2.
Section 89712 of the Education Code, as added by Section 2 of Chapter 636 of the Statutes of 2015, is amended to read:
89712.
(a) (1) Neither a campus of the California State University nor the Chancellor of the California State University shall approve a new student success fee or an increase to an existing student success fee, as defined in subdivision (g), before all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(A) The campus undertakes a rigorous consultation process that informs and educates students on the uses, impact, and cost of any proposed student success fee or student success fee increase.
(B) The campus informs its students of all of the following circumstances,
each of
which shall apply to these fees:
(i) That, except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a student success fee may be rescinded by a majority vote of the students, as specified in subdivision (c).
(ii) That a student success fee may not be rescinded earlier than six years following the vote to implement the fee.
(iii) If any portion of the student success fee is committed to support a long-term obligation, that portion of the fee may not be rescinded until the obligation has been satisfied.
(C) The campus shall hold a binding student election on the implementation of any proposed student success fees, or any increase to an existing student success fee, and two-thirds of the student body voting on the fee must vote affirmatively.
(2) Implementation of a fee supported by two-thirds of the campus student body voting on the fee is contingent upon the final approval of the Chancellor of the California State University.
(3) A student success fee proposal may not be brought before the student body more frequently than once per academic year.
(b) A student success fee in place on January 1, 2016, may be rescinded by a binding student vote under the procedures authorized in subdivision (c) only after at least six years have elapsed following the implementation of the fee.

(A) A campus decision to vote is formally approved by the recognized student government.
(B) Rescission vote proposals shall not be brought before the student body more frequently than once per academic year.
(C) In the process of reconsidering a student success fee, and before the student vote occurs, the students shall be informed, if a portion of the fee is supporting a long-term obligation, the dollar amount of that portion, and the date on which the long-term obligation would be satisfied.

shall report, by December 1 of each year, to the Department of Finance, and the Legislature pursuant to Section 9795 of the Government Code, a summary of the fees adopted or rescinded in the prior academic year, and the uses of proposed and currently implemented fees.
(g) For purposes of this section, a “student success fee” is a type of category II campus-based mandatory fee that is required to be paid by a student before that student may enroll or attend a campus of the California State University, as determined by that campus or the Chancellor of the California State University.","Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the trustees by rule to require all persons to pay fees, rents, deposits, and charges for services, facilities, or materials provided by the trustees to those persons. Existing law prohibits specified California State University campus-based mandatory fees from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of the majority of the members of either the student body or a specified campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation, unless the vote that established the fee authorizes an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee.
Existing law prohibits a campus of the California State University, or the Chancellor of the California State University, from imposing a student success fee, as defined, unless certain requirements are met. Among these requirements is an affirmative vote of a majority of the student body voting at a binding student election.
This bill would increase the affirmative vote required for the imposition of a student success fee from a majority to
2/3
of the student body voting on that proposed fee. The bill would also make a technical conforming change in a related provision.","An act to amend Sections 89711 and 89712 of the Education Code, relating to the California State University."

66407.3.
(a) The Trustees of the California State University and the governing board of each community college district shall, and the Regents of the University of California are requested to, require its faculty members to annually disclose, on or before April 15, 2017, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, on a form and in a manner to be determined by the trustees, the governing board, or the regents, as appropriate, all of the income he or she received in the immediately preceding calendar year from a publisher, periodical, or provider of online content for royalties, advances, consulting services, or for any other purpose.
A faculty member to whom this section is applicable shall be required to file a form even if he or she has no disclosable income in the calendar year. A faculty member shall file the form required by this section under penalty of perjury.
(b) The trustees, community college district governing boards, and regents shall ensure that the information provided by the faculty members pursuant to subdivision (a) is available to the public on the Internet Web site of the institution at which the faculty members teach. The information provided by an individual faculty member pursuant to this section shall remain available on the Internet Web site for as long as that individual is employed as a teacher at that institution.
(c) The trustees, community college district governing board, and the regents, as appropriate, may require, with proper notice and an opportunity for a hearing, a faculty member who does not file the information required pursuant to this section in a timely manner to pay an administrative fine of up to
25 percent of the unreported income or five thousand dollars ($5,000), whichever is smaller.
fifty dollars ($50).
The proceeds of any administrative fines

pursuant to this subdivision shall be collected by the trustees or by a community college district governing board, as appropriate, and shall be deposited in a fund for allocation pursuant to subdivision (d).
(d) (1) The trustees shall deposit the proceeds of administrative fines collected pursuant to subdivision (c) into the California State University Faculty Royalty Disclosure Fund, which is hereby established.

(2) The governing board of a community college district is authorized to expend the proceeds of any administrative fines collected pursuant to subdivision (c) for general educational purposes at the campus at which the faculty member who was assessed the fine is employed.
(3) The regents are requested to allocate the proceeds of any administrative fines collected pursuant to subdivision (c) in a manner similar to that described in paragraph (1).
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII   B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII   B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law, known as the Donahoe Higher Education Act, sets forth the missions and functions of the segments of postsecondary education in this state. The California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, constitute the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Provisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act apply to the University of California only to the extent that the regents act, by appropriate resolution, to make those provisions applicable.
An existing chapter of the Donahoe Higher Education Act relates to the use of academic materials, and provides that a court of competent jurisdiction is authorized to grant relief that is necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter, including through the issuance of an injunction.
This chapter also includes the College Textbook Transparency Act which, among other things, provides that certain faculty members, defined as adopters, are authorized to receive royalties or other compensation from sales of course materials that include the instructor’s writing or other work, subject to the employer’s standing policies or collective bargaining agreements relating to employee conflicts of interest.
This bill would add to this chapter a provision that requires the trustees and the governing board of each community college district, and requests the regents, to require their faculty members to annually disclose, on or before April 15, 2017, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, on a form and in a manner to be determined by the trustees, the governing board, or the regents, as appropriate, all of the income he or she received in the immediately preceding calendar year from a publisher, periodical, or provider of online content for royalties, advances, consulting services, or for any other purpose.
The bill would require faculty members to whom the bill is applicable to file a form even if they have no disclosable income in the calendar year. The bill would require that these forms be filed under penalty of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of the crime of perjury.
The bill would require that the information provided by the faculty members under this bill be available to the public on the Internet Web site of the institution at which the faculty members teach, as specified. The bill would authorize the trustees, community college governing boards, or regents to require a faculty member who does not file the information required under this bill in a timely manner to pay an administrative fine of up to
25% of the unreported income or $5,000, whichever is smaller,
$50,
as specified.
The bill would authorize the trustees and the community college district governing boards to expend the proceeds of these fines for general educational purposes at the campuses at which the faculty members who were assessed the fines were employed. With respect to the California State University, the bill would establish the California State University Faculty Royalty Disclosure Fund as a continuously appropriated fund for the deposit of fine proceeds and their allocation to the appropriate campuses. The bill would request the regents to allocate the proceeds of any administrative fines they collect pursuant to the bill in a manner similar to that described for the California State University.
To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, this bill would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to

(d) Payments shall also be made directly to the Regents of the University of California on the basis of an amount for each unit of equivalent full-time enrollment.
(e) Payments shall also be made directly to the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law on the basis of an amount for each unit of equivalent full-time enrollment.
(f) Payments shall also be made directly to the Department of the Youth Authority for educational programs serving kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or any part thereof, on the basis of an equal amount for each unit of average daily attendance, as defined by law.

(i) No Budget Act or other statutory provision shall direct that payments for public education made pursuant to this chapter be used for purposes and programs, including workload adjustments and maintenance of the level of service, authorized by Chapters 498, 565, and 1302 of the Statutes of 1983, Chapter 97 or 258 of the Statutes of 1984, or Chapter 1 of the Statutes of the 1983–84 Second Extraordinary Session.
(j) School districts and other agencies receiving funds distributed pursuant to this chapter may at their option utilize funds allocated by this chapter to provide additional funds for those purposes and programs prescribed by subdivision (i) for the purpose of enrichment or expansion.
(k) As a condition of receiving any moneys pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), each school district and county superintendent of schools shall establish a separate account for the receipt and expenditure of those moneys, which account shall be clearly identified as a lottery education account.
(l) Commencing with the 1998–99 fiscal year, and each year thereafter, for purposes of subdivision (a), average daily attendance shall be increased by the statewide average rate of excused absences for the 1996–97 fiscal year as determined pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 855 of the Statutes of 1997. The statewide average excused absence rate, and the corresponding adjustment factor required for the operation of this subdivision, shall be certified to the Controller by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
(m) It is the intent of this chapter that all funds allocated from the California State Lottery Education Fund shall be used exclusively for the education of pupils and students and no funds shall be spent for acquisition of real property, construction of facilities, financing of research, or any other noninstructional purpose.

The Legislature finds and declares both of the following:
(a) This act furthers the purpose of the California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by Proposition 37 at the November 6, 1984, general election by eliminating inefficient administrative procedures that the Board of Trustees of the California State University and the Controller utilize on a quarterly basis.
(b) This act shall not be interpreted to expand the lawful uses of funds allocated from the California State Lottery Education Fund to the Board of Trustees of the California State University.","(1) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by initiative, authorizes a California State Lottery and provides for its operation and administration by the California State Lottery Commission and the Director of the California State Lottery, with certain limitations. The act establishes the California State Lottery Education Fund and provides for direct payments from the fund to various entities, including the Board of Trustees of the California State University. The act requires funds received by the trustees to be deposited in, and expended from, the California State University Lottery Education Fund or, at the discretion of the trustees, deposited in local trust accounts.
Existing law establishes the California State University Trust Fund and specifies its sources of revenue. Existing law provides that all money received by the fund shall augment the support appropriation to the California State University for the fiscal year to which the collections apply.
This bill would require the trustees to deposit funds received from the California State Lottery Education Fund in the California State University Trust Fund instead of the California State University Lottery Education Fund. The bill would continue to allow the trustees, in their discretion, to deposit the funds in local trust accounts.
(2) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, an initiative measure, specifies that none of its provisions may be changed except to further its purpose by a bill passed by a
2/3
vote of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor.
This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes of the act, as specified, and that the act shall not be interpreted to expand the lawful uses of funds allocated from the California State Lottery Education Fund to the trustees.","An act to amend Section 8880.5 of the Government Code, relating to the California State Lottery Act."

SECTION 1.
Section 19855 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
19855.
Except as otherwise provided by statute or regulation, every person who, by statute or regulation, is required to hold a state license shall obtain the license prior to engaging in the activity or occupying the position with respect to which the license is required. Every person who, by order of the commission, is required to apply for a gambling license or a finding of suitability shall file the application within 60 calendar days after receipt of the order.
SEC. 2.
Section 19858 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
19858.
(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a person shall be deemed to be unsuitable to hold a state gambling license to own a gambling establishment if the person, or any partner, officer, director, or shareholder of the person, has any financial interest in any business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited by Section 330 of the Penal Code, whether within or without this state.
(b) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to a publicly traded racing association, a qualified racing association, or any person who is licensed pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 19852.
(c) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to a person who meets all of the following criteria:
(1) The person is licensed or had an application to be licensed on file with the commission on or before February 1, 2013.
(2) The person has a financial interest in a business or organization engaged in gambling prohibited by Section 330 of the Penal Code that was closed and was not engaged in prohibited gambling at the time the person was either licensed or had filed an application to be licensed with the commission.
(3) The person has a financial interest in a gambling establishment that is located on any portion of, or contiguous to, the grounds on which a racetrack is or had been previously located and horserace meetings were authorized to be conducted by the California Horse Racing Board on or before January 1, 2012.
(4) The grounds upon which the gambling establishment described in paragraph (3) is located are directly or indirectly owned by a racetrack limited partnership owner. For purposes of this paragraph, a “racetrack limited partnership owner” means a limited partnership, or a number of related limited partnerships, that is or are at least 80 percent capitalized by limited partners that are an “institutional investor” as defined in subdivision (w) of Section 19805, an “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 1002(3) of Title 29 of the United States Code, or an investment company that manages a state university endowment.
(d) Within six years of the date the closed business or organization reopens or becomes engaged in any form of gambling prohibited by Section 330 of the Penal Code, a person described in subdivision (c) shall either divest that person’s interest in the business or organization, or divest that person’s interest in the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment for which the person is licensed or has applied to be licensed by the commission.
(e) A person described in subdivision (c) shall inform the commission within 30 days of the date on which a business or organization in which the person has a financial interest begins to engage in any form of gambling prohibited by Section 330 of the Penal Code.

For purposes of this subdivision, “cross-promotion or marketing” means the offering to any customers of the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment anything of value related to visiting or gambling at the business or organization engaged in any form of gambling prohibited by Section 330 of the Penal Code.
(g) During the six-year divestment period described in subdivision (d), any funds used in connection with the capital improvement of the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) shall not be provided from the gaming revenues of either the business or organization engaged in gaming prohibited under Section 330 of the Penal Code.
(h) If, at the end of the six-year divestment period described in subdivision (d), any person described in subdivision (c) has not divested his or her interest in either the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment or the business or organization engaged in any form of gaming prohibited under Section 330 of the Penal Code, the prohibitions of Section 19858 as it read on January 1, 2013, apply.

(b) (1) A report submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(2) Pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, this section is repealed on July 1, 2022.
SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances surrounding the City of Inglewood with respect to the construction of the City of Champions Revitalization Project and the project’s impact on the divestment requirement described in the Gambling Control Act, which governs the statewide regulation and enforcement of certain legalized gambling activities in the State.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Gambling Control Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of various legalized gambling activities and establishments by the California Gambling Control Commission and the investigation and enforcement of those activities and establishments by the Department of Justice. A willful violation of the act is a misdemeanor. Existing law requires every person who is required to hold a state license to obtain the license prior to engaging in the activity or occupying the position with respect to which the license is required, except as specified. Existing law also requires every person who, by order of the commission, is required to apply for a gambling license or a finding of suitability to file an application within 45 calendar days after receipt of the order.
This bill would instead require the application described above to be filed within 60 calendar days after receipt of an order of the commission.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person who deals, plays, or carries on, opens, or causes to be opened, or who conducts, either as owner or employer, whether for hire or not, any of a list of specified gambling games, or any banking or percentage game played with cards, dice, or any device, for money, checks, credit, or any representative of value.
Existing law generally requires a person to be deemed unsuitable to hold a state gambling license under the California Gambling Control Act to own a gambling establishment if the person, or any partner, officer, director, or shareholder of that person, has any financial interest in any business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, whether within or without this state. Existing law exempts from these provisions a person who meets specified criteria, including a person who is licensed or had an application to be licensed on file with the commission on or before February 1, 2013. Existing law requires a person exempt under this provision, within 3 years of the date the closed business or organization reopens or becomes engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, to either divest that person’s interest in the business or organization or divest that person’s interest in the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment for which the person is licensed or has applied to be licensed by the commission.
During this 3-year divestment period, existing law makes it unlawful for any cross-promotion or marketing, as defined, to occur between the business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, and a gambling enterprise or gambling establishment.
This bill would instead require an exempt person, within 6 years of the date the closed business or organization reopens or becomes engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, to either divest that person’s interest in the business or organization or divest that person’s interest in the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment for which the person is licensed or has applied to be licensed by the commission. The bill would also make conforming changes. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the City of Inglewood, by July 1, 2018, to prepare and submit a report to the Legislature and appropriate policy committees of the Legislature on the progress of the construction of the City of Champions Revitalization Project and its impact on the divestment requirement described above. By imposing a reporting requirement on the City of Inglewood, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Inglewood.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Sections 19855 and 19858 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to gambling."

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), the Department of Food and Agriculture may approve not more than three satellite wagering facilities that are licensed jointly to the 1a District Agricultural Association and the 5th District Agricultural Association and that are located on the fairgrounds of the 1a District Agricultural Association or within the boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco. Before a satellite wagering facility may be licensed for the 1997 and subsequent calendar years under this subdivision, the department shall conduct a one-year test at the proposed site in order to determine the impact of the proposed facility on total state parimutuel revenues and on attendance and wagering at existing racetracks and fair satellite wagering facilities in the Counties of Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Solano.

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) There is statewide interest in preventing homes, neighborhoods, commercial properties, and public ways from deteriorating and falling into disrepair creating blight conditions.
(2) Blight adversely impacts community quality-of-life issues, creates hazards and unsafe conditions that endanger the public, causes citizen dissatisfaction, and leads to dangerous buildings, increased crime, and reduced property values.
(3) Setting the standards, minimum requirements, and ongoing educational requirements for local code enforcement officers who elect to attain the Certified Code Enforcement Officer title helps local agencies identify, select, and train qualified public officers to enforce laws and codes necessary to help preserve safe, well-ordered communities.
(4) Public officers who perform code enforcement functions require a unique skill set that is not available through traditional vocational offerings.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this measure to protect human safety, preserve property values, reduce crime, and abate public nuisances by helping to regulate the standard of training and certification for local code enforcement officers that public agencies may rely on. The municipal code enforcement function is sufficiently important to justify having a standard by public authority, with the title Certified Code Enforcement Officer having a legally defined meaning.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that compliance with this measure be voluntary and not to mandate local agencies or employers to require their code enforcement officers to become certified. The voluntary program created pursuant to this measure will ensure that individuals who are Certified Code Enforcement Officers have met prescribed education, training, and experience requirements and have passed a comprehensive examination reflective of the demands encountered in the code enforcement profession.
(d) It is the intent of the Legislature to recognize the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers professional development and credentialing program by establishing a Certified Code Enforcement Officer title to help local agencies define, standardize, and regulate this important function.
SEC. 2.
Chapter 20 (commencing with Section 26205) is added to Division 20 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
CHAPTER  20. Certified Code Enforcement Officers
26205.
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Code Enforcement Officer Standards Act.
26206.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Board” means the duly elected Board of Directors of the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers.
(b) “CACEO” means the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers, a public benefit corporation domiciled in California.
(c) “Certified Code Enforcement Officer” or “CCEO” means a person registered or certified as described in this chapter.
(d) “Code enforcement officer” has the same meaning as defined in Section 829.5 of the Penal Code.
26207.
(a) The board shall develop and maintain standards for the various classes of CCEOs that it designates. The standards for education, training, and certification shall be adopted by administrative rule of the board, and they shall be no less than as described in this chapter. CCEOs shall not have the power of arrest except as authorized by the city, county, or city and county charter, code, or regulation in which they operate. CCEOs shall not have access to summary criminal history information pursuant to this section, but persons regularly employed by a city, county, or city and county designated pursuant to this subdivision may be furnished state summary criminal history information upon a showing of compelling need pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 11105 of the Penal Code if the criteria specified in that section is otherwise met. A person may not be designated or certified as a CCEO under this section if that person is disqualified pursuant to the criteria set forth in Section 1029 of the Government Code.
(b) The board shall review all applications from cities, counties, cities and counties, and accredited educational institutions who seek to develop and provide education designed to qualify their students, participants, or employees as CCEOs. All applications that are submitted on approved forms that, subject to the board’s review and approval, demonstrate the equivalency of the standards adopted under the rules of the board shall qualify as Certified Code Enforcement Officer Education Program Providers (program providers). All program providers are subject to ongoing program review and evaluation under the board’s administrative rules. A program provider shall renew its program provider application and obtain approval under the board’s administrative rules no later than 36 months from the date of the last approval or else it shall lapse and be subject to renewal under the board’s administrative rules. All students, participants, or employees who successfully pass the minimum education and certification requirements of the program providers approved curriculum shall, subject to the same fees as other registered CCEOs under the board’s administrative rules, be granted status as CCEOs in an equivalent manner as applicants who attained certification or registration status through the CACEO educational and certification programs and academies.
(c) The development and perpetual advancement of code enforcement officer professional standards and actively providing related educational offerings that lead to increased professional competence and ethical behavior shall be the highest priority for the board in its licensing, certification, and disciplinary functions. Whenever the advancement of code enforcement officer professional standards and the provision of related educational offerings is inconsistent with other interests sought to be promoted, the former shall be paramount.
26208.
The board’s administrative rules shall designate minimum training, qualifications, and experience requirements for applicants to qualify for the CCEO designation, including, but not limited to, training and competency requirements in the areas of land use and zoning laws, health and safety codes, substandard housing abatement, environmental regulations, sign standards, public nuisance laws, applicable constitutional law, investigation and enforcement techniques, application of remedies, officer safety, and community engagement. The board may, by administrative rule, designate additional classes of certifications to help meet its mission.
26209.
The board shall conspicuously and continually publish its list of CCEOs on the CACEO Internet Web site, containing the registrant’s full name, summary status as to individual disciplinary concerns, active or inactive status, date of active CCEO expiration, and business address, unless the business address is a residence, which shall be treated as confidential.
26210.
A CCEO shall hold a valid certificate designating the person as a CCEO issued by the CACEO, shall at all times remain a member in good standing of the CACEO, and shall be subject to ongoing continuing education and registration requirements as designated by the board’s administrative rules.
26211.
Failure to maintain the continuing education requirements shall cause the certification status to lapse, subject to redemption as specified by the board’s administrative rules. Once a certification lapses, the certification status shall automatically convert to inactive CCEO status unless it is redeemed. The rights, privileges, and procedures or limitations on redemption of inactive CCEOs shall be specified in the board’s administrative rules.
26212.
The board shall annually set fees in amounts that are reasonably related and necessary to cover the cost of administering this chapter. The fees shall be set by the board and published on the CACEO Internet Web site and maintained at the CACEO’s headquarters.
26213.
The board shall maintain a register of each application for a certificate of registration under this chapter. The register shall include all of the following:
(a) The name, residence, date of birth, and driver’s license number (including state or country of origin) of the applicant.
(b) The name and address of the employer or business of the applicant.
(c) The date of the application.
(d) The education and experience qualifications of the applicant.
(e) The action taken by the board regarding the application and the date of the action.
(f) The serial number of any certificate of registration issued to an applicant.
(g) Any other information required by board rule.
26214.
A person may not hold himself or herself out to be a Certified Code Enforcement Officer in this state or use the title “Certified Code Enforcement Officer” in this state unless the person holds a certificate of registration pursuant to this chapter.
26215.
The board shall, by administrative rule, create a process to timely consider and review all applicants who hold certification from any other agency, and allow them to seek review and potential approval of the qualifications to potentially be recognized as a CCEO in this state. A denial of full recognition as a CCEO shall be accompanied by written justification and a list of required steps that may be required for the individual applicant to complete the registration and certification process. Recognition fees shall be set as described in Section 26212.
26216.
(a) The board shall adopt administrative rules to process information, investigate allegations or suspicions of applicants or licensees providing false information, failing to disclose material information on the registration application, or not providing any information that may, either before or during the certification process, disqualify the applicant or certificant under subdivision (a) of Section 26207. The board shall adopt procedures and guidelines to impose any discipline, revocation of certification, or sanction, for cause, against any applicant, registrant, or certificant.
(b) The administrative rules shall provide the applicant or registrant with adequate and fair notice and hearing opportunities prior to the board taking any adverse action against the applicant or certificant.
(c) Any factual finding after a hearing that the board concludes is cause for revocation, suspension, or other disciplinary or administrative action against a registration or certification shall result in an order after hearing that meets the fair notification requirements of this section.
(d) All orders after hearing shall be deemed final under the board’s authority and procedures and may be appealed as provided for in Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
26217.
This chapter shall not be construed to duplicate, overlap, or otherwise conflict with the certification and continuing education requirements for construction inspectors, plans examiners, and building officials established pursuant to Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 18949.25) of Part 2.5 of Division 13.","Existing law defines the term “code enforcement officer” as a person who is not a peace officer, who has enforcement authority for health, safety, and welfare requirements, and who is authorized to issue citations or file formal complaints, as specified.
This bill would require the Board of Directors of the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers (CACEO) to develop and maintain standards for the designation of Certified Code Enforcement Officers or CCEOs. The bill would require the board to designate minimum training, qualifications, and experience requirements for applicants to qualify for the CCEO designation. The bill would also require the board to qualify cities, counties, cities and counties, and accredited educational institutions as Certified Code Enforcement Officer Education Program Providers, and would require all students, participants, or employees who successfully pass the minimum education and certification requirements to be granted CCEO status in an equivalent manner as applicants who attain certification through the CACEO.
The bill would require the board to set annual fees in amounts that are reasonably related and necessary to cover the costs of administering these provisions, to maintain a register of applications for certification, and adopt procedures for discipline, revocation, and sanctions against applicants, registrants, and certificants. The bill would allow all orders of the board resulting in revocation, suspension, or other action to be appealed by a writ of mandate or petition for judicial review to the superior court.","An act to add Chapter 20 (commencing with Section 26205) to Division 20 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to code enforcement officers."

(f) Court records of the appellate division of the superior court: retain for five years.
(g) Other records:
(1) Bench warrant: retain for the same retention period as for records in the underlying case.

If there is no return on the warrant, the court may dismiss on its own motion and immediately destroy the records.
(2) Body attachment: retain for same retention period as for records in the underlying case.
(3) Bond: retain for three years after exoneration and release.
(4) Court reporter notes:
(A) Criminal and juvenile proceedings: retain notes for 10 years, except as otherwise specified.

(i) The record retention periods provided in this section, as amended effective January 1, 2014, apply to all court records in existence prior to that date as well as to records created on or after that date.","Existing law authorizes the trial court clerk to destroy court records, as defined, after notice of destruction, if there is no request and order for transfer of the records, upon the expiration of specified time periods after final disposition of the case. Existing law generally provides that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation may be destroyed after 5 years, but that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation for speed contests, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or driving under the influence and causing bodily injury, may be destroyed after 10 years.
This bill would decrease the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for speed contests must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 10 years to 5 years. The bill would increase the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for reckless driving must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 5 years to 10 years.","An act to amend Section 68152 of the Government Code, relating to court records."

Section 1682 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
1682.
In addition to other acts constituting unprofessional conduct under this chapter, it is unprofessional conduct for:
(a) Any dentist performing dental procedures to have more than one patient undergoing conscious sedation or general anesthesia on an outpatient basis at any given time unless each patient is being continuously monitored on a one-to-one ratio while sedated by either the dentist or another licensed health professional authorized by law to administer conscious sedation or general anesthesia.
(b) Any dentist with patients recovering from conscious sedation or general anesthesia to fail to have the patients closely monitored by licensed health professionals experienced in the care and resuscitation of patients recovering from conscious sedation or general anesthesia. If one licensed professional is responsible for the recovery care of more than one patient at a time, all of the patients shall be physically in the same room to allow continuous visual contact with all patients and the patient to recovery staff ratio should not exceed three to one.
(c) Any dentist with patients who are undergoing conscious sedation to fail to have these patients continuously monitored during the dental procedure with a pulse oximeter or similar or superior monitoring equipment required by the board.
(d) Any dentist with patients who are undergoing conscious sedation to have dental office personnel directly involved with the care of those patients who are not certified in basic cardiac life support (CPR) and recertified biennially.
(e) (1) Any dentist to fail to obtain the written informed consent of a patient prior to administering general anesthesia or conscious sedation. In the case of a minor, the consent shall be obtained from the child’s parent or guardian.
(2) The written informed consent, in the case of a minor, shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:
“The administration and monitoring of general anesthesia may vary depending on the type of procedure, the type of practitioner, the age and health of the patient, and the setting in which anesthesia is provided. Risks may vary with each specific situation. You are encouraged to explore all the options available for your child’s anesthesia for his or her dental treatment, and consult with your dentist or pediatrician as needed.”
(3) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to establish the reasonable standard of care for administering or monitoring oral conscious sedation, conscious sedation, or general anesthesia.","The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists by the Dental Board of California. That act authorizes a committee of the board to evaluate all suggestions or requests for regulatory changes related to the committee and to hold informational hearings in order to report and make appropriate recommendations to the board, after consultation with departmental legal counsel and the board’s chief executive officer. The act requires a committee to include in any report regarding a proposed regulatory change, at a minimum, the specific language or the proposed change or changes and the reasons therefor, and any facts supporting the need for the change.
The act governs the use of general anesthesia, conscious sedation, and oral conscious sedation for pediatric and adult patients. The act makes it unprofessional conduct for a licensee to fail to report the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, that is related to a dental procedure, as specified. The act also makes it unprofessional conduct for any dentist to fail to obtain the written informed consent of a patient prior to administering general anesthesia or conscious sedation. In the case of a minor, the act requires that the consent be obtained from the child’s parent or guardian.
This bill, which would be known as “Caleb’s Law,” would require the board, on or before January 1, 2017, to provide to the Legislature a report on whether current statutes and regulations for the administration and monitoring of pediatric anesthesia in dentistry provide adequate protection for pediatric dental patients and would require the board to make the report publicly available on the board’s Internet Web site. The bill also would require the board to provide a report on pediatric deaths related to general anesthesia in dentistry at the time of its sunset review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.
This bill would require that the report of the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, be on a form or forms approved by the board and that the report include specified information. The bill authorizes the board to assess a penalty on any licensee who fails to make the required report.
This bill, with regard to obtaining written informed consent for general anesthesia or conscious sedation in the case of a minor, would require that the written informed consent include specified information regarding anesthesia, as provided.","An act to amend Sections 1680 and 1682 of, and to add Section 1601.4 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to healing arts."

SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Heritage Protection Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) National, state, and regional parks serve the public interest, benefit California, and very often reflect historic significance that earlier generations of Californians have attached to these sites.
(b) Yosemite National Park, located in California, is one of the most important and majestic parks in the United States and is filled with historic landmarks built several decades ago. The historic nature of these landmarks as California heirloom destinations is demonstrated by topographic maps of the Yosemite Valley, dating back to the 1950s, which include these venues.
(c) The Ahwahnee Hotel was built in the 1920s with a backdrop of Half Dome. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.
(d) Curry Village, in the Yosemite Valley, is named after a San Francisco Bay area couple who established a summer camp there in 1899. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
(e) The Wawona Hotel is a complex of seven buildings in the southwest corner of Yosemite National Park. The first building, then named “Long White,” was originally constructed in 1876. The main hotel building originally opened in 1879. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
(f) California state park venues are held in public trust for the people of California. A legal claim by an individual to have a trademark right to a name or names associated with a venue within a state park derogates the interests of California and the shared history of Californians, and it is indicative of a lack of the individual’s fitness to serve as a steward of the state’s cherished cultural heritage and places.
(g) An agreement entered into by any California state agency that compromises the interests of Californians is “ultra vires” and therefore beyond that agency’s legal authority to enter.
(h) It is important that the Legislature clarify that an awarded concession contract within California’s state parks does not give the concessionaire a trademark right to the name or names associated with a state park venue or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources. Furthermore, a concessionaire who makes a legal claim to have that trademark right should be disqualified from further consideration as a bidder.

(b) “Best responsible bidder” means the bidder, as determined by specific standards established by the department, that, as determined by the department, will operate the concession (1) consistent with the contract, (2) in a manner fully compatible with, and complementary to, the characteristics, features, and theme of the unit in which the concession will be operated, (3) in the best interests of the state and public, and (4) in a manner that protects the state’s trademark and service mark rights in the names associated with a state park venue and its historical, cultural, and recreational resources. For purposes of this section, a bidder who would be subject to subdivision (b) of Section 5080.22 is not a best responsible bidder.

(a) (1) The maximum term shall be 10 years, except that a term of more than 10 years may be provided if the director determines that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to amortize improvements made by the concessionaire, to facilitate the full utilization of a structure that is scheduled by the department for replacement or redevelopment, or to serve the best interests of the state. The term shall not exceed 20 years without specific authorization by statute. Except as provided in Section 5080.16, all renewals of concession contracts pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to competitive bidding requirements.
(2) The maximum term shall be 50 years if the concession contract is for the construction, development, and operation of multiple-unit lodging facilities equipped with full amenities, including plumbing and electrical, that is anticipated to exceed an initial cost of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) in capital improvements in order to begin operation. The term for a concession contract described in this paragraph shall not exceed 50 years without specific authorization by statute. Except as provided in Section 5080.16, all renewals of concession contracts pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to competitive bidding requirements.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a concession agreement at Will Rogers State Beach executed prior to December 31, 1997, including, but not limited to, an agreement signed pursuant to Section 25907 of the Government Code, may be extended to exceed 20 years in total length without specific authorization by statute, upon approval by the director and pursuant to a determination by the director that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to amortize improvements made by the concessionaire that are anticipated to exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) in capital improvements. Any extensions granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be for more than 15 years.
(b) Every concessionaire shall submit to the department all sales and use tax returns and, at the request of the department, provide an annual financial statement prepared or audited by a certified public accountant.
(c) Every concession shall be subject to audit by the department.
(d) A performance bond shall be obtained and maintained by the concessionaire. In lieu of a bond, the concessionaire may substitute a deposit of funds acceptable to the department. Interest on the deposit shall accrue to the concessionaire.
(e) The concessionaire shall obtain and maintain in force at all times a policy of liability insurance in an amount adequate for the nature and extent of public usage of the concession and naming the state as an additional insured.
(f) Any discrimination by the concessionaire or his or her agents or employees against any person because of the marital status or ancestry of that person or any characteristic listed or defined in Section 11135 of the Government Code is prohibited.
(g) To be effective, any modification of the concession contract shall be evidenced in writing.
(h) Whenever a concession contract is terminated for substantial breach, there shall be no obligation on the part of the state to purchase any improvements made by the concessionaire.
(i) If a concessionaire makes a legal claim or assertion to have a trademark or service mark interest in violation of subdivision (a) of Section 5080.22, the concessionaire shall forfeit the right to bid on future state park concession contracts to the extent authorized by federal law.
(j) If a current or former concessionaire in bad faith files a federal or state trademark or service mark application for a trademark or service mark that incorporates or implies an association with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and the state files a successful opposition or cancellation with respect to that trademark or service mark application, the concessionaire shall be responsible for the state’s attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with that opposition or cancellation.

Section 4.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code proposed by both this bill and Senate Bill 1473. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 1473, in which case Section 4 of this bill shall not become operative.","Existing law establishes the Department of Parks and Recreation and vests the department with the control of the state park system. Existing law authorizes the Director of Parks and Recreation to negotiate or renegotiate a concession contract within state parks if specified conditions exist and generally requires that a concession contract within state parks for a period of more than 2 years be awarded to the best responsible bidder.
This bill would enact the California Heritage Protection Act, which would make various changes to the process for negotiating or renegotiating state parks concession contracts. The bill would modify the definition of a best responsible bidder to include that the bidder, among other things, will operate the concession in a manner that protects the state’s trademark and service mark interest in the names associated with a state park venue and its historical, cultural, and recreational resources.
This bill would prohibit a concession contract from providing a contracting party with a trademark or service mark interest in the name or names associated with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and would prohibit a concession contract from serving as the basis for any legal claim that the contracting party has that interest. The bill would declare that these provisions do not constitute a change in, but are declaratory of, existing law. The bill would prohibit a bidder who makes that legal claim or assertion, and a bidder who a court has determined has made that legal claim or assertion with respect to a state or federal park venue without reasonable cause and in bad faith, from being awarded a concession contract within state parks. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations to provide a bidder who is denied a contract award based on these reasons with written notice and an opportunity to rebut the basis of the contract denial at a formal hearing. The bill would render a provision of a concession contract that, on and after January 1, 2017, provides a contracting party with a trademark or service mark interest in the name or names associated with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, void and unenforceable.
This bill would require a concession contract to contain provisions requiring the concessionaire to forfeit the right to bid on future state park concession contracts if the concessionaire makes the above-described legal claim or assertion and requiring a concessionaire to be responsible for the state’s attorney fees, costs, and expenses if the concessionaire in bad faith files a federal or state trademark or service mark application for a trademark or service mark that incorporates or implies association with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and the state files a successful opposition or cancellation of the trademark or service mark application.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code proposed by SB 1473 to be operative only if SB 1473 and this bill are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","An act to amend Sections 5080.05 and 5080.18 of, and to add Section 5080.22 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to state parks."

(2) A legislative body as that term is defined by subdivision (b) of Section 54952, if the members of the legislative body are compensated for their appearance, and if one or more of the members of the legislative body are also members of a legislative body as that term is defined by subdivision (a) of Section 54952.

The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 54954.2 of the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
It is in the public interest to ensure that members of the public can easily and quickly find and access meeting agendas of legislative bodies of specific local agencies on the Internet homepage of those certain local agencies.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.","(1) The Ralph M. Brown Act requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a legislative body of a local agency, as those terms are defined, be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend and participate. The act further requires the legislative body of a local agency to post, at least 72 hours before the meeting, an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at a regular meeting, in a location that is freely accessible to members of the public and to provide a notice containing similar information with respect to a special meeting at least 24 hours prior to the special meeting. The act requires that the agenda or notice be freely accessible to members of the public and be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site, if the local agency has one.
This bill would require an online posting of an agenda for a meeting occurring on and after January 1, 2019, of a legislative body of a city, county, city and county, special district, school district, or political subdivision established by the state that has an Internet Web site to be posted on the local agency’s primary Internet Web site homepage accessible through a prominent, direct link, as specified. The bill would exempt a legislative body of a city, county, city and county, special district, school district, or political subdivision established by the state that has an Internet Web site from this requirement if it has an integrated agenda management platform that meets specified requirements, including, among others, that the current agenda is the first agenda available at the top of the integrated agenda management platform. The bill would authorize an integrated agenda management platform to include prior meeting agendas, as specified. The bill would require any agenda posted pursuant to these provisions to be in an open format that meets specified requirements, including, among others, that the agenda is platform independent and machine readable. The bill would also define terms for these purposes.
(2) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 54954.2 of the Government Code, relating to local government."

SECTION 1.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Mental Health Justice Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Exposure to violence increases the risk of developing a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children in underserved communities are more likely to be exposed to violence than other children.
(b) Ten times as many people with mental illness are in prisons and jails today than are in mental health treatment facilities.
(c) Correctional facilities spend two to three times more money on adults with mental illnesses than they do on people who do not live with a mental illness.
(d) Despite overall decreasing prison populations, California’s prisons are experiencing increasing demand for mental health treatment services as prison inmates require mental health treatment at higher rates. This number is anticipated to continue to increase in the next five years and beyond.
(e) In California, the annual prison cost for an inmate in the general population is $51,000, while the annual community housing and outpatient treatment costs for a person with mental illness are 60 percent less at $20,412.
(f) Nearly half of all prisoners in California are mentally ill and have received psychiatric treatment within the past year. This number has almost doubled in the last 15 years, making jails and prisons the de facto mental health system.
(g) Individuals with mental illnesses tend to stay longer in prison or jail and, when released, are at a higher risk of returning to prison or jail than those without these illnesses.
(h) Mental health court participants have a significantly lower (47 percent) recidivism rate compared to similar defendants in traditional court.
(i) Mental health courts allow for the consideration of a defendant’s mental health status during court proceedings and have shown to save $7 in costs for every $1 spent.
(j) According to the United States Supreme Court, conditions in California prisons exacerbate mental health issues significantly. Offenders with mental illness are often subjected to higher rates of physical and sexual trauma, forced restraints, solitary confinement, and overmedication while incarcerated. Those who are kept in isolation are at higher risk for psychiatric injury, self-harm, and suicide.
(k) A defendant’s mental illness should inform case processing and the nature of any criminal charges, in alignment with public safety and a defendant’s constitutional rights.
(l) California must increase diversion programs to redirect defendants with mental illness away from prisons and jails, which exacerbate mental illnesses, impede treatment, and increase costs, and toward proven mental health treatment services.

(a)If a defendant has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been convicted of, an offense that will result in a sentence to state prison or county jail, the defendant or the prosecutor may submit evidence that the defendant suffers from a diagnosable mental illness that was a substantial factor that contributed to the defendant’s criminal conduct. The evidence shall be filed after the defendant’s plea or conviction, but before his or her sentencing.
(b)If evidence is submitted pursuant to subdivision (a), the court shall consider that evidence in conjunction with the defendant’s sentencing.
(c)Upon consideration of the evidence submitted pursuant to subdivision (a), notwithstanding any other law, if the court determines that it is in the best interests of public safety, the court may order one or more of the following:
(1)(A)That the defendant serve, if the defendant agrees, all or a part of his or her sentence in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of in the state prison or county jail, unless that placement would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.

(2)The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, to place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail system, respectively, at a level of care determined to be appropriate by the department’s mental health staff or county mental health staff, within 30 days, of the defendant’s placement in the state prison or county jail.
(3)The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the county jail authority, as applicable, regardless of the type of crime committed to prepare a postrelease mental health treatment plan six months prior to the defendant’s release to parole or postrelease community supervision.

(a) A defendant who has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to, or was convicted of, a felony or misdemeanor and who currently is, or at any prior time was, eligible for public mental health services due to serious mental illness or who currently is, or at any prior time was, eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits due to a diagnosed mental illness may petition the court for a sentence that includes mental health treatment. The petition shall be filed after the defendant’s plea or conviction, but before his or her sentencing.
(b) The defendant shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she meets the criteria in subdivision (a).
(c) If the court determines that the defendant has met his or her burden, as described in subdivision (b), and that it is in the public interest, the court may order that the defendant’s sentence include one or more of the following:
(1) (A) A requirement that the defendant serve, if the defendant agrees, all or a part of his or her sentence in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of in the state prison or a county jail, if that placement would not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety and is in the interest of justice pursuant to Section 1385.
(B) A defendant is not eligible for subparagraph (A) if his or her current plea or conviction is for a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, or if the defendant is required by statute to serve his or her entire sentence only in state prison.
(2) Regardless of the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty or nolo contendere or for which the defendant was convicted, a requirement that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail system at a level of care determined to be appropriate by the department’s mental health staff or county mental health staff, within 30 days of the defendant’s sentencing.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law prohibits a person from being tried, adjudged to punishment, or having his or her probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole revoked while that person is mentally incompetent. Existing law establishes a process by which a defendant’s mental competency is evaluated and by which the defendant receives treatment, including, if applicable, antipsychotic medication, with the goal of returning the defendant to competency. Existing law credits time spent by a defendant in a state hospital or other facility as a result of commitment during the process toward the term of any imprisonment for which the defendant is sentenced.
Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, prohibits certain recidivist offenders from being committed to any facility other than a state prison.
This bill would authorize, if a defendant has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been convicted of, an offense that will result in a sentence to state prison or county jail, the defendant or the prosecutor submit evidence that the defendant suffers from a diagnosable mental condition that was a substantial factor that contributed to the defendant’s criminal conduct. The bill would require that the evidence be submitted after the defendant’s conviction, but before his or her sentencing. The bill would require the court to consider any evidence submitted as described above in conjunction with the defendant’s sentencing, and would authorize the court to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, to place the defendant in a residential mental health treatment facility. This placement would not be available to a defendant who is subject to the Three Strikes Law. The bill would also authorize the court to order the department or jail authority to place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, respectively. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings.
This bill would authorize a defendant who is or has been eligible for public mental health services due to a serious mental illness or who is eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits due to a diagnosed mental illness to petition the court, after the defendant’s plea or conviction but prior to sentencing, for a sentence that includes mental health treatment. The bill would authorize a court, if it finds that the defendant has shown that he or she meets the criteria by a preponderance of the evidence, to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the county authority to provide specified mental health service, including placement in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of state prison or county jail, placement in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, or preparation of a postrelease mental health treatment plan. The bill would authorize the court, upon petition of the defendant or the prosecution, to recall a sentence that includes a mental health order and resentence the defendant to other mental health treatment or resentence the defendant without mental health treatment. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings.
By imposing additional duties upon county jail authorities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(2) “Electrocautery device” means a device that is electrically heated to cut, ablate, or coagulate human tissue for therapeutic purposes.
(3) “Electrosurgical device” means a device that uses a radio frequency electric current passing through the patient to cut, ablate, or coagulate human tissue for therapeutic purposes.
(4) “Energy-based device” means a device that uses energy to ablate, cauterize, or mechanically manipulate target human tissue including lasers, electrosurgical generators, broadband light sources, ultrasonic instruments, plasma generators, bone saws, and drills.
(5) “Health facility” means a health facility as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code.

(7) “Plume scavenging system” means smoke evacuators, laser plume evacuators, plume scavengers, and local exhaust ventilators that capture and neutralize plume at the site of origin and before plume can make ocular contact or contact with the respiratory tract of employees.
(b) (1) The division, by June 1, 2017, shall convene an advisory committee to develop a regulation that requires a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume. The advisory committee may include health facilities, practicing physicians and surgeons from affected specialties, registered nurses and other affected health care personnel, labor and specialty organizations representing affected registered nurses, labor and specialty organizations representing other affected health care personnel, and other stakeholders.
(2) By June 1, 2018, the division shall submit to the board the proposed regulation requiring a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume.
(3) In developing the regulation, the division shall do all of the following:
(A) Evaluate using as a benchmark the standards titled “Systems for evacuation of plume generated by medical devices” (ISO 16571) adopted by the International Organization for Standardization and the standards titled “Plume scavenging in surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and aesthetic settings” (CSA Z305.13-13) adopted by the CSA Group.
(B) Take into consideration recommendations on the evacuation of plume from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

(D) Include a requirement in the regulation for employers to provide training to all workers foreseeably participating in procedures that involve the creation of plume. The training shall include, but not be limited to, general education on the contents of plume, the circumstances in which it is generated, the associated health and safety hazards, and appropriate use of the plume scavenging equipment and systems utilized by the health facility. The training shall be designed to provide an opportunity for interactive questions and answers with a person knowledgeable about occupational exposure to plume and the specific equipment utilized to scavenge plume.
(c) The board shall, by July 1, 2019, adopt the proposed regulation of the division, except as specified in subdivision (f), requiring a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume.

SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board within the Department of Industrial Relations promulgates and enforces occupational safety and health standards for the state, including standards dealing with toxic materials and harmful physical agents. Under existing law, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health is required to enforce all occupational safety and health standards, as specified. A violation of these standards and regulations under specific circumstances is a crime.
This bill would, by June 1, 2017, require the division to convene an advisory committee to develop a regulation that requires a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume and would authorize certain entities and people to be on the advisory committee, including, among others, practicing physicians and surgeons from affected specialties. The bill would require the division, in developing the regulation to do certain things, including evaluating the use of certain standards adopted by specified organizations as a benchmark. The bill would also require the division, when developing the proposed regulation, to take into consideration recommendations on the evacuation of plume from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The bill would, by June 1, 2018, require the division to submit to the board the proposed regulation. The bill would, by July 1, 2019, require the board to adopt the proposed regulation.
The bill would provide that compliance with general room ventilation standards or the use of surgical masks does not satisfy the requirements for protection from surgical plumes under these provisions. The bill would provide that the use of respirators does not satisfy the requirements for protection from surgical plumes under these provisions, except as specified. The bill would require the manufacturer of a plume scavenging system to provide evidence that the system meets specified minimum requirements when installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The bill would specify that these provisions do not limit the authority of the division to develop, or limit the authority of the board to adopt, a regulation with a broader scope or broader application than required by these provisions.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 144.9 to the Labor Code, relating to occupational safety and health."

Section 15100 of the Financial Code is amended to read:
15100.
(a) The board of directors shall establish written policies which shall set forth the policies of the credit union with respect to any obligation that is offered to the members of the credit union. The written policies shall set forth the maximum amounts and terms for any obligation offered to the members, including, but not limited to, the following information:
(1) For loans, the written policies shall set out the terms for unsecured loans, the maximum amount and terms for secured loans, the schedule of interest rates established pursuant to Section 15000 for each type or class of unsecured and secured loan offered to members, the maximum maturity for any loan, or, in the case of an open-end loan, the rate of repayment for any type or class of open-end loan, the limitations, if any, which shall be placed on the authority of any loan officer appointed pursuant to Sections 14602 and 14603, and, subject to the provisions of subdivisions (b) and (c), the individual limits on obligations that are applicable to all members of the credit union.

For purposes of this article, “family” means the marital couple or any head of household together with those dependents residing with the marital couple or the head of household and those dependents attending school away from the principal residence of the marital couple or head of household.","(1) The California Credit Union Law provides for the regulation of credit unions within the state by the Commissioner of Business Oversight. The law requires a credit union to be directed by a board of directors consisting of an odd number of directors, at least 5 in number, each of whom are a member of the credit union, to be elected by the members at their annual meeting. The law requires a credit union to have a supervisory committee of at least 3 persons, each of whom is a member of the credit union. The law authorizes the directors to delegate the approval of applications for new memberships to any officer, director, committee member, or employee pursuant to a written membership plan adopted by the board, provided the board reviews, at least quarterly, a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee.
This bill would require the board to meet on a regular basis, not less than quarterly, as reasonably determined by the board. The bill would require the membership of the supervisory committee to be an odd number and would authorize, in lieu of the requirement for a supervisory committee, the establishment of an audit committee and the selection of the members of the audit committee. The bill would remove the requirement for the directors to, at least quarterly, review a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee to whom the directors delegated the authority to approve applications for new membership.
(2) The California Credit Union Law prohibits an obligation with a member that is not a natural person and results in liability to the credit union in excess of that member’s investment in the credit union unless an exception is authorized in the credit union’s bylaws and approved by the commissioner. The law authorizes any lending activity permitted pursuant to this provision to be terminated by the commissioner pursuant to a specific procedure.
This bill would repeal this prohibition.
(3) The California Credit Union Law limits the circumstances when a nonmember may participate in an obligation or extension of credit to a member as a joint applicant or co-obligor.
This bill would include the terms coborrower, surety, and guarantor within these provisions.
(4) The California Credit Union Law limits a credit union from entering, directly or indirectly, into any obligation with an official, and defines that term to mean a director, officer, member of the supervisory committee, or member of the credit committee of a credit union.
This bill would modify that definition to remove the position of an officer, and to include the positions of a member of the audit committee, credit manager, president, and chief executive officer of a credit union.
(5) The California Credit Union Law requires any application for any loan or extension or guarantee of credit, except as specified, to state in writing the purpose for which the loan or extension or guarantee of credit is desired, and, if applicable, describe the property that is proposed to secure the loan or extension or guarantee of credit.
This bill would repeal this requirement.","An act to amend Sections 14103, 14252, 14453, 14456, 14550, 14804, 14950, 15050, and 15100 of, to add Section 14556 to, and to repeal Section 14951 of, the Financial Code, relating to credit unions."

(b) Expenses for which reimbursement is required pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be paid from the former officeholder’s surplus campaign funds, as defined by Section 89519 of the Government Code, to the extent he or she has funds available to do so; however, if a former officeholder violates subdivision (c) of Section 89510 of the Government Code, he or she shall be personally liable for those expenses to the extent he or she lacks sufficient surplus campaign funds to pay them.
(c) If the legislative district encompasses more than one county, the surplus campaign funds shall be prorated among the counties conducting the special election in proportion to the percentage of the district each county composes.

SEC. 3.
Section 89519 of the Government Code is amended to read:
89519.
(a) Upon the 90th day after leaving an elective office, or the 90th day following the end of the postelection reporting period following the defeat of a candidate for elective office, whichever occurs last, campaign funds under the control of the former candidate or elected officer shall be considered surplus campaign funds and shall be disclosed pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 84100).

SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","The California Constitution requires the Governor to immediately call an election to fill a vacancy in the Legislature. Existing law provides specific procedures for the nomination and election of candidates at any special election to fill a vacancy in the office of State Senator or Member of the Assembly.
Exiting law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides that contributions deposited into a campaign account are deemed to be held in trust for expenses associated with the election of a candidate or for expenses associated with holding office. The act provides that campaign funds under the control of a former candidate or elected officer are considered surplus campaign funds at a prescribed time, and it prohibits the use of surplus campaign funds except for specified purposes.
This bill would prohibit a State Senator or Member of the Assembly who decides to resign from office before the expiration of his or her term from subsequently using campaign funds held in trust for any purpose other than paying outstanding campaign debts or reasonable expenses. The bill would amend the list of specified purposes allowable for the use of surplus campaign funds to include the payment of expenses to hold a special election to fill the vacancy created by the Member’s resignation and would require the former Member to pay from his or her surplus campaign funds such election-related expenses, to the extent he or she has funds available to do so. Once election-related expenses are paid, this bill would limit the use of excess surplus funds to
charitable
certain
purposes.
This bill would further make a Member who, after deciding to resign, uses campaign funds for purposes other than those authorized in that circumstance personally liable for expenses to hold a special election.
A violation of the provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974 is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","An act to add Section 10708 to the Elections Code, and to amend Sections 89510 and 89519 of the Government Code, relating to elections."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The state has a unique obligation to children and youth in the foster care system. When the state removes children and youth from their parents, it is responsible for providing for the safety and well-being of the children and youth and for preparing them for self-sufficient adulthood.
(b) Foster youth who leave the foster care system because of age face unique challenges in seeking and obtaining employment upon leaving the system. The foster care program provides little assistance to youth in finding employment.
(c) The unemployment rate for youth who have left the foster care system because of age is estimated at 50 percent.
(d) The state is a major employer within the state, yet state law makes no provision for assisting youth who have left the foster care system because of age in becoming civil service employees of the state.
(e) The state owes a unique responsibility to foster youth in assisting them to secure permanent employment. It also has an obligation to demonstrate to private employers, by example, the importance of hiring foster youth and former foster youth.

(5) The definition of “digital signature” in Section 16.5 of the Government Code and the definition of “electronic signature” in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act are similar, and neither statute includes any cross-reference to the other, leading to confusion in the marketplace and among public agencies as to what law governs.
(6) A lack of clarity in the law creates a barrier to public agencies utilizing fully digital transactions that require a signature, including contracts, permits, and forms to obtain service or participate in government programs. As a result, both government and the public may not realize the benefits of digital transactions and online services, including efficiency, cost savings, convenience, and paper reduction.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to amend current law to clarify that a “digital signature” authorized by Section 16.5 of the Government Code and subject to regulations adopted by the Secretary of State is one type of “electronic signature” that a public agency may choose to adopt under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

Existing provisions of the Government Code authorize the use of a digital signature in any written communication with a public entity, and specifies that in those communications, the use of a digital signature has the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature if it complies with specified requirements.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to clarify that a digital signature may be used to satisfy the requirements of an electronic signature under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. The bill would, for purposes of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, provide that an electronic signature includes a digital signature under the above described provisions of the Government Code and that a digital signature under those provisions is a type of an electronic signature as set forth in the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act. The bill would also revise the above-described provisions of the Government Code by specifying that if a public entity elects to use a digital signature, that meets specified requirements, the digital signature has the same force and effect of a manual signature in any communication with the public entity.","An act to amend Section 1633.2 of the Civil Code, and to amend Section 16.5 of the Government Code, relating to state government."

SEC. 3.
Section 186.35 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
186.35.
(a) A person who is listed by a law enforcement agency in a shared gang database as a gang member, suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate and who has contested his or her designation pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 186.34, may seek review within 90 calendar days of the agency’s mailing or personal service of the verification of the decision by filing an appeal to be heard by the superior court. A proceeding under this subdivision is a limited civil case. A copy of the notice of appeal shall be served in person or by first-class mail upon the agency by the person. For purposes of computing the 90-calendar-day period, Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable.
(b) The evidentiary record for the appeal shall be limited to the agency’s statement of basis of its designation made pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 186.34, and the documentation provided to the agency by the appellant pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 186.34. If, upon de novo review and any arguments presented to the court, the court finds that the law enforcement agency has failed to establish the petitioner’s active gang membership, associate status, or affiliate status by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall order the law enforcement agency to remove the name of the person from the shared gang database.
(c) The fee for filing the notice of appeal is as provided in Section 70615 of the Government Code. The court shall notify the person of the appearance date by mail or personal delivery. The court shall retain the fee under Section 70615 of the Government Code regardless of the outcome of the appeal.

SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (act), provides specified punishments for certain crimes committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal street gang, as specified. The act defines a “shared gang database” as having various attributes, including, among others, that the database contains personal, identifying information in which a person may be designated as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate, or for which entry of a person in the database reflects a designation of that person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate. Existing law requires a law enforcement agency, before designating a person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate in the database, to provide a written notice to the person’s parent or guardian, if the person is a minor.
This bill would require the notice described above to be provided to an adult before designating a person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate in the database. The bill would require these databases to comply with federal requirements regarding the privacy and accuracy of information in the database, and other operating principles for maintaining these databases. The bill would require local law enforcement, commencing January 15, 2018, and every January 15 thereafter to submit specified data pertaining to the database to the Department of Justice, and would require the Department of Justice, commencing February 15, 2018, and every February 15 thereafter, to post that information on the department’s Internet Web site.
By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would establish a procedure for a person designated in a shared gang database who has contested that designation with the local law enforcement agency and whose challenge has been denied to appeal to the superior court.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 70615 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 186.34 of, and to add Section 186.35 to, the Penal Code, relating to criminal gangs."

(b)
The California Water Action Plan calls for making improvements to the water transfer process as part of a comprehensive, long-term water management policy.
(c)
While numerous water agencies and water users currently participate in the water market, water transfer processes are complex and water market information may not be readily available to the public and all potential sellers and buyers.
(d)
Providing greater transparency in and access to water marketing will provide a needed tool to increase water supplies by leveraging significant local and regional investments made over the past two decades to increase water supply reliability.
(e)
An enhanced water market, used in conjunction with investments in conveyance, water use efficiency, including water conservation and water recycling, surface and groundwater storage, desalination, and other strategies, will add to the water supplies that are available to help the state weather multiple years of drought and protect economic and environmental uses of water.
(f)
Voluntary water transfers are a proven and effective way to help meet California’s water needs, as evidenced by the landmark 1991 Governor’s Emergency Drought Water Bank and numerous subsequent water banks, exchanges, and short- and long-term water transfers.
(g)
Water markets can improve water use efficiency and pricing, which in turn can contribute to increased water supply for consumptive uses, enhanced stream flows, and more water for wetlands and other environmental resources. This benefit would be of particular importance during prolonged drought.
(h)
Improving the water transfer process and enhancing access to water markets can accomplish all of the following:
(1) Protect existing local and regional investments.
(2)
Improve coordination among water agencies.
(3)
Incentivize significant investments in water use efficiency projects and programs.
(4)
Increase water supply and water supply reliability for urban and agricultural water users.

This bill would express the Legislature’s intent that juvenile court schools have a rigorous curriculum that includes a course of study that prepares pupils for high school graduation and career entry and fulfills the requirements for admission to the California State University and the University of California.
Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation, and authorizes the governing board of a school district to prescribe other coursework requirements that are in addition to the statewide requirements. Existing law exempts pupils in foster care and pupils who are homeless children or youths from local graduation requirements and also requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework satisfactorily completed by those pupils while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.
This bill would make that exemption and requirement to accept coursework satisfactorily completed applicable to former juvenile court school pupils, as defined. The bill would also require a county office of education to issue a diploma of graduation to a pupil who completes statewide coursework requirements for graduation while attending a juvenile court school but does not complete coursework and other requirements that are in addition to the statewide graduation requirements. By placing additional requirements on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain cidden"">

17406.
(a) (1) Notwithstanding Section 17417, the governing board of a school district may let, for a minimum rental of one dollar ($1) a year, to a person, firm, or corporation real property that belongs to the school district if the instrument by which this property is let requires the lessee therein to construct on the demised premises, or provide for the construction thereon of, a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term of the lease, and provides that title to that building shall vest in the school district at the expiration of that term. The instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the school district before the expiration of that term, and shall contain other terms and conditions as the governing board of the school district may deem to be in the best interest of the school district.
(2) An instrument created pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be awarded based on a competitive solicitation process to the proposer providing the best value to the school district, taking into consideration the proposer’s demonstrated competence and professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required. Before awarding an instrument pursuant to this section, the governing board of the school district shall adopt and publish required procedures and guidelines for evaluating the qualifications of proposers that ensure the best value selections by the school district are conducted in a fair and impartial manner. These procedures and guidelines shall be mandatory for the school district when awarding an instrument pursuant to this section. The required procedures shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(A) The school district shall prepare a request for sealed proposals from qualified proposers. The school district shall include in the request for sealed proposals an estimate of price of the project, a clear, precise description of any preconstruction services that may be required and the facilities to be constructed, the key elements of the instrument to be awarded, a description of the format that proposals shall follow and the elements they shall contain, the standards the school district will use in evaluating proposals, the date on which proposals are due, and the timetable the school district will follow in reviewing and evaluating proposals.
(B) The school district shall give notice of the request for sealed proposals in the manner of notice provided in Section 20112 of the Public Contract Code and in a trade paper of general circulation published in the county where the project is located, with the latest notice published at least 10 days before the date for receipt of the proposals.
(C) A proposer shall be prequalified in accordance with subdivisions (b) to (m), inclusive, of Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code in order to submit a proposal. If used, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors shall be subject to the same prequalification requirements for prospective bidders described in subdivisions (b) to (m), inclusive, of Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code, including the requirement for the completion and submission of a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial statement that is verified under oath and is not a public record. These prequalification requirements shall be included in an instrument created pursuant to paragraph (1).
(D) The request for sealed proposals shall identify all criteria that the school district will consider in evaluating the proposals and qualifications of the proposers, including relevant experience, safety record, price proposal, and other factors specified by the school district. The price proposal shall include, at the school district’s discretion, either a lump-sum price for the instrument to be awarded or the proposer’s proposed fee to perform the services requested, including the proposer’s proposed fee to perform preconstruction services or any other work related to the facilities to be constructed, as requested by the school district. The request for proposals shall specify whether each criterion will be evaluated pass-fail or will be scored as part of the best value score, and whether proposers must achieve any minimum qualification score for award of the instrument under this section.
(E) For each scored criterion, the school district shall identify the methodology and rating or weighting system that will be used by the school district in evaluating the criterion, including the weight assigned to the criterion and any minimum acceptable score.
(F) Proposals shall be evaluated and the instrument awarded under this section in the following manner:
(i) All proposals received shall be reviewed to determine those that meet the format requirements and the standards specified in the request for sealed proposals.
(ii) The school district shall evaluate the qualifications of the proposers based solely upon the criteria and evaluation methodology set forth in the request for sealed proposals, and shall assign a best value score to each proposal. Once the evaluation is complete, all responsive proposals shall be ranked from the highest best value to the lowest best value to the school district.
(iii) The award of the instrument shall be made by the governing board of the school district to the responsive proposer whose proposal is determined, in writing by the governing board of the school district, to be the best value to the school district.
(iv) If the selected proposer refuses or fails to execute the tendered instrument, the governing board of the school district may award the instrument to the proposer with the second highest best value score if the governing board of the school district deems it to be for the best interest of the school district. If the second selected proposer refuses or fails to execute the tendered instrument, the governing board of the school district may award the instrument to the proposer with the third highest best value score if the governing board of the school district deems it to be for the best interest of the school district.
(v) Notwithstanding any other law, upon issuance of a contract award, the school district shall publicly announce its award, identifying the entity to which the award is made, along with a statement regarding the basis of the award. The statement regarding the school district’s contract award and the contract file shall provide sufficient information to satisfy an external audit.
(G) The governing board of the school district, at its discretion, may reject all proposals and request new proposals.
(3) Following the award of an instrument created pursuant to paragraph (1), and if the price proposal is not a lump sum for the instrument awarded, the successful proposer shall provide the school district with objectively verifiable information of its costs to perform the services requested under the instrument and shall select subcontractors as set forth in paragraph (4). Once any preconstruction services are completed and subcontractors are selected, and upon approval of the plans and specifications for work on the site by the Department of General Services’ Division of the State Architect, if required, the successful proposer and the school district shall finalize the price for the services to be provided under the instrument. The successful proposer shall provide the school district with written rationale for the price, and the school district shall approve or reject the final price at a public meeting before the successful proposer may proceed with any further work under the instrument. The contract file shall include documentation sufficient to support the final price determination.
(4) (A) The school district, in the request for sealed proposals, may identify specific types of subcontractors that must be included in the proposal. All subcontractors that are identified in the proposal shall be afforded the protections of the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code).
(B) Following the award of an instrument created pursuant to paragraph (1) and for subcontractors not identified in the proposal, the successful proposer shall proceed as follows in awarding construction subcontracts with a value exceeding one-half of 1 percent of the price allocable to construction work:
(i) Provide public notice of availability of work to be subcontracted in accordance with the publication requirements applicable to the competitive bidding process of the school district, including a fixed date and time on which qualifications statements, bids, or proposals will be due.
(ii) Establish reasonable qualification criteria and standards.
(iii) Award the subcontract either on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder. The process may include prequalification or short-listing. The process shall not apply to subcontractors listed in the original proposal. Subcontractors awarded construction subcontracts under this subdivision shall be afforded all the protections of the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4100) of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code).
(5) Nothing in paragraph (2) shall preclude a school district from segregating the request for proposals into a request for qualifications, followed by a request for proposals with price information from the proposers deemed most qualified by the school district, provided that the procedures specified in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) are otherwise followed.
(b) (1) Notwithstanding Sections 17297 and 17402, for purposes of utilizing preconstruction services, a school district may enter into an instrument created pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) before written approval by the Department of General Services’ Division of the State Architect only if the instrument provides that no work for which a contractor is required to be licensed in accordance with Article 5 (commencing with Section 7065) of Chapter 9 of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code and for which Division of the State Architect approval is required can be performed before receipt of the required Division of the State Architect approval.
(2) Nothing in this subdivision waives the requirements of Section 17072.30 or Section 17074.16, or any other applicable requirements of Chapter 12.5 (commencing with Section 17070.10) of Part 10.
(c) A rental of property that complies with subdivision (a) as it reads on the day that the lease is entered into shall be deemed to have thereby required the payment of adequate consideration for purposes of Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(d) (1) This subdivision shall apply to a project for the construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of any structure, building, or other improvement of any kind that was leased through an instrument pursuant to this section before July 1, 2015. If at any time the instrument is determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because it fails to fall within the competitive bidding exception pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), as it read on December 31, 2016, the contractor who entered into the instrument with the school district may be paid the reasonable cost, specifically excluding profit, of the labor, equipment, materials, and services furnished by the contractor before the date of the determination that the instrument is invalid if all of the following conditions, as determined by the court, are met:
(A) The contractor proceeded with construction, alteration, repair, or improvement based upon a good faith belief that the instrument was valid.
(B) The school district has reasonably determined that the work performed is satisfactory.
(C) Contractor fraud did not occur in the obtaining or performance of the instrument.
(D) The instrument does not otherwise violate state law related to the construction or leasing of public works of improvement.
(2) In no event shall payment to the contractor pursuant to this section exceed either of the following:
(A) The contractor’s costs as included in the instrument plus the cost of any approved change orders.
(B) The lease payments made, less profit, at the point in time the instrument is determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this subdivision shall not affect any protest and legal proceedings, whether contractual, administrative, or judicial, to challenge the award of the public works contract, nor affect any rights under Section 337.1 or 337.15 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(e) This section shall become inoperative on July 1, 2022, and, as of January 1, 2023, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2023, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.

17406.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 17417, the governing board of a school district may let, for a minimum rental of one dollar ($1) a year, to any person, firm, or corporation any real property that belongs to the school district if the instrument by which this property is let requires the lessee to construct on the demised premises, or provide for the construction thereon of, a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term of the lease, and provides that title to that building shall vest in the school district at the expiration of that term. The instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the school district before the expiration of that term, and shall contain other terms and conditions as the governing board of the school district may deem to be in the best interest of the school district.
(b) Any rental of property that complies with subdivision (a) shall be deemed to have thereby required the payment of adequate consideration for purposes of Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(c) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2022.","Existing law requires the governing board of a school district to adopt a resolution that, among other things: (1) declares its intention to enter into a lease or agreement relating to school property, (2) includes specified information about the property, and (3) fixes a time for a public meeting of the governing board of the school district at which sealed proposals to enter a lease or agreement with the school district will be received from any person, firm, or corporation, and considered by the governing board of the school district, as specified.
Existing law, notwithstanding the provision described above, also authorizes the governing board of a school district, without advertising for bids, to lease real property for a minimum rental of $1 per year if the instrument by which this property is leased requires the lessee to construct, or provide for the construction of, a building to be used by the school district and provides that the title to the building shall vest in the school district at the end of the lease.
This bill would delete the language that provides that the governing board of a school district is not required to advertise for bids pursuant to this provision. The bill would require an instrument created pursuant to these provisions to be awarded based on a competitive solicitation process to the proposer providing the best value, as defined, to the school district. The bill would require the governing board of the school district to adopt and publish required procedures and guidelines for evaluating the qualifications of proposers, as provided. The bill would authorize a school district, for purposes of utilizing preconstruction services, to enter into an instrument before written approval is obtained from the Department of General Services’ Division of the State Architect (DSA) only if the instrument provides that no work for which a contractor is required to be licensed and for which DSA approval is required can be performed before receipt of the required DSA approval.
The bill would provide, for certain projects leased through an instrument before July 1, 2015, if at any time the instrument is determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because it fails to fall within the former competitive bidding exception, that the contractor who entered into the contract with the school district may be paid the reasonable cost, specifically excluding profit, of the labor, equipment, materials, and services furnished by the contractor before the date of the determination, if certain conditions, as determined by the court, are met. The bill would authorize a school district to identify specific types of subcontractors required to be included in a proposal, and would impose specified other procedural requirements on awarding construction subcontracts of a certain value. The bill would provide that the changes made by its provisions, except the deletion of the governing board of a school district’s authority to not advertise for bids, shall become inoperative on July 1, 2022.","An act to amend Sections 17400 and 17406 of the Education Code, relating to school facilities."

84222.5.
(a) A publicly funded nonprofit organization that makes contributions or expenditures, either directly or through the control of another entity, shall establish and deposit into a separate bank account all funds that will be used to make contributions and expenditures, and those contributions and expenditures shall come from that separate bank account.
(b) In addition to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 84222, a publicly funded nonprofit organization is a recipient committee within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 82013 if any of the following occur:
(1) It makes contributions or expenditures totaling fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more related to statewide candidates or ballot measures or makes contributions or expenditures totaling two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or more related to local candidates or ballot measures, either directly or through the control of another entity, during the prior quarter.
(2) By January 31 of each odd-numbered year, it makes contributions or expenditures totaling one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more related to statewide candidates or ballot measures or makes contributions or expenditures totaling ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more related to local candidates or ballot measures, either directly or through the control of another entity, during the previous two years.
(c) If a publicly funded nonprofit organization qualifies as a recipient committee pursuant to subdivision (b), it shall comply with the registration and reporting requirements of Section 84222.
(d) Each publicly funded nonprofit organization that makes contributions or expenditures, either directly or through the control of another entity, shall provide to the Commission, and display on the organization’s Internet Web site, the information it is required to disclose under this section. The information shall be clearly described and identified on a separate Internet Web page that is linked from the homepage of the organization’s Internet Web site. The link to this Internet Web page from the homepage shall be as visible as all similar links.
(e) The Commission may require an audit of a publicly funded nonprofit organization that is required to provide records to the Commission pursuant to this section. The Commission shall require an audit of any publicly funded nonprofit organization that makes contributions or expenditures in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in a calendar year. The publicly funded nonprofit organization shall provide records to the Commission to substantiate the information required to be disclosed by this section.

(g) The definitions in subdivision (b) of Section 54964.5 apply to this section.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law prohibits a nonprofit organization or an officer, employee, or agent of a nonprofit organization from using, or permitting another to use, public resources received from a local agency for any campaign activity not authorized by law. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General, any district attorney, or any city attorney of a city with a population over 750,000 to bring a civil action to recover a civil penalty against any person who intentionally or negligently violates that prohibition.
This bill would clarify that the prohibition applies to making contributions or expenditures not authorized by law, and would specify certain expenditures authorized by law that are not subject to the prohibition.
(2) Existing law requires a reporting nonprofit organization that engages in campaign activity to deposit into a separate bank account all specific sources of funds it receives and to pay for all campaign activity from that separate bank account. Existing law defines “reporting nonprofit organization” as a nonprofit organization for which public resources from one or more local agencies account for more than 20% of the nonprofit organization’s annual gross revenue, as specified.
Existing law requires a reporting nonprofit organization that engages in campaign activity of specified amounts or more to periodically disclose to the Franchise Tax Board, and post on its Internet Web site in a certain manner, the identity and amount of each specific source or sources of funds it receives for campaign activity, a description of the campaign activity, and the identity and amount of payments the organization makes from the required separate bank account. Existing law authorizes, and in some instances requires, the Franchise Tax Board to audit a reporting nonprofit organization, requires the board to issue a written audit report, and requires the board to transmit the audit report to the Attorney General and the district attorney for the county in which the reporting nonprofit organization is domiciled. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or the district attorney for the county in which the reporting nonprofit organization is domiciled to impose a monetary civil penalty of up to $10,000 against a reporting nonprofit organization for misusing public resources received from a local agency, as described in (1), for failing to maintain the separate bank account, or for not complying with the disclosure requirements described above.
This bill would recast and relocate those provisions within the Political Reform Act of 1974, thereby making the Fair Political Practices Commission responsible for their administration and enforcement, except as specified. The bill would change the term “reporting nonprofit organization” to “publicly funded nonprofit organization,” defined as a nonprofit organization for which public resources from one or more local agencies account for more than 20% of the nonprofit organization’s annual gross revenue, as specified. The bill would require certain publicly funded nonprofit organizations to register as recipient committees and file the campaign statements that those committees are required to file under the act. This bill would shift the Franchise Tax Board’s authority and duties under these provisions to the Commission and would authorize the Commission, in addition to the Attorney General or the district attorney, to impose the monetary civil penalty of up to $10,000 against a publicly funded nonprofit organization.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 makes a willful violation of its provisions a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","An act to amend Section 54964.5 of, to add Section 84222.5 to, and to repeal Section 54964.6 of, the Government Code, relating to nonprofit organizations."

As of the effective date of this section, the director shall begin phasing in the statewide cancer reporting system. By July 1, 1988, all county or regional registries shall be implemented or initiated. By July 1, 1990, the statewide cancer reporting system shall be fully operational. Within 60 days of the effective date of this section, the director shall submit an implementation and funding schedule to the Legislature.
(b) The department may designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and may establish regional cancer registries, with the responsibility and authority to carry out the intent of this section in designated areas.

The department may establish a competitive process to receive applications for, and issue, the award of a contract, grant, or allocation of funds, including, but not limited to, a cooperative agreement, subvention agreement, or any other agreement allowed by law, to an agency, including, but not limited to, a health systems agency, single county health department, multicounty health department grouping, or nonprofit professional association to operate the statewide cancer reporting system and to enter into contracts, or issue grants or funding allocations to other agencies representing a designated cancer reporting region for the purposes of collecting and collating cancer incidence data. The award of these contracts, grants, or funding allocations shall be exempt from Part 2 (commencing with Section 10100) of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. The department shall include appropriate terms and conditions in a contract, grant, or funding allocation to ensure the proper use of state funds, including provision for reimbursement of allowable costs, financial reporting, program performance reporting, monitoring of subgrants, subcontracts, or suballocations to an agency representing a designated cancer reporting region, retention and access requirements for records, data use and management, independent auditing, termination, and disposition of assets acquired under the contract, grant, or funding allocation.

In these cases, the pathologist shall reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information.
(C) A pathologist shall not be responsible for acquiring missing or inaccessible patient demographic information not provided to him or her beyond the content of the required cancer-specific data elements.
(D) For purposes of reports submitted pursuant to this paragraph, the department shall prescribe the data required to be included in the report, work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission, and designate an Internet Web portal for electronic submission.

If a pathology report is submitted by a pathologist electronically, pursuant to this paragraph, the same pathology report is not required to be submitted to the department by any other means.
(e) Any hospital or other facility that is required to reimburse the department or its authorized representative for the cost to access and report the information pursuant to subdivision (d) shall provide payment to the department or its authorized representative within 60 days of the date this payment is demanded.

1/2
percent per month of the outstanding balance. Further, in the event that the department or its authorized representative takes a legal action to recover its costs and any associated fees, and the department or its authorized representative receives a judgment in its favor, the hospital or other facility shall also reimburse the department or its authorized representative for any additional costs it incurred to pursue the legal action. Late fees and payments made to the department by hospitals or other facilities pursuant to this subdivision shall be considered as reimbursements of the additional costs incurred by the department.
(f) All physicians and surgeons, hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and all other facilities, individuals, or agencies providing diagnostic or treatment services to patients with cancer shall grant to the department or the authorized representative access to all records that would identify cases of cancer or would establish characteristics of the cancer, treatment of the cancer, or medical status of any identified cancer patient.

Existing law authorizes the department to designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and establish regional cancer registries to provide cancer incidence data. Existing law requires any hospital or other facility providing therapy to cancer patients within a cancer reporting area to report each case of cancer to the department or the authorized representative of the department in a format prescribed by the department. Existing law provides that if the hospital or other facility fails to report in a format prescribed by the department, the department’s authorized representative is authorized to access the information from the hospital or the facility and report it in the appropriate format. In these cases, existing law requires the hospital or other health facility to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. Existing law also requires any physician, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients to report each cancer case to the department or the authorized representative of the department, except for those cases directly referred to a treatment facility or those previously admitted to a treatment facility for diagnosis or treatment of that instance of cancer.
This bill, on or after January 1, 2019, would, among other things, require a pathologist diagnosing cancer to report cancer diagnoses to the department by electronic means, including, but not limited to, either directly from an electronic medical record or using a designated Internet Web portal provided by the department. If a pathologist fails to report electronically and with an approved format, the bill would authorize the department’s authorized representative to access the information from the pathologist in an appropriate alternative format. In these cases, the bill would require the pathologist to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. The bill would require the department to prescribe the data required to be included in the reports and to work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission of the reports.","An act to amend Section 103885 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to cancer."
1081,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Computer science education is not only about access to computers. It is about innovation and development of technology. Computer science education builds pupils’ computational and critical thinking skills, which enables them to create, and not simply use, the next generation of technological tools. This fundamental knowledge is needed to prepare pupils for the 21st century regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation.
(2) Computer science drives job creation and innovation throughout our state’s economy. Providing access to computer science education is a critical step for ensuring that California remains competitive in the global economy and strengthens its cybersecurity. Last year, there were over 600,000 technology jobs open across the United States, and, by 2018, 51 percent of all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs are projected to be in computer science-related fields. In California, there are currently 86,436 open computing jobs, which is four times the average demand rate in California.
(3) Computing occupations make up two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, making computer science one of the most in-demand college degrees. However, California only had 3,525 computer science graduates in 2014 with only 15 percent female graduates.
(4) There are fewer advanced placement (AP) examinations taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area. Of the high school pupils in California who took the AP computer science examination in 2015, only 26 percent were female, only 973 were Latino, and only 148 were African American. Only 242 schools in California, or 16 percent of California schools with AP programs, offered the AP computer science course in the 2013–14 school year.
(5) President Obama’s Computer Science for All initiative builds on the momentum at the state and local level. The President’s upcoming budget proposes funding for the United States Department of Education, available over three years, for states to increase access to computer science education in elementary and secondary education classrooms. Under the program, states would submit comprehensive five-year “Computer Science for All” plans in order to be eligible for federal funding, and every state with a well-designed strategy would receive funds. In addition to state-level grants, the budget will also dedicate funds for competitive grants specifically for leading districts to execute ambitious computer science education expansion efforts for all pupils, including traditionally underrepresented pupils, with those efforts to serve as models for national replication.
(6) However, access to computer science education for all pupils is still a challenge, especially for underrepresented communities. Only one out of four K–12 schools teaches any computer science, leaving 75 percent of pupils today without the opportunity to develop skills that could help them thrive in the future.
(7) Exposure to computer science at a young age has the potential to address the diversity gap in computer science fields. Girls who take AP computer science in high school are 10 times more likely to major in computer science in college. African American and Latino pupils who take this course in high school are over seven times more likely to major in this field.
(8) A Google-Gallup survey found that nine out of 10 parents say they want computer science taught in their schools, and the majority of parents and teachers believe it should be required learning for 21st century pupils.
(9) Computer science has often been confused with broader technology education in schools. California should adopt distinct standards for computer science focused on both the creation and use of software and computing technologies at all levels of K–12 education.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that all pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, have access to computer science education, with a strong focus on pupils underrepresented in computer science, including girls, low-income and underserved school districts, and rural and urban school districts.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the only predetermined outcome be to increase access to computer science in California schools and to account for disparate views as recommendations are provided.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Real Estate Law provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers and real estate salespersons by the Bureau of Real Estate headed by the Real Estate Commissioner. Existing law requires the commissioner to provide on the Internet specific information regarding the status of every license issued by the department. That law requires a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by that real estate broker. That law makes a willful or knowing violation of any if its provisions punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, require that information to include whether a licensee is an associate licensee and, if the associate licensee is a broker, to identify each responsible broker with whom the licensee is contractually associated. This bill would additionally require a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate broker acting as a salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by the responsible real estate broker and would make certain nonsubstantive changes. By placing a new requirement on a real estate broker to report to the commissioner regarding the employment or termination of a real estate broker acting as a salesperson, this bill would expand an existing crime.

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Sections 10083.2 and 10161.8 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to real estate licensees."

The act requires each applicant for a license to practice dentistry to successfully complete specified examinations, including receiving a passing score on either a portfolio examination, as specified, or a clinical and written examination administered by the Western Regional Examining Board, which determines the passing score for that examination.
This bill would additionally allow an applicant to satisfy that examination requirement by receiving a passing score on the clinical and written examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., subject to prior review and approval of the examination by the Office of Professional Examination Services, as provided, delivery of this review to the Dental Board of California, and payment of specified expenses incurred by the board.

The provisions of this subdivision are in addition to other civil remedies and do not limit merchants or other persons to elect to pursue other civil remedies.
(d) In lieu of the fines prescribed by subdivision (a), any person may be required to perform public services designated by the court, provided that in no event shall any
such
person be required to perform less than the number of hours of
such
public service necessary to satisfy the fine assessed by the court as provided by subdivision (a) at the minimum wage prevailing in the state at the time of sentencing.

The fines allocated shall be administered by the county superintendent of schools to finance public school programs, which provide counseling or other educational services designed to discourage shoplifting, theft, and burglary. Subject to rules and regulations
as may be
adopted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, each county superintendent of schools shall allocate

Should the person detained refuse to surrender the recording or item of which there is probable cause to believe has been recorded on or unlawfully taken from the premises, or attempted to be recorded or unlawfully taken from the premises, a limited and reasonable search may be conducted by those authorized to make the detention in order to recover the item. Only packages, shopping bags, handbags or other property in the immediate possession of the person detained, but not including any clothing worn by the person, may be searched pursuant to this subdivision.

Section 4030 of the
Penal Code
is amended to read:
4030.
(a)(1)The Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement policies and practices for conducting strip or body cavity searches of detained persons vary widely throughout California. Consequently, some people have been arbitrarily subjected to unnecessary strip and body cavity searches after arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction offenses. Some present search practices violate state and federal constitutional rights to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.
(2)It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.
(b)The provisions of this section shall apply only to prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses and to any minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code alleged to have committed a misdemeanor or infraction offense. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person in the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

(d)Notwithstanding any other law, including Section 40304.5 of the Vehicle Code, if a person is arrested and taken into custody, that person may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell.
(e)A person who is arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, or a minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601 or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, except for those minors alleged to have committed felonies or offenses involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail population, unless a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, to believe that person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband. A strip search or visual body cavity search, or both, shall not be conducted without the prior written authorization of the supervising officer on duty. The authorization shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.
(f)(1)Except pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2), a person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be confined in the general jail population unless all of the following are true:

(2)A person shall not be housed in the general jail population prior to release pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) unless a documented emergency exists and there is no reasonable alternative to that placement. The person shall be placed in the general population only upon prior written authorization documenting the specific facts and circumstances of the emergency. The written authorization shall be signed by the uniformed supervisor of the facility or by a uniformed watch commander. A person confined in the general jail population pursuant to paragraph (1) shall retain all rights to release on citation, his or her own recognizance, or bail that were preempted as a consequence of the emergency.
(g)A person who is arrested on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, or a minor described in subdivision (b), shall not be subjected to a physical body cavity search except under the authority of a search warrant issued by a magistrate specifically authorizing the physical body cavity search.
(h)A copy of the prior written authorization required by subdivisions (e) and (f) and the search warrant required by subdivision (g) shall be placed in the agency’s records and made available, on request, to the person searched or his or her authorized representative. With regard to a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search, the time, date, and place of the search, the name and sex of the person conducting the search, and a statement of the results of the search, including a list of items removed from the person searched, shall be recorded in the agency’s records and made available, upon request, to the person searched or his or her authorized representative.
(i)Persons conducting a strip search or a visual body cavity search shall not touch the breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of the person being searched.

(l)All strip, visual, and physical body cavity searches shall be conducted in an area of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search. Persons are considered to be participating in the search if their official duties relative to search procedure require them to be present at the time the search is conducted.
(m)A person who knowingly and willfully authorizes or conducts a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search in violation of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(n)This section does not limit the common law or statutory rights of a person regarding an action for damages or injunctive relief, or preclude the prosecution under another law of a peace officer or other person who has violated this section.
(o)Any person who suffers damage or harm as a result of a violation of this section may bring a civil action to recover actual damages, or one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is greater. In addition, the court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages, equitable relief as it deems necessary and proper, and costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees.","Existing law makes petty theft involving merchandise taken from a merchant’s premises punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not more than $1,000, and imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 6 months.
This bill would provide that nothing in that section or any other law precludes a merchant from offering a person suspected of theft an opportunity to complete a precomplaint diversion program in lieu of arrest and criminal prosecution, or informing a person suspected of theft of the criminal civil remedies available to the merchant.
Existing law generally prohibits strip searches and body cavity searches of prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses. Existing law allows a person who has been arrested and taken into custody to be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","An act to amend Section

(iii)Each regional board that receives money pursuant to clause (ii) shall spend not less than 50 percent of that money solely on stormwater inspection and regulatory compliance issues associated with industrial and construction stormwater programs.
(3)A person who would be required to pay the annual fee prescribed by paragraph (1) for waste discharge requirements applicable to discharges of solid waste, as defined in Section 40191 of the Public Resources Code, at a waste management unit that is also regulated under Division 30 (commencing with Section 40000) of the Public Resources Code, shall be entitled to a waiver of the annual fee for the discharge of solid waste at the waste management unit imposed by paragraph (1) upon verification by the state board of payment of the fee imposed by Section 48000 of the Public Resources Code, and provided that the fee established pursuant to Section 48000 of the Public Resources Code generates revenues sufficient to fund the programs specified in Section 48004 of the Public Resources Code and the amount appropriated by the Legislature for those purposes is not reduced.
(e)Each person that discharges waste in a manner regulated by this section shall pay an annual fee to the state board. The state board shall establish, by regulation, a timetable for the payment of the annual fee. If the state board or a regional board determines that the discharge will not affect, or have the potential to affect, the quality of the waters of the state, all or part of the annual fee shall be refunded.

The total revenue collected each year through annual fees shall be set at an amount equal to the revenue levels set forth in the Budget Act for this activity.

(2)The emergency regulations adopted pursuant to this subdivision, any amendment thereto, or subsequent adjustments to the annual fees, shall be adopted by the state board in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The adoption of these regulations is an emergency and shall be considered by the Office of Administrative Law as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare. Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, any emergency regulations adopted by the state board, or adjustments to the annual fees made by the state board pursuant to this section, shall not be subject to review by the Office of Administrative Law and shall remain in effect until revised by the state board.

(k)In addition to the report required by subdivision (a), before a person discharges mining waste, the person shall first submit both of the following to the regional board:
(1)A report on the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste that could affect its potential to cause pollution or contamination. The report shall include the results of all tests required by regulations adopted by the board, any test adopted by the Department of Toxic Substances Control pursuant to Section 25141 of the Health and Safety Code for extractable, persistent, and bioaccumulative toxic substances in a waste or other material, and any other tests that the state board or regional board may require, including, but not limited to, tests needed to determine the acid-generating potential of the mining waste or the extent to which hazardous substances may persist in the waste after disposal.
(2)A report that evaluates the potential of the discharge of the mining waste to produce, over the long term, acid mine drainage, the discharge or leaching of heavy metals, or the release of other hazardous substances.
(l)Except upon a written request of the regional board, a report of waste discharge need not be filed pursuant to subdivision (a) or (c) by a user of recycled water that is being supplied by a supplier or distributor of recycled water for whom a master recycling permit has been issued pursuant to Section 13523.1.","Existing law prohibits the use of any vacuum or suction dredge equipment by any person in any river, stream, or lake of this state without a permit issued by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law requires the department to issue a permit if the department determines that the use does not cause any significant effects to fish and wildlife and would authorize the department to adjust the specified fee to an amount sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of the department in regulating suction dredging activities. Existing law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board or a California regional water quality control board to adopt waste discharge requirements or a waiver of waste discharge requirements that address certain water quality impacts, specify conditions or areas where the discharge of waste or other adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the waters of the state from the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is prohibited, or prohibit particular use of, or methods of using, vacuum or suction dredge equipment, or any portion thereof, for the extraction of minerals, that the state board or a regional board determines generally cause or contribute to an exceedance of applicable water quality objectives or unreasonably impact beneficial uses.
This bill would require the state board and the department to report to the Legislature, on or before June 1, 2017, on the status of the suction dredge permitting program.
Under existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal state agencies with responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality in the state. The act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","An act to

An employer who willfully refuses to rehire, promote, or otherwise restore an employee or former employee who has been determined to be eligible for rehiring or promotion by a grievance procedure or hearing authorized by law is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(d) (1) An employee who is discharged, threatened with discharge, demoted, suspended, or in any other manner discriminated or retaliated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because the employee has exercised his or her rights as set forth in subdivision (a) may file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to Section 98.7.
(2) Notwithstanding any time limitation in Section 98.7, an employee may file a complaint with the division based upon a violation of subdivision (a) within one year from the date of occurrence of the violation.

(2) “Sexual assault” means any of the crimes set forth in Section 261, 261.5, 262, 265, 266, 266a, 266b, 266c, 266g, 266j, 267, 269, 273.4, 285, 286, 288, 288a, 288.5, 289, or 311.4 of the Penal Code, as amended.
(3) “Stalking” means a crime set forth in Section 646.9 of the Penal Code or Section 1708.7 of the Civil Code.

The Labor Commissioner shall develop the form and post it in accordance with this paragraph on or before July 1, 2017.
(3) Employers shall not be required to comply with paragraph (1) until the Labor Commissioner posts the form on the commissioner’s Internet Web site in accordance with paragraph (2).","Existing law prohibits an employer from discharging or in any manner discriminating or retaliating against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for taking time off from work for specified purposes related to addressing the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Existing law provides that any employee who is discharged, threatened with discharge, demoted, suspended, or in any manner discriminated or retaliated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because the employee has taken time off for those purposes is entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer, as well as appropriate equitable relief, and is allowed to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement within the Department of Industrial Relations. Existing law establishes the Labor Commissioner as the head of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.
This bill would require employers to inform each employee of his or her rights established under those laws by providing specific information in writing to new employees upon hire and to other employees upon request. The bill would also require the Labor Commissioner, on or before July 1, 2017, to develop a form an employer may elect to use to comply with these provisions and to post it on the commissioner’s Internet Web site.

This bill would require the allocation of up to 5 vacant judgeships, as defined, from superior courts with more authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need to superior courts with fewer authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need. The bill would require the allocation to be in accordance with a methodology approved by the Judicial Council, as specified, and would require the determination of a superior court’s assessed judicial need to be in accordance with the above uniform standards and be based on the criteria described above.

In the event the homeowner elects to have a rental agreement for a term of 12 months or less, including a month-to-month rental agreement, the rental agreement shall contain the same rental charges, terms, and conditions as the rental agreement offered pursuant to subdivision (b), during the first 12 months, except for options, if any, contained in the offered rental agreement to extend or renew the rental agreement.
(d)Nothing in subdivision (c) shall be construed to prohibit the management from offering gifts of value, other than rental rate reductions, to homeowners who execute a rental agreement pursuant to this section.

The failure of the management to provide the written notice shall make the rental agreement voidable at the homeowner’s option upon the homeowner’s discovery of the failure. The receipt of any written notice provided pursuant to this subdivision shall be acknowledged in writing by the homeowner.
(g)No rental agreement subject to subdivision (a) that is first entered into on or after January 1, 1993, shall have a provision which authorizes automatic extension or renewal of, or automatically extends or renews, the rental agreement for a period beyond the initial stated term at the sole option of either the management or the homeowner.

The measurements shall be made using the best available technologies and best professional practices, as defined in Section 5100, using a device or methods satisfactory to the board, as follows:
(A)A device shall be capable of continuous monitoring of the rate and quantity of water diverted and shall be properly maintained. The permittee or licensee shall provide the board with evidence that the device has been installed with the first report submitted after installation of the device. The permittee or licensee shall provide the board with evidence demonstrating that the device is functioning properly as part of the reports submitted at five-year intervals after the report documenting installation of the device, or upon request of the board.
(B)In developing regulations pursuant to Section 1841, the board shall consider devices and methods that provide accurate measurement of the total amount diverted and the rate of diversion.

Under the local policy, a family that qualifies for child care pursuant to Section 8354 shall be treated for purposes of eligibility and fees in the same manner as a family that qualifies for subsidized child care on another basis pursuant to the local policy.
(ii) Fees, including, but not limited to, family fees, sliding scale fees, and copayments for those families that are not income eligible, as defined by Section 8263.1.
(iii) Reimbursement rates.
(iv) Methods of maximizing the efficient use of subsidy funds, including, but not limited to, multiyear contracting with the department for center-based child care, and interagency agreements that allow for flexible and temporary transfer of funds among agencies.

(4) Establishment of measurable outcomes to evaluate the success of the plan to achieve the county’s child care goals, and to overcome any barriers identified in the state’s child care subsidy system.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the county to change the regional market rate survey results for the county.
8332.3.
(a) The plan shall be submitted to the local planning council, as defined in subdivision (g) of Section 8499, for approval. Upon approval of the plan by the local planning council, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan. Following the hearing, if the board votes in favor of the plan, the plan shall be submitted to the Early Education and Support Division of the department for review.

8332.6.
A participating contractor shall receive an increase or decrease in funding that the contractor would have received if the contractor had not participated in the plan.
8332.7.
This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2022, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2022, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the County of Santa Clara. Existing law does not reflect the fiscal reality of living in the County of Santa Clara, a high-cost county where the cost of living is well beyond the state median level, resulting in reduced access to quality child care. In recognition of the unintended consequences of living in a high-cost county, this act is necessary to provide children and families in the County of Santa Clara proper access to child care through an individualized county child care subsidy plan.","The Child Care and Development Services Act has a purpose of providing a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective system of child care and development services for children from infancy to 13 years of age and their parents, including a full range of supervision, health, and support services through full- and part-time programs. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop standards for the implementation of quality child care programs. Existing law authorizes the County of Alameda, as a pilot project, to develop an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as provided.
This bill would authorize, until January 1, 2022, the County of Santa Clara to develop and implement an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as specified. The bill would require the plan to be submitted to the local planning council and the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors for approval, as specified. The bill would require the Early Education and Support Division of the State Department of Education to review and approve or disapprove the plan and any subsequent modifications to the plan. The bill would require the County of Santa Clara to annually prepare and submit to the Legislature, the State Department of Social Services, and the State Department of Education a report that contains specified information relating to the success of the county’s plan.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Santa Clara.","An act to add and repeal Article 15.1 (commencing with Section 8332) of Chapter 2 of Part 6 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, relating to child care and development services."

SECTION 1.
Article 2 (commencing with Section 18706) is added to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read:
Article  2. Special Olympics Fund
18706.
(a) Any individual may designate on the tax return that a contribution in excess of the tax liability, if any, be made to the Special Olympics Fund established by Section 18707 to be used by the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California.
(b) The contribution shall be in full dollar amounts and may be made individually by each signatory on the joint return.
(c) A designation under subdivision (a) shall be made for any taxable year on the original return for that taxable year, and once made shall be irrevocable. If payments and credits reported on the return, together with any other credits associated with the individual’s account, do not exceed the individual’s tax liability, the return shall be treated as though no designation has been made.
(d) (1) The Franchise Tax Board shall revise the form of the return to include a space labeled “Special Olympics Fund” to allow for the designation permitted under subdivision (a). The form shall also include in the instructions information that the contribution may be in the amount of one dollar ($1) or more and that the contribution shall be used to conduct the activities of the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California in support of children and adults with intellectual disabilities.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a voluntary contribution designation for the Special Olympics Fund shall not be added on the tax return until another voluntary contribution designation is removed or space is available, whichever occurs first.
(e) A deduction shall be allowed under Article 6 (commencing with Section 17201) of Chapter 3 of Part 10 for any contribution made pursuant to subdivision (a).
18707.
There is hereby established in the State Treasury the Special Olympics Fund to receive contributions made pursuant to Section 18706. The Franchise Tax Board shall notify the Controller of both the amount of money paid by taxpayers in excess of their tax liability and the amount of refund money that taxpayers have designated pursuant to Section 18706 to be transferred to the Special Olympics Fund. The Controller shall transfer from the Personal Income Tax Fund to the Special Olympics Fund an amount not in excess of the sum of the amounts designated by individuals pursuant to Section 18706 for payment into that fund.
18708.
All moneys transferred to the Special Olympics Fund pursuant to Section 18707, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be allocated as follows:
(a) To the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of all costs incurred by the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller in connection with their duties under this article.
(b) To the State Department of Social Services where the balance shall be disbursed between the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California based on the amount of donations provided by taxpayers in each organization’s jurisdiction based on the county of the taxpayer contributing, for the purpose of supporting children and adults with intellectual disabilities. The State Department of Social Services shall be responsible for overseeing that disbursement and may use up to 3 percent of the moneys allocated to it for administrative costs. The Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California shall not use the moneys received pursuant to this article for administrative costs.
(c) The Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California shall annually provide a report to the State Department of Social Services that includes documentation that the moneys disbursed to each organization pursuant to this section were not used for administrative costs nor for any purposes outside of California and that describes in narrative form the amount of moneys received pursuant to this section and the purposes for which the moneys were expended.
18709.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), this article shall remain in effect only until January 1 of the fifth taxable year following the first appearance of the Special Olympics Fund on the personal income tax return, and is repealed as of December 1 of that year.
(b) (1) By September 1 of the second calendar year and each subsequent calendar year that the Special Olympics Fund appears on the tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall do both of the following:
(A) Determine the minimum contribution amount required to be received during the next calendar year for the fund to appear on the tax return for the taxable year that includes that next calendar year.
(B) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Franchise Tax Board shall estimate the amount of contributions to be received by using the actual amounts received and an estimate of the contributions that will be received by the end of that calendar year.
(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article shall be inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year and shall be repealed on December 1 of that year.
(3) For purposes of this section, the minimum contribution amount for a calendar year means two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the second calendar year after the first appearance of the Special Olympics Fund on the personal income tax return or the minimum contribution amount as adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c).
(c) For each calendar year, beginning with the third calendar year after the first appearance of the Special Olympics Fund on the personal income tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall adjust, on or before September 1 of that calendar year, the minimum contribution amount specified in subdivision (b) as follows:
(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.","Under existing law, taxpayers are allowed to contribute amounts in excess of their personal income tax liability for the support of various funds. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would allow a taxpayer to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the Special Olympics Fund, which the bill would create. The bill would require moneys transferred to the Special Olympics Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the State Department of Social Services for disbursement to the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California for the purpose of funding activities of the Special Olympics in support of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, as provided. The bill would authorize the State Department of Social Services to use up to 3% of the moneys allocated to it for administrative costs. The bill would require the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California to annually provide a report to the State Department of Social Services regarding the expenditure of the moneys disbursed to each organization, as specified.","An act to add and repeal Article 2 (commencing with Section 18706) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

The election shall be made upon written application signed by the member and filed with the board, pursuant to enrollment procedures and during an enrollment period established by the board, which enrollment period shall not occur more frequently than once every three years for that member. The change in plan membership shall be effective as of the transfer date, as defined in subdivision (d). Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rights and obligations of a member who elects to change membership under this section shall be governed by the terms of this article on and after the transfer date. Prior to the transfer date, the rights to retirement, survivors’, or other benefits payable to a member and his or her survivors or beneficiaries shall continue to be governed by Retirement Plan D.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, effective as of the transfer date, a member who has transferred to Retirement Plan E pursuant to this section and his or her survivors or beneficiaries shall receive retirement, survivors’, and other benefits that shall consist of: (1) the benefits to which they are entitled under the terms of Retirement Plan E, but based on the member’s service credited only under that plan, and payable at the time and in the manner provided under Retirement Plan E, and (2) the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the terms of Retirement Plan D had the member remained a member of Retirement Plan D, but based on the member’s service credited only under that plan, and payable at the time and in the manner provided under Retirement Plan D. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the calculation of the member’s, survivors’, or beneficiaries’ benefits under each plan shall be subject to that plan’s respective, separate terms, including, but not limited to, the definitions of “final compensation” and provisions establishing cost-of-living adjustments, establishing minimum retirement age and service requirements, and governing integration with federal social security payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate service credited under both retirement plans shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining eligibility for and vesting of benefits under each plan.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of Retirement Plan D or Retirement Plan E:
(1) A member who has transferred to Retirement Plan E pursuant to this section may not retire for disability and receive disability retirement benefits under Retirement Plan D.
(2) If a member who has transferred to Retirement Plan E pursuant to this section dies prior to retirement, that member’s survivor or beneficiary may not receive survivor or death benefits under Retirement Plan D but shall receive a refund of the member’s contributions to Retirement Plan D together with all interest credited thereto.
(d) As used in this section:
(1) “Period of active employment” means a period during which the member is actively performing the duties of a full-time or part-time employee position or is on any authorized paid leave of absence, except a leave of absence during which the member is totally disabled and is receiving, or is eligible to receive, disability benefits, either during or after any elimination or qualifying period, under a disability plan provided by the employer.
(2) “Retirement Plan D” means the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to members of the system between June 1, 1979, and December 31, 2012, inclusive.
(3) “Retirement Plan E” means the noncontributory retirement plan established under this article.
(4) “Transfer date” means the first day of the first month that is at least 30 days after the date that the application is filed with the board to change plan membership under subdivision (a).
(e) This section shall only be applicable to Los Angeles County and shall not become operative until the board of supervisors of that county elects, by resolution adopted by a majority vote, to make this section operative in the county.
SEC. 2.
Section 31494.5 of the Government Code is amended to read:
31494.5.
(a) A general member whose benefits are governed by Retirement Plan E may, during a period of active employment, elect to change plan membership and become a member, prospectively, in Retirement Plan D. The election shall be made upon written application signed by the member and filed with the board, pursuant to enrollment procedures and during an enrollment period established by the board, which enrollment period shall not occur more frequently than once every three years for that member. The change in plan membership shall be effective as of the transfer date, as defined in subdivision (g). Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rights and obligations of a member who elects to change membership under this section shall be governed by the terms of Retirement Plan D on and after the transfer date. Prior to the transfer date, the rights to retirement, survivors’, or other benefits payable to a member and his or her survivors or beneficiaries shall continue to be governed by Retirement Plan E.
(b) If a member has made the election to change plans under subdivision (a), monthly contributions by the member and the employer under the terms of Retirement Plan D shall commence as of the transfer date. For the purposes of calculating the member’s contribution rate under Retirement Plan D, his or her entry age shall be deemed to be his or her age at his or her birthday nearest the transfer date; however, if the member exchanges service credit in accordance with subdivision (c), with regard to contributions made for periods after that exchange, his or her entry age shall be adjusted and deemed to be the member’s age at his or her birthday nearest the date on which begins the most recent period of unbroken service credited under Retirement Plan D, taking into account service purchased under subdivision (c). In no event shall the exchange of service under subdivision (c) affect the entry age with respect to, or the cost of, employee contributions made, or service purchased, prior to the exchange.
(c) (1) A general member who has elected to change plans under subdivision (a) also may elect to exchange, at that time or any time thereafter, but prior to the earlier of his or her application for retirement, termination from employment, or death, some portion designated in whole-month increments, or all of the service credited under Retirement Plan E for an equivalent amount of service credited under Retirement Plan D, provided, however, that the member may not exchange less than 12 months’ service or, if less, the total service credited under Retirement Plan E. The exchange shall be effective on the date when the member completes the purchase of that service by depositing in the retirement fund, by lump sum or regular monthly installments, over the period of time determined by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the board of retirement, or both, but in any event prior to the earlier of his or her death or the date that is 120 days after the effective date of his or her retirement, the sum of: (1) the contributions the member would have made to the retirement fund under Retirement Plan D for that length of time for which the member shall receive credit as service under Retirement Plan D, computed in accordance with the rate of contribution applicable to the member under Retirement Plan D, based upon his or her entry age, and in the same manner prescribed under Retirement Plan D as if that plan had been in effect during the period for which the member shall receive service credit, and (2) the regular interest thereon.
(2) For the purposes of this subdivision, a member’s entry age shall be deemed to be the member’s age at his or her birthday nearest the date on which begins the most recent period of unbroken service credited under Retirement Plan D following completion of the service exchange under this subdivision. A member may receive credit for a period of service under only one plan and in no event shall a member receive credit for the same period of service under both Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E.
(3) A member who fails to complete the purchase of service as required under this subdivision shall be treated as completing an exchange of service under Retirement Plan E for an equivalent amount of service under Retirement Plan D only with regard to the service that actually has been purchased through completed deposit with the retirement fund of the requisite purchase amount, calculated in accordance with this subdivision.
(d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, effective as of the transfer date, a member who has transferred to Retirement Plan D pursuant to this section and his or her survivors or beneficiaries shall receive retirement, disability, survivors’, death, or other benefits that shall consist of: (1) the benefits to which they are entitled under the terms of Retirement Plan D, but based on the member’s service credited only under that plan, and payable at the time and in the manner provided under Retirement Plan D, and (2) the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the terms of Retirement Plan E had the member remained a member of Retirement Plan E, but based on the member’s service credited only under that plan, and payable at the time and in the manner provided under Retirement Plan E. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the calculation of the portion of a member’s or beneficiary’s benefit that is attributable to each plan is subject to that plan’s respective, separate terms, including, but not limited to, the definitions of “final compensation” and provisions establishing cost-of-living adjustments, establishing minimum age and service requirements, and governing integration with federal social security payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate service credited under both Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining eligibility for, and vesting of, benefits under each plan.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of Retirement Plan D or Retirement Plan E, a member who transfers into Retirement Plan D under this section may retire for service-connected or nonservice-connected disability and receive disability benefits under Retirement Plan D only if he or she has either (1) completed two continuous years of active service after his or her most recent transfer date, or (2) earned five years of retirement service credit under Retirement Plan D after his or her most recent transfer date. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, a member who becomes disabled and does not meet either of these conditions (1) may apply for and receive only a deferred or service retirement allowance, or (2) may elect to transfer prospectively back to Retirement Plan E, and for the purposes of calculating his or her retirement benefits under this section, shall in lieu of credit under Retirement Plan D be credited with service under Retirement Plan E as provided under subdivision (g) of Section 31488 during any period he or she is totally disabled and is receiving, or eligible to receive, disability benefits, either during or after any elimination or qualifying period, under a disability plan provided by the employer up to the earlier of the date he or she retires or no longer qualifies for disability benefits. If a member dies before he or she is eligible to retire and before completing either two continuous years of active service after the transfer date into Retirement Plan D or after earning five years of retirement service credit under Retirement Plan D after that transfer date, that member’s beneficiary shall not be entitled to the survivor allowance under Section 31781.1 or 31781.12, if operative.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Retirement Plan D or Retirement Plan E, a member who has transferred to Retirement Plan D pursuant to this section and who retires for disability when eligible under this section and Retirement Plan D, may not also retire for service and receive service retirement benefits under Retirement Plan E. However, for the purpose of calculating disability benefits under Retirement Plan D, the “sum to which he or she would be entitled as service retirement” or his or her “service retirement allowance,” as those terms are used in Sections 31726, 31726.5, and 31727.4, shall consist of the blended benefit to which the member would be entitled under subdivision (d) if he or she retired for service, not just the service retirement benefit to which he or she would be entitled under Retirement Plan D.
(g) As used in this section:
(1) “Active service” means time spent on active, on-the-job performance of the duties of a full-time or part-time position and on any authorized paid leaves of absence; provided, however, that any authorized paid leave of absence or part-time service shall not constitute active service if the leave of absence or part-time service is necessitated by a preexisting disability, injury, or disease. The board of retirement shall determine whether or not a leave of absence or part-time service is necessitated by a preexisting disability, injury, or disease, and thus excluded from the member’s active service, based upon evidence presented by the employer and the member upon request by the board.
(2) “Entry age” means the age used for calculating the normal rate of contribution to Retirement Plan D with respect to a member who has transferred membership to Retirement Plan D under this section.
(3) “Period of active employment” means a period during which the member is actively performing the duties of a full-time or part-time employee position or is on any authorized paid leave of absence, except a leave of absence during which the member is totally disabled and is receiving, or is eligible to receive, disability benefits, either during or after any elimination or qualifying period, under a disability plan provided by the employer.
(4) “Retirement Plan D” means the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to members of the system between June 1, 1979, and December 31, 2012, inclusive.
(5) “Retirement Plan E” means the noncontributory retirement plan established under this article.
(6) “Transfer date” means the first day of the first month that is at least 30 days after the date that the application is filed with the board to change plan membership under subdivision (a).
(h) This section shall only be applicable to Los Angeles County and shall not become operative until the board of supervisors of that county elects, by resolution adopted by a majority vote, to make this section operative in the county.

Section 31495.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:
31495.7.
Section 31835.1 applies to a member eligible to retire at 55 years of age pursuant to Section 31491. This section is declaratory of existing law.
SEC. 4.
Section 31520.6 is added to the Government Code, to read:
31520.6.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 31520.3 or 31520.5, in any county in which there is an alternate retired member, if the eighth member is present, the alternate retired member may also vote as a member of the board in the event both the second and third, or both the second and seventh, or both the third and seventh members are absent for any cause.
SEC. 5.
Section 31526 of the Government Code is amended to read:
31526.
The regulations shall include provisions:
(a) For the election of officers, their terms, meetings, and all other matters relating to the administrative procedure of the board.
(b) For one of the following:
(1) The filing of a sworn statement by every person who is or becomes a member, showing date of birth, nature and duration of employment with the county, compensation received, and other information as is required by the board.
(2) In lieu of a sworn statement, the submission by the member’s employer to the retirement association of the information otherwise required in paragraph (1), in a form determined by the retirement association.
(c) For forms of annuity certificates and other forms as required.","The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL) establishes retirement plans, known as Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E, that are applicable in the retirement system in Los Angeles County and prescribes procedures for members to transfer between those plans. CERL defines “Retirement Plan E” to mean the noncontributory retirement plan established by specific provisions, and defines “Retirement Plan D” to mean the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to new members of the retirement system on the transfer date.
This bill would revise the definition of Retirement Plan D to, instead, refer to the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to members of the system between June 1, 1979, and December 31, 2012, inclusive.
CERL provides for the retirement system in Los Angeles County specific ages and pension allowances for normal and early retirement. Under CERL, a member of a CERL retirement system who is eligible to retire at 50 years of age pursuant to specified statute, or who is required to retire because of age while a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), a CERL retirement system in another county, the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS), or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, but who cannot retire concurrently from PERS, a CERL retirement system in another county, STRS, or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, is entitled to have final compensation and service determined under specific statutes as if the member had retired concurrently under that other system (concurrent retirement exception). Provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County, among other things, apply reciprocal benefits, including the concurrent retirement exception, to the retirement system in Los Angeles County.
This bill would amend provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County to provide that the concurrent retirement exception applies to a member of the retirement system in Los Angeles County eligible to retire at 55 years of age and would state that the amendment is declaratory of existing law.
CERL sets forth the membership composition for boards of retirement, as specified. Under that law, the retirement board in specified counties is comprised of 9 members and an alternate member, as specified. That law also authorizes specified counties to appoint an alternate retired member to the office of the 8th member of the board and authorizes the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board only in the event the 8th member is absent from a board meeting for any cause.
This bill would additionally authorize the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board if the 8th member is present and both the 2nd and 3rd, both the 2nd and 7th, or both the 3rd and 7th members are absent for any cause.
Under CERL, except as specified, the management of a retirement system is vested in the board of retirement. CERL authorizes such a board to make regulations not inconsistent with that law, and requires that the regulations include specific provisions, including provisions for the filing of a sworn statement by every person who is or becomes a member, showing date of birth, nature and duration of employment with the county, compensation received, and other information as is required by the board.
This bill would authorize those regulations, in lieu of a sworn statement, to provide for the submission by a member’s employer to the retirement association of the information otherwise required in a sworn statement, in a form determined by the retirement association.","An act to amend Sections 31494.2, 31494.5, and 31526 of, and to add Sections 31495.7 and 31520.6 to, the Government Code, relating to county employees’ retirement."
1095,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Chapter 15.8 (commencing with Section 67395) is added to Part 40 of Division 5 of Title 3 of the Education Code, to read:
CHAPTER  15.8. Autism Employment and Education Act
67395.
(a) This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Autism Employment and Education Act.
(b) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurological condition estimated to affect as many as one in 88 children. It is now the most common neurological disorder affecting children and one of the most common developmental disabilities.
(2) Many individuals living with ASD will need some level of support over the course of their lives. In cases where adolescents and adults with severe autism are placed into long-term care or other supported housing arrangements, the annual cost of housing, which includes caregiver time, can be four hundred dollars ($400) per day, or approximately one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) a year.
(3) It is estimated that the lifetime per capita incremental societal cost of ASD is three million two hundred thousand dollars ($3,200,000) per individual or approximately fifty thousand seven hundred ninety-three dollars ($50,793) per year on average.
(4) As of February 2016, Taft Community College is the only occupational and living skills residential program of its kind offered in California, and the program is currently unable to meet the needs of students who apply. The program has been in existence for nearly 20 years and receives the majority of its funding from regional centers in California. More than 80 percent of its graduates are employed by the end of the second year of post graduation services.
(5) According to Disability Planning Data for Riverside County, 10.5 percent of people (about 120,000 people) 21 to 64 years of age have some type of a disability. Of this number, 37 percent are employed, but this data does not indicate whether they are employed full time or part time.
(6) According to a report published in April 2012 by the Autism Society of California, “The majority of transition aged families (98 percent) believed that current adult programs are not going to meet their loved-one’s needs.” Additional findings from this report indicated that only 5 percent of people with ASD graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree and only 3 percent graduated with a master’s or an associate degree. About 12 percent of students with ASD go to college and do not succeed; this is lower than the national average of 14 percent. The number of people with ASD in California remaining at home and not participating in any type of postsecondary educational program is on the rise, going from 13 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2012.
(7) According to the Department of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities is 78.5 percent.
(8) Mandated services provided through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) end upon completion of high school, yet 60 percent of lifetime costs occur in adulthood. According to the Autism Society, there is a significant disparity in the need for, and the availability of, publicly funded long-term services and supports for people with disabilities. This disparity results in waiting lists estimated to range from 80,000 to 200,000 people nationwide.
(9) It is the intent of the Legislature that implementing a residential, occupational, and living skills program for students with mental disabilities, including autism, will accomplish all of the following objectives:
(A) The program will increase the rate of employment of students with mental disabilities from its current level of around 25 percent to 85 percent.
(B) The program will be a more affordable alternative for families than adult day treatment programs, which may cost nearly twice as much.
(C) The program will enable participating students to live independently, to learn the life skills necessary to become lifelong productive members of their local communities in California, and to not need to relocate out of state in order to receive affordable services.
(D) The program will provide students with mental disabilities a more coordinated continuity of care by incorporating all of their living skills, occupational, social, and recreational development needs into one program.
67395.5.
(a) The Autism Employment and Education Program is hereby established to develop and implement a residential, occupational, and living skills program at each participating community college and California State University campus to help students with mental disabilities, including autism, live independently, obtain employment, and become otherwise self-sufficient after they graduate or withdraw from the campus.
(b) The Autism Employment and Education Fund is hereby established in the State Treasury for purposes of this chapter. The moneys in the fund shall be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University for the implementation and administration of this chapter.
(c) The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University shall develop and implement both of the following:
(1) A residential, occupational, and living skills program at each participating college or university, as applicable, to help students with mental disabilities, including autism, live independently, obtain employment, and become otherwise self-sufficient after they graduate or withdraw from the college or university.
(2) Administrative guidelines and other requirements for purposes of developing, implementing, and administering the program described in paragraph (1).
67395.7.

19320.
(a) All commercial cannabis activity shall be conducted between licensees, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(b)  Licensing authorities administering this chapter may issue state licenses only to qualified applicants engaging in commercial cannabis activity pursuant to this chapter. One year after the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation posts a notice on its Internet Web site that the licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses, no person shall engage in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization. An entity seeking licensure pursuant to this chapter shall obtain a local license, permit, or other authorization prior to applying for state licensure. State licensing entities shall not issue a license to any applicant that is unable to provide documentation confirming authorization to operate from the local government in which the applicant proposes to operate. A licensee shall not commence activity under the authority of a state license until the applicant has obtained, in addition to the state license, a local license, permit, or other authorization from the local jurisdiction in which he or she proposes to operate, following the requirements of the applicable local ordinance.
(c) Each licensee shall obtain a separate license for each location where it engages in commercial medical cannabis activity. However, transporters only need to obtain licenses for each physical location where the licensee conducts business while not in transport or where any equipment that is not currently transporting medical cannabis or medical cannabis products permanently resides.
(d) Revocation of a local license, permit, or other required authorization shall terminate the ability of a medical cannabis business to operate within that local jurisdiction until the local jurisdiction reinstates or reissues the local license, permit, or other authorization. Local authorities shall notify the bureau upon revocation of a local license, permit, or other authorization. The bureau shall inform relevant licensing authorities.
(e) Revocation of a state license shall terminate the ability of a medical cannabis licensee to operate within California until the licensing authority reinstates or reissues the state license.
(f) In addition to the provisions of this chapter, local jurisdictions retain the power to assess fees and taxes, as applicable, on facilities that are licensed pursuant to this chapter and the business activities of those licensees.
(g) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or limit state agencies, including the Department of Food and Agriculture, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, from establishing fees to support their medical cannabis regulatory programs.
(h) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter:
(A) With regard to commercial cannabis activity in the City of Los Angeles, the licensing authorities shall not require a local license, permit, or other authorization and shall issue a state license to engage in commercial cannabis activity only if the licensing authorities determine the applicant satisfies all of the requirements of this act and demonstrates that it meets all of the following criteria established by Measure D, approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles at the May 21, 2013, general election:
(i) The applicant was operating in the City of Los Angeles as a medical marijuana business by September 14, 2007, as evidenced by a business tax registration certificate issued by the City of Los Angeles on or before November 13, 2007.
(ii) The applicant registered with the City of Los Angeles city clerk by November 13, 2007, in accordance with all of the requirements of the City of Los Angeles’ Interim Control Ordinance.
(iii) The applicant obtained a City of Los Angeles business tax registration for taxation as a medical marijuana collective (class L050).
(B) A state license issued pursuant to this paragraph for commercial cannabis activity shall have the same force and effect and shall confer the same benefits and responsibilities as licenses issued to licensees outside the City of Los Angeles that obtain a license, permit, or other authorization from the local jurisdiction.
(C) The determination of the licensing authority that an applicant for a state license meets the criteria listed in subparagraph (A) shall be based on a written or electronic notification provided to the licensing authority by the City of Los Angeles that the applicant has met the criteria. If the City of Los Angeles does not provide written or electronic notification to the licensing authority confirming an applicant has met the criteria, the licensing authority shall not issue a state license.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the voters of Los Angeles approve an initiative, after January 1, 2016, but prior to the time that the State of California begins issuing state licenses, that authorizes the City of Los Angeles to issue local licenses to medical marijuana businesses in Los Angeles, the exemption for local licensing in Los Angeles as set forth in paragraph (1) shall be superseded by the local licensing requirements as enacted by that initiative.","Existing law, the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA), provides for the licensure and regulation of medical cannabis and requires all commercial cannabis activity to be conducted between licensees. Existing law establishes the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes licensing authorities to only issue state licenses to qualified applicants. Existing law, upon the date of implementation of regulations by the licensing authority, prohibits a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization.
This bill would instead prohibit a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization one year after the bureau posts a notice on its Internet Web site that the licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses. The bill would also, with regard to commercial cannabis activity in the City of Los Angeles, prohibit licensing authorities from requiring a local license, permit, or other authorization, and would require the issuance of a state license, if the authorities determine, as specified, that the applicant meets all of the requirements of MCRSA and specified criteria relating to Measure D, which was approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles at the May 21, 2013, general election. The bill would further provide that a license issued pursuant to the above provision has the same force and effect, and confers the same benefits and responsibilities, as licenses issued to licensees not subject to the above-described exception. The bill would require the exemption to the local licensing requirement provided by these provisions to be superseded by a subsequent initiative authorizing the City of Los Angeles to issue local licenses to medical marijuana businesses in the city if the voters of Los Angeles approve the initiative prior to the time the State of California begins issuing state licenses.","An act to amend Section 19320 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to marijuana."

The bill would require each local government agency to adopt regulations for the administration of the program that include, among other things, eligibility requirements that limit the program to use by persons with extremely low income households, very low income households, lower income households, or persons and families of low or moderate income. By imposing new duties on local government agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides for the licensure, certification, and regulation of alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities, as defined, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services. Existing law authorizes the department, if certain criteria are met, to issue a single license to a residential facility or a facility wherein separate buildings or portions of a residential facility are integral components of a single alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility and all of the components of the facility are managed by the same licensee.
This bill would instead require the department, if certain criteria are met, to issue a single license to a residential facility or integral facilities and would define “integral facilities” to mean any combination of 2 or more facilities located on the same or different parcels that collectively serve 7 or more persons, as specified, and that are under the control or management of the same entity, as specified, or which together comprise one operation or enterprise.
This bill would
require
authorize
the department to deny an application for a new facility license if the proposed location is in proximity to an existing facility that would result in overconcentration. The bill would define “overconcentration” as 2 or more alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities being separated by a distance of 300 feet or less, as specified, with the exception of facilities that combine to form integral facilities. The bill would
further
authorize the
department, notwithstanding this provision,

to approve a separation distance of less than 300 feet if the proximity of facilities to one another would not conflict with regulations of the city or county in which the proposed facility will be located.
The bill would authorize a city or county to request denial of the license applied for on the basis of an overconcentration of facilities. The bill would require the department or county licensing agency, at least 45 days prior to approving an application for a new facility, to notify the appropriate city or county planning agency, as specified, of the proposed location of the facility. By imposing new duties on local officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires an alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility that serves 6 or fewer persons to be considered a residential use of property, as specified, and requires the residents and operators of the facility to be considered a family for the purposes of any law or zoning ordinance that relates to the residential use of property.
This bill would provide that the above provision does not apply to integral facilities and would provide that a city, county, or city and county whose application of zoning ordinances to a licensed facility is restricted by these provisions is an interested party with standing to pursue any available administrative appeals or otherwise seek judicial review of the licensing decision of the department and enforce the above provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 11834.02, 11834.09,

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Local Health Care District Law, authorizes the organization and incorporation of local health care districts and specifies the powers of those districts, including, among other things, the power to establish, maintain, and operate, or provide assistance in the operation of, one or more health facilities or health services, including, but not limited to, outpatient programs, services, and facilities; retirement programs, services, and facilities; chemical dependency programs, services, and facilities; or other health care programs, services, and facilities and activities at any location within or without the district for the benefit of the district and the people served by the district.
This bill would authorize the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District to include the eastern Coachella Valley region by requiring the district to submit a resolution of application to the Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission to initiate proceedings to expand the district. The bill would require the commission to order the expansion of the district subject to a vote of the registered voters residing within the territory to be annexed at an election following the completion of those proceedings. The bill would require the Board of Supervisors of the County of Riverside, upon direction by the commission, to place approval of district expansion on the ballot at the next countywide election following the completion of commission proceedings, including a public hearing. The bill would provide for expansion of the district upon voter approval, if a funding source sufficient to support the operations of the expanded district is, if required, approved, as specified. The bill would require the district to pay for election costs, as specified. By imposing new duties on the County of Riverside, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the board of directors of the district, following expansion, to adopt a resolution to increase the number of members of the district’s board of directors from 5 to 7, and to appoint 2 members who are residents of the territory annexed by the district to fill the vacant positions, as specified. Following the expansion of the board of directors, the bill would require the board of directors to adopt a resolution to divide the Desert Healthcare District into voting districts for the purpose of electing members of the board of directors from and by the electors of those voting districts beginning with the next district election after January 1, 2020, as specified.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the Desert Healthcare District maximize the use of its assets to provide direct health services to individuals within the district, as specified.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 32499) to Division 23 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to health care districts."

1109,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Chapter 728 of the Statutes of 2008 (SB 375) supports the goals of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) by requiring each of the state’s 18 metropolitan areas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. SB 375 calls on each metropolitan area to develop a sustainable communities strategy (SCS) to accommodate future population growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(b) One of the major components of SB 375 is to coordinate the regional housing needs allocation process with the regional transportation process while maintaining local authority over land use decisions. Thus, local officials are key decisionmakers in how the provisions of SB 375 are ultimately implemented.
(c) The nine-county Bay Area metropolitan area SCS, Plan Bay Area, was adopted in 2013 through a cooperative effort of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The Bay Area is expected to grow by 2,000,000 people over the next 25 years.
(d) Plan Bay Area provides a strategy for meeting 80 percent of the region’s future housing needs in priority development areas (PDAs). These are neighborhoods within walking distance of frequent transit service, offering a wide variety of housing options, and featuring amenities such as grocery stores, community centers, open space, and restaurants.
(e) There is a direct relationship between development planning for population growth in PDAs and the provision of open space and other amenities in these areas that will be required to support projected growth. San Francisco, like most cities, aims to provide adequate quality open space for the broader public health and quality of life of its citizens and workforce. As new development occurs, it serves additional residents and employees, who, in turn, require new, or expanded and enhanced, open space.
(f) A 2014 San Francisco Citywide Nexus Analysis documents this direct relationship between projected population growth and the cost of new open-space infrastructure to support growth. Providing recreation and open space, such as baseball diamonds, soccer fields, parks, playgrounds, tennis courts, flower gardens, community gardens, and greenways, is a capital intensive undertaking, especially in San Francisco where land availability is low and land prices are high.
(g) To meet the goals of SB 375, more of the future development is planned to be walkable and bikeable and close to public transit, jobs, schools, shopping, parks, recreation, and other amenities. Many of San Francisco’s PDAs are located in areas of San Francisco that both lack open space and are home to most of the city’s freeways. There are many parcels and
right-of-ways
rights-of-way
beneath and adjacent to these freeways and within PDAs that could be used for open-space purposes, yet currently the cost of leasing those lands from the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is prohibitively high.
(h) Thus, one strategy for supporting statewide SB 375 goals is to decrease the cost of providing additional open space by decreasing the cost of land. An innovative intergovernmental partnership would engage Caltrans in low-cost leases with San Francisco for areas under the freeways that overlap with PDAs and San Francisco would, in turn, take on the cost of building and maintaining much-needed new open space on those lands to support and accommodate future population growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(i) San Francisco has already demonstrated the viability of open-space uses under Caltrans freeways through various completed and successful projects. In the Mission Bay Area, San Francisco operates several recreational uses under Interstate 280, including volleyball and basketball courts, as well as pedestrian walkways. In the SoMa West area under the Route 101 Central Freeway, San Francisco leased two Caltrans parcels and built a very popular dog park and skatepark. The leases for these projects, which San Francisco negotiated carefully in partnership with Caltrans, could serve as models for a framework of more financially feasible open-space projects.
(j) With an under-freeway open-space framework in place, San Francisco could more readily meet its SB 375 goals. If this lower land cost opportunity was established, the under-freeway open-space projects could become financially feasible and San Francisco would be able to localize the decisionmaking process for these new open-space uses. This would allow San Francisco the flexibility to coordinate and plan locally and to more comprehensively plan to accommodate future population growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Section 104.16 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to read:
104.16.
(a) (1) Any airspace under a freeway, or real property acquired for highway purposes, in the City and County of San Francisco, that is not excess property, may be leased by the department to the city and county or a political subdivision of the city and county or a state agency for purposes of an emergency shelter or feeding program.
(2) Any airspace under or adjacent to a freeway, or other real property acquired for highway purposes, in the City and County of San Francisco, which is not excess property and is within a priority development area, shall be leased on a first right of refusal basis by the department to the city and county, a political subdivision of the city and county, or a state agency for park, recreational, or open-space purposes.
(b) (1) The lease amount for emergency shelter or feeding programs shall be for one dollar ($1) per month.
(2) For up to 10 parcels, the lease amount for park, recreational, or open-space purposes shall be 10 percent or less of the average fair market lease value of the applicable parcel.
(3) With respect to a lease for an emergency shelter or feeding program or for park, recreational, or open-space purposes, the lease amount may be paid in advance of the term covered in order to reduce the administrative costs associated with the payment of the monthly rental fee. The lease shall require the payment of an administrative fee not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per year, unless the department determines that a higher administrative fee is necessary, for the department’s cost of administering the lease.
(c) In the case of a lease for park, recreational, or open-space purposes, the lease shall require the lessee to fund and construct associated infrastructure, and to accept full responsibility for liability associated to the uses, except as otherwise provided in the lease. The lease shall require the lessee to be responsible for all nonhighway-related maintenance costs associated with those uses, except as otherwise provided in the lease. The lease shall authorize the lessee, at its discretion, to subsidize its associated maintenance costs through generation of revenue under a limited revenue generation model, such as from retail use located on or contiguous to the leased property, if any revenues generated that exceed the associated maintenance costs are shared with the state, at a rate not less than 50 percent of those excess revenues, with that amount to be deposited in the State Highway Account.
(d) As used in this section, “priority development area” means
a neighborhood within walking distance of frequent transit service that offers a wide variety of housing options and that features various amenities, including grocery stores, community centers, open space, and restaurants.
an area identified in a sustainable communities strategy
developed pursuant to Section 65080 of the Government Code.
(e) The Legislature finds and declares that the lease of real property pursuant to this section serves a public purpose.","Existing law provides that the Department of Transportation has full possession and control of the state highway system, including associated property. Existing law authorizes the department to lease certain property, including the area above or below a state highway, and certain property held for future highway purposes, to public agencies under specified terms and conditions, including specific provisions governing leases of airspace and other property in the City and County of San Francisco for purposes of an emergency shelter or feeding program, at a lease cost of $1 per month and payment of an administrative fee not to exceed $500 per year.
This bill would revise the provisions governing leases of department property in the City and County of San Francisco to also authorize leases of property for park, recreational, or open-space purposes, subject to certain additional terms and conditions. These park, recreational, and open-space leases would be subject to a requirement for the department to lease property located within a priority development area, as defined, to the city and county on a right of first refusal basis and, for up to 10 parcels, at a specified below market value lease amount, and a requirement for the lessee to be responsible for all associated nonhighway maintenance costs. The bill would provide for the lease to authorize the lessee to subsidize its maintenance costs through a limited revenue generation model, with any revenues generated above the maintenance costs to be shared with the state, as specified.","An act to amend Section 104.16 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to state highways."

(A) Determine the minimum contribution amount required to be received during the next calendar year for the fund to appear on the tax return for the taxable year that includes that next calendar year.
(B) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Franchise Tax Board shall estimate the amount of contributions to be received by using the actual amounts received and an estimate of the contributions that will be received by the end of that calendar year.
(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article shall be inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year and shall be repealed on December 1 of that year.
(3) For purposes of this section, the minimum contribution amount for a calendar year means two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the second calendar year after the first appearance of the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund on the personal income tax return or the minimum contribution amount as adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c).
(c) For each calendar year, beginning with the third calendar year after the first appearance of the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund on the personal income tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall adjust, on or before September 1 of that calendar year, the minimum contribution amount specified in subdivision (b) as follows:
(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.","Under existing law, taxpayers are allowed to contribute amounts in excess of their personal income tax liability for the support of various funds. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would allow a taxpayer to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund, which the bill would create. The bill would require moneys transferred to the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the University of California for distribution of grants to authorized diabetes research organizations, as defined, for the purpose of type 1 diabetes research, as provided.","An act to add and repeal Article 7.5 (commencing with Section 18781) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) More universal participation in postsecondary education in California is of vital public interest to ensure an informed citizenry, a functional democracy, a vibrant workforce, and a leading 21st century economy.
(b) Communities of color now comprise the new majority of California high school pupils. As cited by the University of California in an amicus brief filed in Fisher v. University of Texas, in 2012 high school graduates were 46.2 percent Latino, 30.5 percent white, 13.6 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 6.7 percent African American, and 0.7 percent Native American.
(c) Despite outreach programs and other efforts, historically disadvantaged groups remain underrepresented. These groups include communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ students, individuals from low-income and working class communities,access to higher education. This latter goal made California unique among the states and led to the creation of the most prominent higher education system in the nation and the world, a model that was replicated and revered. Undergirding this system and essential to its success was the commitment of California’s investment. Today, that commitment has changed as state resources that could have been made available for higher education have increasingly been dedicated to incarceration. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, from 2003 to 2010, inclusive, California’s prison population grew only 1 percent, while general fund expenditures on corrections increased by 26 percent.
(g) The Public Policy Institute of California projects that the state will fall short about 1,100,000 college graduates who will be in economic demand by 2030 if enrollment and graduation rates do not increase, and that highly educated workers from outside California are unlikely to fill this gap.
(h) Since 2012, when the California Postsecondary Education Commission was defunded, California has lacked a coordinating body for postsecondary education. The absence of such a body has reduced the ability of the state to effectively develop long-term plans for public postsecondary education and to fully engage with the public in the development of such plans.
(i) The Governor has acknowledged the well-established need for coordinating and guiding state higher education policy and has encouraged higher education stakeholders to explore alternative ways to more effectively improve coordination and development of higher education policy.
(j) Given this, and to ensure full and equitable accessibility to higher and postsecondary education, California must create and fund a Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to develop a written plan to ensure that public universities and colleges in California are tuition-free and affordable to all students, including low-income and underrepresented students, and have the capacity to provide universal participation for all high school graduates by the year 2030.

The hearings shall be held in geographically diverse regions of the state to solicit testimony of individuals, public interest groups, alumni organizations, or any other interested private groups and organizations as well as professors, administrators, students, representatives from historically underrepresented groups in public higher education, and others who are directly affected for the purpose of soliciting the input of these groups in the formulations of the commission’s recommendations.
(j) In addition, the commission shall, at a minimum, study, analyze, issue written recommendations, and report to the Legislature and to the Governor on all of the following:
(1) Establishing the need to create a public postsecondary education system that ensures universal access with the capacity to support universal participation of all high school graduates in California.
(2) Identifying the current enrollment capacity in public postsecondary education as compared to the enrollment capacity needed in public postsecondary education to ensure universal access and universal participation for all high school graduates in California.

(7) Determining the amount of increased investments in public postsecondary education necessary to support a mission of universal access and participation of all Californians. The increased investments shall take into account the additional resources needed to support the recommendations pursuant to paragraphs (2) to (6), inclusive. These recommendations shall identify expenditure requirements to support this objective and recommend additional revenue sources to finance this mission.
(8) The resources required to create an affordable and tuition-free education system in the California public postsecondary environment, with a first priority on supporting those students with the lowest incomes and least financial resources. This task shall include an analysis of not only tuition and fees, but a focus on additional college costs, such as books and supplies, food, housing, transportation, loan fees, child and dependent care, and other costs. The analysis shall incorporate the availability of federal, state, and campus-based financial aid efforts to offset these additional college costs to determine the extra resources needed to support all low-income and underrepresented California resident students.
(k) The commission shall publish its report by March 31, 2018. The report shall be transmitted to the fiscal and education policy committees of the Legislature, the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Director of Finance, and the Governor.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California is experiencing its worst water shortage crisis in modern history and increasing the use of recycled water, a supply that is not dependent on precipitation, is critical to increasing the flexibility of, and expanding, the state’s available water supply.
(b) The pressures on the Bay-Delta ecosystem, climate change, and continuing population growth have increased the challenges to the state in providing clean water needed for a healthy population and economy.
(c) Recycled water has been beneficially used in California for the past century for a variety of purposes, including agriculture, landscape irrigation, seawater barrier, industrial purposes, and groundwater recharge.
(d) Recycled water can significantly stretch California’s potable water supplies and help increase local water supply reliability. Currently, more than 3.5 million acre-feet of recyclable water is discharged annually to the ocean.
(e) The Assembly Committee on Water, Parks, and Wildlife, in March 2012, reported that the level of water supplies that could potentially be derived from recycled water is substantial.
(f) The National Academy of Sciences, in Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nation’s Water Supply Through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater, states that “in the U.S. approximately 12 billion gallons of municipal wastewater effluent is discharged each day to an ocean or estuary and that reusing these coastal discharges could directly augment public supplies by 27 percent.”
(g) The National Academy of Sciences further found that, unlike water that is discharged into a stream and potentially used by another downstream party, water discharged to the ocean is considered “‘irrecoverable’ and thus constitutes ‘new supply.’”
(h) In 2010, the State Water Resources Control Board adopted a recycled water policy for California with a goal of creating an additional 2.5 million acre-feet of recycled water by 2030.
(i) The delivery of shovel-ready recycled water projects can provide immediate drought relief to California’s struggling communities.
(j) Recycled water projects could and should be expedited by providing relief from the time consuming provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code), while still complying with all state and local laws and providing notice to the public and appropriate local and state agencies.
SEC. 2.
Section 21080.21.5 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
21080.21.5.
(a) This division does not apply to a project of less than eight miles in length within a public street, highway, or right-of-way for the construction and installation of a new recycled water pipeline, or the maintenance, repair, restoration, reconditioning, relocation, replacement, removal, or demolition of an existing recycled water pipeline.
(b) For the purposes of this section, “pipeline” means subsurface pipelines and subsurface or surface accessories or appurtenances to a pipeline, such as mains, traps, vents, cables, conduits, vaults, valves, flanges, manholes, and meters.
(c) For a project described in subdivision (a), the lead agency shall do all of the following:
(1) Before determining the applicability of this section to a project, hold a noticed public hearing to consider and adopt mitigation measures for potential traffic impacts of the project.
(2) File a notice of exemption of the project from this division with the Office of Planning and Research and in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the project is located within 20 days of the approval of the project. The county clerk shall post the notice within 24 hours of receipt.
(3) Ensure that the overlaying property owner has given permission to access the property, in the case of a right-of-way over private property, if access is not granted in the express terms of the right-of-way.
(4) Ensure the restoration of the public street, highway, or right-of-way to a condition consistent with all applicable local laws or regulations, or a negotiated agreement.
(d) The project applicant shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 60301) of Division 4 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations.
(e) This section does not apply to any of the following:
(1) A project that is a part of a larger project for the construction and installation of a new recycled water pipeline, or the maintenance, repair, restoration, reconditioning, relocation, replacement, removal, or demolition of an existing recycled water pipeline, that exceeds the length limitation set forth in subdivision (a).
(2) A project that is adjacent to another project for which a claim of exemption pursuant to this section has been made.
(3) A project that is located in a resource area, such as a park, open space, protected habitat area, or lands subject to a conservation easement.
(4) A project for which an excavation activity that is more than one-half mile in length at any one time will be undertaken.
(f)  This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA exempts specified pipeline projects from the above requirements.
This bill would, until January 1, 2020, additionally exempt from CEQA a project for the construction and installation of a new pipeline or the maintenance, repair, restoration, reconditioning, relocation, replacement, removal, or demolition of an existing pipeline, not exceeding 8 miles in length, for the distribution of recycled water within a public street, highway, or right-of-way and would require the lead agency to undertake specified activities, including the filing of a notice of exemption for the project with the Office of Planning and Research and the office of the county clerk of each county in which the project is located. The bill would require the lead agency, before determining the applicability of the exemption, to hold a noticed public hearing to consider and adopt mitigation measures for potential traffic impacts of the project. Because the lead agency would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for that exemption, and undertake specified activities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the county clerk to post the notice of exemption within 24 hours of receipt, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add and repeal Section 21080.21.5 of the Public Resources Code, relating to environmental quality."

(a) There is hereby established the Workforce Housing Pilot Program.
(b) Subject to the appropriation of funds for purposes of this chapter, the department shall award grant funding pursuant to the issuance of a notice of funding availability (NOFA) to eligible recipients that apply for financing. The department shall determine the appropriate amount of the grant for the purposes of accomplishing the intent of the Legislature.
(c) An eligible recipient shall do all of the following:
(1) Use the grant funds awarded to it for the predevelopment costs, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing projects or units within rental housing projects that serve persons and families of low or moderate income.

The eligible recipient shall submit any information requested by the Department of Finance for purposes of determining whether a hardship exists.
(f) On or before December 31 of each year in which funds are awarded pursuant to this chapter, the department shall provide a report to the Legislature regarding the number of grants awarded, a description of the projects funded, the number of units funded, and the amount of matching funds received.
(g) The program shall operate until all appropriated funds have been awarded.
(h) (1) Upon the depletion of appropriated funds and the termination of the pilot program pursuant to subdivision (g), the department shall submit a report to the Assembly and Senate committees on appropriations. The report shall evaluate the need for housing of persons and families of low or moderate income in areas that received grant funds pursuant to this chapter.

Existing law authorizes the department to make matching grants available to cities and counties, or a city and county, and existing charitable nonprofit organizations that have created, funded, and operated housing trust funds.
This bill would create the Workforce Housing Pilot Program, pursuant to which the department, subject to the appropriation of funds for that purpose, would award grant funding to eligible recipients, as defined, for the predevelopment costs, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing projects or units within rental housing projects that serve, and for providing downpayment assistance to, persons and families of low or moderate income. The bill would require all grant funds to be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis, unless the eligible recipient is suffering a hardship and is unable to generate the matching funds.
The bill would require the Department of Finance to determine whether an eligible recipient is suffering a hardship.
The bill would require the
department,

(d) If a petition is filed with the superior court under Section 13330, any stay in effect at the time of the filing of the petition shall remain in effect by operation of law for a period of 20 days from the date of the filing of that petition.
SEC. 3.
Section 13330 of the Water Code is amended to read:
13330.
(a) Not later than 30 days from the date of service of a copy of a decision or order issued by the state board under this division, other than a decision or order issued pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 13550) of Chapter 7, any aggrieved party may file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate for review of the decision or order. An aggrieved party must file a petition for reconsideration with the state board to exhaust that party’s administrative remedies only if the initial decision or order is issued under authority delegated to an officer or employee of the state board and the state board by regulation has authorized a petition for reconsideration. The state board shall order or deny reconsideration on a petition therefor not later than 90 days from the date the state board adopts the decision or order.
(b) A party aggrieved by a final decision or order of a regional board subject to review under Section 13320 may obtain review of the decision or order of the regional board in the superior court by filing in the court a petition for writ of mandate not later than 30 days from the date on which the state board denies review.
(c) The time for filing an action or proceeding subject to Section 21167 of the Public Resources Code for a person who seeks review of the regional board’s decision or order under Section 13320, or who seeks reconsideration under a state board regulation authorizing a petition for reconsideration, shall commence upon the state board’s completion of that review or reconsideration.
(d) If no aggrieved party petitions for writ of mandate within the time provided by this section, a decision or order of the state board or a regional board shall not be subject to review by any court.
(e) Except as provided in this section, Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall govern proceedings for which petitions are filed pursuant to this section. For the purposes of subdivision (c) of Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in any case involving the judicial review of a decision or order of the state board issued under Section 13320, or a decision or order of a regional board for which the state board denies review under Section 13320, other than a decision or order issued under Section 13323.
(f) Except as provided in this section, no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against the state board, a regional board, or any officer of the state board or a regional board to review, prevent, or enjoin any adjudicative proceeding under this division. Except as provided in this section and Section 13321, no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board to review, prevent, or enjoin a decision or order by the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board before a decision or order is issued and the procedures for administrative review of that decision or order have been exhausted.
(g) A party aggrieved by a decision or order issued by the state board under Article 7 (commencing with Section 13550) of Chapter 7 may petition for reconsideration or judicial review in accordance with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 1120) of Part 1 of Division 2.
(h) For purposes of this section, a decision or order includes a final action in an adjudicative proceeding and an action subject to Section 11352 of the Government Code, but does not include an action subject to Section 11353 of the Government Code or the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation under Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SEC. 4.
Section 13361 of the Water Code is amended to read:
13361.
(a) Every civil action brought under the provisions of this division at the request of a regional board or the state board shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the people of the State of California and any of those actions relating to the same discharge may be joined or consolidated.
(b) Any civil action brought pursuant to this division shall be brought in a county in which the discharge is made, or proposed to be made. However, any action by or against a city, city and county, county, or other public agency shall, upon motion of either party, be transferred to a county or city and county not a party to the action or to a county or city and county other than that in which the city or public agency is located.
(c) In any civil action brought pursuant to this division in which a regional board or the state board seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove at any stage of the proceeding that irreparable damage will occur should the temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction not be issued, or that the remedy at law is inadequate, and the temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction shall issue without those allegations and proof.","(1) Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, within 30 days of any action or failure to act by a California regional water quality control board under specified law, authorizes an aggrieved person to petition the State Water Resources Control Board to review that action or failure to act. Existing law authorizes the state board, in the case of such a review, upon notice and hearing, if a hearing is requested, to stay in whole or in part the effect of the decision and order of a regional board or of the state board.
This bill would expand that provision to authorize the state board to issue a stay in the case of review by the state board of a decision or order issued under authority delegated to an officer or employee of the state board where the state board by regulation has authorized a petition for reconsideration by the state board. The bill would generally require the state board to issue or deny the stay within 90 days of receipt of a request for stay, as specified, and would deem the request for stay denied if the state board fails to issue or deny the stay within the prescribed applicable period. The bill would authorize any aggrieved party, within 30 days of any order of the state board issuing or denying a stay or within 30 days of a stay being deemed denied, to file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate and would specify the law that governs those proceedings.
The act authorizes an aggrieved party to file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate for review of a decision or order issued by the state board or a regional board, and requires those proceedings to be governed by specified law. Existing law, except as specified, requires the court to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in cases involving the judicial review of a decision or order of the state board, or a decision or order of a regional board for which the state board denies review under the act.
This bill would require the state board to order or deny reconsideration on a petition not later than 90 days from the date the state board adopts the decision or order. The bill, except as specified, would prohibit any legal or equitable process from issuing in any proceeding in any court against the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board to review, prevent, or enjoin any adjudicative proceeding under the act, or a decision or order by the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board before a decision or order is issued and the procedures for administrative review of that decision or order have been exhausted.
(2) Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, requires the state board to administer provisions relating to the regulation of drinking water to protect public health. The state board’s duties include, but are not limited to, conducting research, studies, and demonstration programs relating to the provision of a dependable, safe supply of drinking water, enforcing the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and adopting and enforcing regulations. Existing law requires the state board to appoint a deputy director to oversee the issuance and enforcement of public water system permits and delegates certain authorities of the state board to the deputy director. The act authorizes the deputy director to issue an order directing certain actions whenever the deputy director determines that a person has violated or is violating the act, or any permit, regulation, or standard issued or adopted pursuant to the act. The act authorizes an aggrieved party 30 days after service of a copy of the order or decision to file with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate for review of the order or decision. The act requires that the evidence before the court consist of all relevant evidence that, in the judgment of the court, should be considered to effectuate and implement the act and requires, in every case, the court to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. The act prohibits a failure to file an action from precluding a party from challenging the reasonableness and validity of the decision or order in specified judicial proceedings.
This bill would provide that a decision or order of the state board is not subject to review by any court if no aggrieved party petitions for a writ of mandate within 30 days after service of a copy of an order or decision issued by the state board. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the evidence before the court consist of all relevant evidence that, in the judgment of the court, should be considered to effectuate and implement the act.","An act to amend Section 116700 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Sections 13321, 13330, and 13361 of the Water Code, relating to the State Water Resources Control Board."

Section 11325.3 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
11325.3.
(a) If, in the course of appraisal pursuant to Section 11325.2, it is determined that the recipient has not received his or her high school diploma or its equivalent, the recipient shall be eligible to participate in a high school equivalency program in order to complete the High School Equivalency Test, General Education Development Test, Test Assessing Secondary Completion, or any other high school equivalency test recognized by the State Department of Education.
(b) This section does not require a recipient to participate in a high school equivalency program. A recipient may choose to engage in a job club or a job search pursuant to Section 11325.22.
(c) Recipients eligible pursuant to this section shall not be required to participate in an assessment pursuant to Section 11325.4 prior to, or as a condition of, participation in a high school equivalency program.","Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families using federal, state, and county funds. Existing law establishes a 48-month lifetime limit of CalWORKs benefits for eligible adults, as specified. Existing law requires a recipient of CalWORKs to participate in certain welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility for 24 cumulative months, as specified, and to meet other federal requirements, as specified. Existing law provides that participation in certain activities is not counted against that 24-month period. Existing law requires the county to assign a CalWORKs recipient who lacks a high school diploma or its equivalent to participate in adult basic education, if the recipient has completed job search activities but did not find employment and the education is needed to become employed. Existing law also requires, in order for a recipient to engage in adult basic education in satisfaction of welfare-to-work requirements, the county to perform an assessment and develop a welfare-to-work plan that includes participation in the educational activity.
This bill would instead provide that if the county determines that a CalWORKs recipient has not received his or her high school diploma or its equivalent, the recipient may participate in a high school equivalency program in order to complete a high school equivalency test recognized by the State Department of Education, and that a specified amount of time participating in that activity would not count against the 24-month period described above for certain recipients. The bill would authorize a recipient to participate in a high school equivalency program in lieu of participating in a job search or job club, as specified, and would prohibit a county from requiring the recipient to participate in an assessment before the recipient may engage in a high school equivalency program in satisfaction of welfare-to-work requirements.","An act to amend Sections 11320.1, 11322.6, and 11322.85 of, and to add Section 11325.3 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."
1116,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declare as follows:
(a) Currently, bail agents, as defined in Section 1802 of the California Insurance Code, pay five hundred sixty-six dollars ($566) for a two-year license and one hundred seventy dollars ($170) for a license renewal. Bail permittees, as defined in Section 1802.5 of the Insurance Code, pay one thousand one hundred thirty-four dollars ($1,134) for a two-year license and seven hundred sixteen dollars ($716) for a license renewal. Bail solicitors, as defined in Section 1803 of the Insurance Code, pay five hundred sixty-six dollars ($566) for a two-year license and one hundred seventy dollars ($170) for a license renewal.
(b) Section 12978 of the Insurance Code states that the cumulative amount that fees may be increased or decreased shall be the amount necessary to provide sufficient moneys to carry out the projected workload of the Department of Insurance.
(c) In the past five years, the seriousness and the number of bail complaints received by the department have steadily increased.
(d) Despite the fact that bail products are less than 2 percent of the insurance market, bail complaints account for roughly 10 percent of the Reports of Suspected Violation workload of the department’s Enforcement Branch.
(e) The limited resources of the department do not currently allow for a sufficiently comprehensive bail enforcement program. Additional resources are needed to create an aggressive prevention, investigation, and prosecution program dedicated to eliminating illegal bail schemes, and additionally to increase outreach and education, particularly to bail professionals, on bail laws in California.
(f) Legislation is necessary that would provide the department with the resources to eliminate the bail complaint backlog, and more fully investigate illegal bail practices, by more appropriately aligning the licensing fees paid by bail agents, bail permittees, and bail solicitors, and by creating a Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund within the department. The fund would contain resources from increased licensing fees for bail professionals and from the imposition of a fee of ten dollars ($10) per bond transaction in California. A portion of the moneys in the fund would be distributed to district attorneys and city attorneys to prosecute these cases.
(g) Effective bail enforcement by the department produces numerous benefits to both the bail bond industry and consumers who purchase bail products. Consumers are protected from predatory tactics by unscrupulous bail agents, and the bail industry benefits from improved customer confidence.
(h) A well-regulated bail industry reduces business and transaction costs for industry members, who benefit when business partners perceive less risk from engagement with the bail industry, and it fosters competitive bail markets by ensuring a level playing field for all members of the bail industry.
SEC. 2.
Section 1811 of the Insurance Code is amended to read:

(d) For filing an application for examination, or reexamination, twenty-four dollars ($24).
(e) For a renewal application, a fee of
thirty-five dollars ($35)
three hundred forty dollars ($340)
per year. In the case of a bail agent with more than one valid notice of appointment on file, the fee to be charged pursuant to this subdivision shall be the fee provided herein multiplied by the number of insurers whose valid appointments are on file at the date the document is filed unless the bail agent in that document advises the commissioner of his or her intent to terminate the appointment of one or more of those insurers, in which event the fee shall be based upon the number for insurers remaining.
(f) For a bail solicitor’s renewal application, a fee of
thirty-five dollars ($35)
three hundred forty dollars ($340)
per year.
(g) For a bail permittee’s renewal application, a fee of
one hundred forty-eight dollars ($148) per year.
one thousand one hundred thirty-two dollars ($1,132).
(h) At the time of filing an application for a license, if a qualifying examination is required for issue or in connection with the license, the fee for filing the first application to take the qualifying examination shall be paid at the time of filing application for the license.
(i) For filing application or request for approval of a true or fictitious name pursuant to Section 1724.5, twelve dollars ($12), except that there shall be no fee when the name is contained in an original application.
(j) For filing a bond required by this chapter, except when the bond constitutes part of an original application, ten dollars ($10).
(k) For filing a first amendment to an application, six dollars ($6).
(l) For filing a second and each subsequent amendment to an application, twelve dollars ($12).
SEC. 3.
Section 1824 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
1824.
(a) The Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund is hereby created as a special account within the Insurance Fund. Each surety insurer or bail permittee admitted and authorized to execute an undertaking of bail in this state through a licensed bail licensee shall pay a fee per bail bond transaction, not to exceed ten dollars ($10) for each bail bond posted in this state. The revenue from this fee shall be deposited into the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund.
(b) Moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund shall be distributed, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to fund the reasonable costs incurred in regulating entities involved in the undertaking of bail as described in this section. Moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund shall be distributed by the commissioner as follows:
(1) Seventy percent of these funds shall be distributed within the department for consumer enforcement and protection purposes related to bail transactions, including, but not limited to:
(A) Investigating and prosecuting unlawful conduct by bail licensees, or a person or entity purporting to solicit or negotiate in respect to execution or delivery of an undertaking of bail or bail bond, or execute or deliver an undertaking of bail or bail bond, or matters subsequent to the execution of an undertaking of bail or bail bond contract and arising out of it.
(B) Responding to consumer inquiries and complaints related to bail transactions.

The Legislature finds and declares that Section 3 of this act, which adds Section 1824 to the Insurance Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to ensure that criminal investigations are not frustrated or hindered, it is necessary to limit the public’s right of access to information submitted to the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to this act concerning criminal investigations.","Existing law provides for the issuance of bail licenses under the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner for bail agents, bail permittees, and bail solicitors. Existing law requires persons soliciting or negotiating the execution or delivery of an undertaking of bail on behalf of a surety insurer to be licensed as a bail agent. Existing law requires the commissioner to charge and collect specified fees for an application for a new or renewed bail license by a bail agent, bail permittee, or bail solicitor.
This bill would increase the fees for an application for a new or renewed bail license, as specified. The bill would require each surety insurer or bail permittee to pay a fee, not to exceed $10 per bail bond transaction. These fees would go to the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund, created as a special account in the Insurance Fund. The bill would provide that moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund be distributed by the commissioner, upon appropriation, to fund the reasonable costs incurred in regulating entities involved in the undertaking of bail, as specified. The bill would provide that if the total amount in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund ever exceeds $8,000,000, then the commissioner shall reduce the amount of the assessment, as specified. The bill would authorize the commissioner to develop guidelines to implement or clarify these provisions. The bill would require the commissioner to provide an annual report on the department’s Internet Web site including various information, as specified. The bill would make related legislative findings and declarations.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to amend Section 1811 of, and to add Section 1824 to, the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."

(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) California is heavily dependent on natural gas.
(2) The storage and delivery of natural gas relies on aging infrastructure that is prone to leaks that can damage the environment and imperil public health.
(3) Natural gas is a fossil fuel and a major source of global warming pollution and the pollutants that cause air pollution, including smog.
(4) California’s growing population and economy will put a strain on energy supplies and threaten the ability of the state to meet its global warming goals unless specific steps are taken to reduce demand and generate energy cleanly and efficiently.
(5) Water heating for domestic and industrial use relies almost entirely on natural gas and accounts for a significant percentage of the state’s natural gas consumption.
(6) Solar thermal systems represent the major untapped natural gas saving potential in California.
(7) In addition to financial and energy savings, solar water heating systems can help protect against future gas and electricity shortages and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.
(8) Solar thermal systems can also help preserve the environment and protect public health by reducing air pollution, including carbon dioxide, a leading global warming gas, and nitrogen oxide, a precursor to smog.
(9) Growing demand for these technologies will create jobs in California as well as promote greater energy independence, protect consumers from rising energy costs, and result in cleaner air.
(10) Installing solar thermal systems in disadvantaged communities can provide local economic benefits while advancing the state’s clean energy goals and policies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.
(11) It is in the interest of the State of California to promote solar thermal systems and other technologies that directly reduce demand for natural gas in homes and businesses.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to build a mainstream market for solar thermal systems that directly reduces demand for natural gas in homes, businesses, schools, industrial and government buildings, and buildings occupied by nonprofit organizations.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the solar thermal system incentives created by this article should lead to cost-effective investments by gas customers. Gas customers will recoup the cost of these investments through lower energy bills as a result of avoiding purchases of natural gas.

(b) The commission shall consider federal tax credits and other incentives available for this technology when determining the appropriate rebate amount.
(c) The commission shall consider the impact of rebates for solar thermal systems pursuant to this article on existing incentive programs for energy efficiency technology.
(d) In coordination with the commission, the Energy Commission shall consider, when appropriate, coupling rebates for solar thermal systems with complementary energy efficiency technologies, including, but not limited to, efficient hot water heating tanks and tankless or on demand hot water systems that can be installed in addition to the solar thermal system.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act or because costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007, until August 1, 2017, requires the Public Utilities Commission, if it determines that a solar water heating program is cost effective for ratepayers and in the public interest, to implement a program to promote the installation of 200,000 solar water heating systems in homes, businesses, and buildings or facilities of eligible customer classes receiving natural gas service throughout the state by 2017. The act establishes the maximum funding for the program, for the collective service territories of all gas corporations, at $250,000,000. The act, until August 1, 2017, requires the governing body of each publicly owned utility providing gas service to retail end-use customers to adopt, implement, and finance a solar water heating system incentive program to encourage the installation of 200,000 solar water heating systems by 2017.
This bill would revise the program to, among other things, promote the installation of solar thermal systems throughout the state, set the maximum funding for the program between January 1, 2017, and July 31, 2022, at $250,000,000, reserve 50% of the total program budget for the installation of solar thermal systems in low-income residential housing or in buildings in disadvantaged communities, and extend the operation of the program through July 31, 2022. Because a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission implementing these revisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the governing body of each publicly owned utility providing gas service, until August 1, 2022, to adopt, implement, and finance a solar thermal system incentive program. Because the bill would extend the obligations of a publicly owned electric utility to adopt, implement, and finance the program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","An act to amend Sections 2861, 2863, 2864, 2865, 2866, 2867, and 2867.3 of, to amend and renumber Section 2862 of, to repeal Sections 2860, 2867.1, and 2867.2 of, and to repeal and add Section 2867.4 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

(i) Except as provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.

(k) Nothing contained in this part is intended to alter or otherwise affect the exclusive remedy provided by the workers’ compensation provisions of this code for liability against an employer for the compensation for any injury to or death of an employee arising out of and in the course of employment.

Nothing in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.
(2) No action shall be brought under this part for any violation of a posting, notice, agency reporting, or filing requirement of this code, except where the filing or reporting requirement involves mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting.
(h) No action may be brought under this section by an aggrieved employee if the agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within the timeframes set forth in Section 2699.3 for a violation of the same section or sections of the Labor Code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or others or initiates a proceeding pursuant to Section 98.3.
(i) Except as provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.
(j) Civil penalties recovered under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) shall be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes.
(k) Nothing contained in this part is intended to alter or otherwise affect the exclusive remedy provided by the workers’ compensation provisions of this code for liability against an employer for the compensation for any injury to or death of an employee arising out of and in the course of employment.
(l) The superior court shall review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed settlement agreement pursuant to this part.
(m) This section shall not apply to the recovery of administrative and civil penalties in connection with the workers’ compensation law as contained in Division 1 (commencing with Section 50) and Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200), including, but not limited to, Sections 129.5 and 132a.
(n) The agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, or agencies may promulgate regulations to implement this part.","The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to recover specified civil penalties, that would otherwise be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, on behalf of the employee and other current or former employees for the violation of certain provisions affecting employees. The act authorizes a court to exercise the same discretion to assess a civil penalty as the agency, subject to the same limitations and conditions. The act also authorizes a court, in any action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, to award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount specified by the act if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.
This bill would authorize a court to dismiss an action as to an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, if, after notice and hearing, the court finds that the aggrieved employee suffered no appreciable physical or economic harm.","An act to amend Section 2699 of the Labor Code, relating to employment."

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","The California Constitution requires the Legislature to provide for the disqualification of electors while mentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony. Existing law provides that a person is entitled to register to vote if he or she is a United States citizen, a resident of California, not imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony, and at least 18 years of age at the time of the next election.
This bill, for purposes of determining who is entitled to register to vote, would define imprisoned as currently serving a state or federal prison sentence and would define parole as a term of supervision by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The bill would clarify that conviction does not include a juvenile adjudication.
Existing law requires any program adopted by a county pursuant to certain provisions that is designed to encourage the registration of electors, with respect to any printed literature or media announcements made in connection with the program, to contain a statement that a person entitled to register to vote must be a United States citizen, a California resident, not in prison or on parole for conviction of a felony, and at least 18 years of age at the time of the election.

1125,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The public has a direct and immediate interest in ensuring its money is spent efficiently and wisely. Through direct cash payments and exemptions from paying taxes, nonprofit hospitals receive billions in taxpayer funds.
(b) The compensation packages of chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities that operate under nonprofit corporate status are often excessive, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the corporations’ charitable purposes, as revealed by compensation surveys and other sources.
(c) Payment of excessive compensation to executives, managers, and administrators undermines the purposes of nonprofit corporations because it results in fewer funds being available for their charitable purposes, and it is often the case that the hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities that pay the most excessive compensation also provide less charitable care than comparable institutions that pay reasonable compensation to their executives, managers, and administrators.
(d) Existing requirements of law do not adequately ensure that assets held for charitable purposes are not instead used to enrich executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities through payment of excessive compensation.
(e) The compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of for-profit hospitals in California are often excessive, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the provision of high-quality, affordable medical care, by diverting funds that could be used to expand access to affordable medical care for all Californians.
(f) Chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators at hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities who are also compensated for their positions on boards of directors of publicly traded companies, privately held companies, and nonprofit organizations risk spending time away from their primary responsibilities to the detriment of high-quality, affordable medical care.
(g) In order to properly assess the scope of excessive compensation packages in the nonprofit hospital sector and to inform policy decisions related to escalating health care costs, it is necessary to understand excessive compensation among private hospitals.
(h) In order to ensure equal opportunity and compensation among health care workers in California, it is necessary to understand compensation by job classification and by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
(i) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals are consistent with the goal of providing affordable, high-quality medical care to all Californians.
(j) The intent of the Legislature in enacting this act is also to ensure that compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities are consistent with the charitable purposes of those nonprofits and are reasonable and not excessive in light of the substantial public benefit that the state tax exemption for nonprofit organizations conveys.
(k) It is also the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that compensation packages for employees of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals are not discriminatory based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities, including general acute care hospitals, by the State Department of Public Health.
This bill would require covered hospitals and medical entities, as defined, to annually submit to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development an executive compensation report for every executive whose annual compensation exceeds a specified threshold. The bill would also require each covered hospital or medical entity with 100 or more employees to annually report compensation information by employee classification and by gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, and gender identity, as self-reported by its employees. The bill would require specified information to be included in these reports, and would require that certain reports be attested to under penalty of perjury. Because a violation thereof would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the office to impose a reasonable fee to cover the costs of implementation and administration of these provisions. The bill would require the office to post these reports on its Internet Web site.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(b) Unless otherwise permitted by law, a miscellaneous, nonsafety employee, who is not a new member as defined in Section 7522.04, shall be subject to the benefit formula in Section 7522.20 if employed by a public employer that did not contract with this system to provide retirement benefits on or before December 31, 2012.
(c) Pensionable compensation used to calculate the defined benefit pursuant to this section shall be limited as described in Section 7522.10.","The Public Employees’ Retirement Law authorizes a public agency to participate in, and make all or part of its employees members of, the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) by a contract entered into between its governing body and the board of administration of the system. The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013, as specified.
This bill would authorize a public agency that has contracted with the board of administration of PERS to offer an alternative formula from that required by PEPRA, to be applicable to miscellaneous, nonsafety employees hired after January 1, 2017,
and who are new members, as defined,
if specified contingencies are satisfied, including that the agency and representative employee organization have agreed to its application in a valid memorandum of understanding.
The bill would require that miscellaneous, nonsafety employees who are not new members, as defined, if they are employed by a public employer that did not contract with PERS prior to December 31, 2012, be covered by the default benefit formula under PEPRA. The bill would specify what is pensionable compensation for these purposes.","An act to amend Section 7522.20 of, and to add Section 21354.6 to, the Government Code, relating to public employees’ retirement."

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to ensure that low-income communities immediately receive the dental care they desperately lack as soon as possible by removing barriers to available and unused special funds for dentists who seek to serve designated underserved populations, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Under the Dental Practice Act, the Dental Board of California is responsible for the licensure and regulation of dentists. Existing law establishes the Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program of 2002 to assist dentists who practice in an underserved area with loan repayment pursuant to an agreement between the board and the dentist, as specified. Existing law governs eligibility, application, selection, placement, and repayment for the program, and authorizes the board to adopt standards to implement the program relating to eligibility, placement, and termination. Existing law creates the Dentally Underserved Account within the State Dentistry Fund and moneys in the account are continuously appropriated for purposes of the program.
This bill would require that the program be known as the California Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program and would revise program provisions regarding eligibility, application, selection, and placement. The bill would require the board to develop a process for repayment of loans or grants disbursed if the participant is terminated from the program or is not able to complete the required service obligation, as provided.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 1970, 1970.5, and 1973 of, to amend and repeal Section 1976 of, and to repeal and add Sections 1971, 1972, and 1975 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to dentistry, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Foothill Feeder below Castaic Dam in the County of Los Angeles is the primary conduit for water from the State Water Project for the southern California region served by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is a public agency comprised of 26 member public agencies – 14 cities, 11 municipal water districts, and one county water authority – and provides water to approximately 19 million people in the Counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura.
(b) Water supplies from the State Water Project are a critical part of southern California’s water supply portfolio, and any interruption of that supply must be minimized to ensure delivery of clean and reliable water supplies for municipal and industrial uses, including health and human safety, and to water agencies and cities that rely upon water supply deliveries from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
(c) Periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair, including emergency repairs, require that all or a portion of the Foothill Feeder be dewatered into the Santa Clara River and certain of its tributaries where unarmored threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus williamsoni) may be present during these activities. Thus, to protect southern California water supplies, the incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback must be permitted for the periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair of the Foothill Feeder.
(d) During the permit application process pursuant to Section 2081.10 of the Fish and Game Code, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall consult with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service with respect to feasible mitigation and conservation measures that may be adopted pursuant to that section. These measures shall be consistent with any state or federal wildlife agency recovery plan adopted for the long-term conservation of the unarmored threespine stickleback in the Santa Clara River watershed.
SEC. 2.
Section 2081.10 is added to the Fish and Game Code, to read:
2081.10.
(a) The department may authorize, under this chapter, the incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus williamsoni) attributable to the periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair, including emergency repair, of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California’s Foothill Feeder water supply facility from Castaic Dam to the Joseph Jensen Treatment Plant in the County of Los Angeles, contingent upon the fulfillment of the following conditions:
(1) The department determines that the requirements of subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 2081 are satisfied for the take of the unarmored threespine stickleback.
(2) The department ensures that all further measures necessary to satisfy the conservation standard of subdivision (d) of Section 2805 are incorporated into the project.
(3) The take authorization provides for the development and implementation, in cooperation with the department, of an adaptive management plan for monitoring the effectiveness of, and adjusting as necessary, the measures to minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of the authorized take and to satisfy the conservation standard of subdivision (d) of Section 2805.
(4) A biologist who has substantial relevant experience evaluating impacts to inland fisheries is on duty whenever an activity is conducted that may affect the unarmored threespine stickleback.
(5) The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California consults with the department to consider feasible measures to avoid and minimize incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback. For purposes of this paragraph, “feasible” has the same meaning as defined in Section 15364 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations.
(b) The take authorization shall cover any incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback attributable to the periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair, including emergency repair, of the Foothill Feeder that may occur in the following locations:
(1) Within the Santa Clara River, from the Bouquet Canyon Road Bridge to a point located 4,000 feet downstream of where Commerce Center Drive, as of January 1, 2016, dead-ends adjacent to the Santa Clara River.
(2) From the confluence with the Santa Clara River upstream to the following locations:
(A) In Charlie Canyon to a point 1,000 feet upstream of the Foothill Feeder facility dewatering structure.
(B) In San Francisquito Creek to the Copper Hill Drive bridge.
(C) In Placerita Creek to the Hacienda Lane crossing.
(D) In Bouquet Creek to the Newhall Ranch Road Bridge.
(c) The take authorization shall also cover any incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback that may occur in the course of implementing mitigation or conservation actions required in the permit issued pursuant to subdivision (a) as may be modified through an adaptive management plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).
(d) The permit issued pursuant to subdivision (a) shall include conditions that cover biological and scientific considerations including, but not limited to, criteria for the handling of stranded fish and their relocation into suitable habitat, the dewatering of the Foothill Feeder, and the reasonable and feasible mimicking of streamflows. The permit conditions shall be in compliance with the project description, mitigation measures, and release plan set forth in the certified environmental impact report known as the “Foothill Feeder Repair and Future Inspections Project Environmental Impact Report, January 2005, State Clearinghouse Number 2005071082.” The permit conditions are subject to amendment when required by the adaptive management plan or when modified by a subsequent final environmental document pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
(e) This section shall not be construed to exempt from any other law the periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair of the Foothill Feeder.
(f) If the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California receives a permit under this section, the permit shall require the district to report to the department within six months after every dewatering of the Foothill Feeder. The report shall address compliance with the permit conditions and the effectiveness of the adaptive management plan in contributing to the conservation of the unarmored threespine stickleback. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall ensure that each report is made available to the public.
(g) As used in this section, “modification” does not include alterations to expand the maximum physical capacity of the Foothill Feeder to deliver water.

Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies, as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved agencies and to fulfill the enforceable obligations of those agencies. Existing law also provides for various economic development programs that foster community sustainability and community and economic development initiatives throughout the state.
Existing law authorizes certain local agencies to form a community revitalization and investment authority (authority) within a community revitalization and investment area, as defined, to carry out provisions of the Community Redevelopment Law in that area for purposes related to, among other things, infrastructure, affordable housing, and economic revitalization.

This bill would authorize the calculation to be made with a combination of census tracts and census block groups. The bill would also revise the conditions to require, among other things, an annual median household income that is less than 80% of the statewide, countywide, or citywide annual median household income. The bill would also authorize an authority to carry out a community revitalization plan if the census tract or census block groups within the community revitalization and investment area are within a disadvantage community, as prescribed.
Existing law authorizes certain entities that receive ad valorem property taxes to adopt a resolution in a specified manner to allocate their share of tax increment funds within the area covered by a community revitalization plan to the authority.

(C) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Franchise Tax Board shall estimate the amount of contributions to be received by using the actual amounts received and an estimate of the contributions that will be received by the end of that calendar year.
(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article shall be inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year and shall be repealed on December 1 of that year.

(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.

This bill would repeal these provisions regarding contributions for the support of the California Senior Legislature Fund and would instead allow a taxpayer, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, which the bill would create. This bill would require moneys transferred to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the California Senior Legislature for the purpose of funding the activities of the California Senior Legislature, as provided.

(2) The administrative cost allowance shall be 5 percent of the property tax allocated to the successor agency on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule covering the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012. The administrative cost allowance shall be up to 3 percent of the property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund for each fiscal year thereafter ending on June 30, 2016. However, the administrative cost allowance shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in any fiscal year, unless this amount is reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency.
(3) Commencing July 1, 2016, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the administrative cost allowance shall be up to 3 percent of the actual property tax distributed to the successor agency by the county auditor-controller in the preceding fiscal year for payment of approved enforceable obligations, reduced by the successor agency’s administrative cost allowance and loan repayments made to the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency that it succeeded pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 34191.4 during the preceding fiscal year. However, the administrative cost allowance shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in any fiscal year, unless this amount is reduced by the oversight board or by agreement between the successor agency and the department.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), commencing July 1, 2016, a successor agency’s annual administrative costs shall not exceed 50 percent of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the preceding fiscal year, which latter amount shall be reduced by the successor agency’s administrative cost allowance and loan repayments made to the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency that it succeeded pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 34191.4 during the preceding fiscal year. This limitation applies to administrative costs whether paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but does not apply to administrative costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds, or, in the case of a successor agency that is a designated local authority, from sources other than property tax.
(5) The administrative cost allowance shall be approved by the oversight board and shall be the sole funding source for any legal expenses related to civil actions brought by the successor agency or the city, county, or city and county that created the former redevelopment agency, including writ proceedings, contesting the validity of this part or Part 1.8 (commencing with Section 34161) or challenging acts taken pursuant to these parts. Employee costs associated with work on specific project implementation activities, including, but not limited to, construction inspection, project management, or actual construction, shall be considered project-specific costs and shall not constitute administrative costs.
(c) “Designated local authority” shall mean a public entity formed pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 34173.
(d) (1) “Enforceable obligation” means any of the following:
(A) Bonds, as defined by Section 33602 and bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 5850) of Division 6 of Title 1 of the Government Code, including the required debt service, reserve set-asides, and any other payments required under the indenture or similar documents governing the issuance of the outstanding bonds of the former redevelopment agency. A reserve may be held when required by the bond indenture or when the next property tax allocation will be insufficient to pay all obligations due under the provisions of the bond for the next payment due in the following half of the calendar year.
(B) Loans of moneys borrowed by the redevelopment agency for a lawful purpose, to the extent they are legally required to be repaid pursuant to a required repayment schedule or other mandatory loan terms.
(C) Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state or obligations imposed by state law,
specifically including, but not limited to, federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base as confirmed by the 1990 Joint Powers Agreement providing for member contributions and by the 1990 cooperation agreement pass with a state water contractor,
other than passthrough payments that are made by the county auditor-controller pursuant to Section 34183, or legally enforceable payments required in connection with the agencies’ employees, including, but not limited to, pension payments, pension obligation debt service, unemployment payments, or other obligations conferred through a collective bargaining agreement. Costs incurred to fulfill collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who performed work directly on behalf of the former redevelopment agency shall be considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. The obligations to employees specified in this subparagraph shall remain enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds for any employee to whom those obligations apply if that employee is transferred to the entity assuming the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to Section 34176. The successor agency or designated local authority shall enter into an agreement with the housing entity to reimburse it for any costs of the employee obligations.
(D) Judgments or settlements entered by a competent court of law or binding arbitration decisions against the former redevelopment agency, other than passthrough payments that are made by the county auditor-controller pursuant to Section 34183. Along with the successor agency, the oversight board shall have the authority and standing to appeal any judgment or to set aside any settlement or arbitration decision.
(E) Any legally binding and enforceable agreement or contract that is not otherwise void as violating the debt limit or public policy. However, nothing in this act shall prohibit either the successor agency, with the approval or at the direction of the oversight board, or the oversight board itself from terminating any existing agreements or contracts and providing any necessary and required compensation or remediation for such termination. Titles of or headings used on or in a document shall not be relevant in determining the existence of an enforceable obligation.
(F) (i) Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, in accordance with this part, including, but not limited to, agreements concerning litigation expenses related to assets or obligations, settlements and judgments, and the costs of maintaining assets prior to disposition, and agreements to purchase or rent office space, equipment and supplies, and pay-related expenses pursuant to Section 33127 and for carrying insurance pursuant to Section 33134. Beginning January 1, 2016, any legal expenses related to civil actions, including writ proceedings, contesting the validity of this part or Part 1.8 (commencing with Section 34161) or challenging acts taken pursuant to these parts shall only be payable out of the administrative cost allowance.
(ii) A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for payment of legal expenses related to civil actions initiated by the successor agency, including writ proceedings, contesting the validity of this part or Part 1.8 (commencing with Section 34161) or challenging acts taken pursuant to these parts. If the successor agency obtains a final judicial determination granting the relief requested in the action, the funds provided by the sponsoring entity for legal expenses related to successful causes of action pled by the successor agency shall be deemed an enforceable obligation for repayment under the terms set forth in subdivision (h) of Section 34173. If the successor agency does not receive a final judicial determination granting the relief requested, the funds provided by the sponsoring entity shall be considered a grant by the sponsoring entity and shall not qualify for repayment as an enforceable obligation.
(G) Amounts borrowed from, or payments owing to, the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency, which had been deferred as of the effective date of the act adding this part; provided, however, that the repayment schedule is approved by the oversight board. Repayments shall be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund established pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 34176 as a housing asset and shall be used in a manner consistent with the affordable housing requirements of the Community Redevelopment Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000)).
(2) For purposes of this part, “enforceable obligation” does not include any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. However, written agreements entered into (A) at the time of issuance, but in no event later than December 31, 2010, of indebtedness obligations, and (B) solely for the purpose of securing or repaying those indebtedness obligations may be deemed enforceable obligations for purposes of this part.

Notwithstanding this paragraph, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created it, within two years of the date of creation of the redevelopment agency, may be deemed to be enforceable obligations. Notwithstanding this paragraph, an agreement entered into by the redevelopment agency prior to June 28, 2011, is an enforceable obligation if the agreement relates to state highway infrastructure improvements to which the redevelopment agency committed funds pursuant to Section 33445. Notwithstanding this paragraph, an agreement between the city, county, or city and county that created the former redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency is an enforceable obligation if that agreement requires the former redevelopment agency to repay or fulfill an outstanding loan or development obligation imposed by a grant or loan awarded or issued by a federal agency, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, to the city, county, or city and county which subsequently loaned or provided those funds to the former redevelopment agency.
(3) Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies, to perform services or provide funding for governmental or private services or capital projects outside of redevelopment project areas that do not provide benefit to the redevelopment project and thus were not properly authorized under Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000) shall be deemed void on the effective date of this part; provided, however, that such contracts or agreements for the provision of housing properly authorized under Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000) shall not be deemed void.
(e) “Indebtedness obligations” means bonds, notes, certificates of participation, or other evidence of indebtedness, issued or delivered by the redevelopment agency, or by a joint exercise of powers authority created by the redevelopment agency, to third-party investors or bondholders to finance or refinance redevelopment projects undertaken by the redevelopment agency in compliance with the Community Redevelopment Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000)).

(h) “Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule” means the document setting forth the minimum payment amounts and due dates of payments required by enforceable obligations for each six-month fiscal period until June 30, 2016, as provided in subdivision (m) of Section 34177. On and after July 1, 2016, “Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule” means the document setting forth the minimum payment amounts and due dates of payments required by enforceable obligations for each fiscal year as provided in subdivision (o) of Section 34177.
(i) “School entity” means any entity defined as such in subdivision (f) of Section 95 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(l) “Property taxes” include all property tax revenues, including those from unitary and supplemental and roll corrections applicable to tax increment.
(m) “Department” means the Department of Finance unless the context clearly refers to another state agency.
(n) “Sponsoring entity” means the city, county, or city and county, or other entity that authorized the creation of each redevelopment agency.

(p) From July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, inclusive, “housing entity administrative cost allowance” means an amount of up to 1 percent of the property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund on behalf of the successor agency for each applicable fiscal year, but not less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) per fiscal year.
(1) If a local housing authority assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 34176, then the housing entity administrative cost allowance shall be listed by the successor agency on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. Upon approval of the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule by the oversight board and the department, the housing entity administrative cost allowance shall be remitted by the successor agency on each January 2 and July 1 to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 34176.
(2) If there are insufficient moneys in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund in a given fiscal year to make the payment authorized by this subdivision, the unfunded amount may be listed on each subsequent Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule until it has been paid in full. In these cases the five-year time limit on the payments shall not apply.","Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law defines the term “enforceable obligation” for these purposes to mean, among other things, preexisting obligations to the state or obligations imposed by state law, other than specified passthrough payments that are made by the county auditor-controller.
This bill would expressly include federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base pursuant to specified agreements as a preexisting obligation to the state or obligation imposed by state law.","An act to amend Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to redevelopment."

1135,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Voting, especially at the local level, is the cornerstone of democracy. However, voter turnout has declined consistently in recent decades. In the most recent general election conducted in November 2014, voter turnout was only 42 percent of eligible voters, representing a historic low.
(2) Research shows that early voting experiences are important determinants of future voting behavior. The formation of voting habits begins when individuals reach voting age and experience their first elections.
(3) Local political decisions have great influence on the lives of 16 and 17 year olds. As such, 16 and 17 year olds deserve to vote, and research shows they are mature enough to do so.
(4) Lowering the voting age for certain local elections will provide an opportunity to engage young voters on issues that directly affect them and will lead to increased voter turnout, thereby strengthening our democracy. As an example, Norway and Austria recently permitted 16 and 17 year olds to vote in certain elections and research shows that voter turnout for 16 and 17 year olds was much higher than older first-time voters.
(5) Lowering the voting age will also increase the demand for better civics education in schools, thereby significantly increasing political engagement.
(6) It is unclear whether existing state law permits charter cities to lower the voting age for local elections. Therefore, this bill seeks to provide legal certainty to those local governments considering this issue.
(b) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that:
(1) Charter cities and charter cities and counties be permitted, and not required, to authorize 16 year olds to vote in school district governing board elections as a means of increasing voter turnout and civil participation.
(2) This section does not create a state-mandated local program because any costs imposed by this act shall be paid for by the charter city or charter city and county or the school district.

Existing law requires the comprehensive school safety plan to include, among other things, the identification of appropriate strategies and programs that will provide or maintain a high level of school safety and address the school’s procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety, including the development of specified procedures and policies.
This bill would include a coach of the school, if the school has a coach, to the list of specified members to serve on a school safety planning committee. The bill would additionally require a comprehensive school safety plan to include any other strategies aimed at the prevention of, response to, and education about, potential incidents involving crime, violence, or medical emergency on the school
campus, including sanctioned activities before and after school.

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 32280, 32281, and 32282 of the Education Code, relating to school safety."
1137,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(1) The waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever-increasing demand.
(2) Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development, among other benefits.
(3) Landscape design, installation, maintenance, and management can and should be water efficient.
(4) Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and that the right does not extend to the waste or unreasonable use of water.
(5) Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed, and maintained with a watershed-based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions, provide benefits, and realize sustainability goals such as the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and recycling goals, and conserve energy. These landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes.
(6) Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat, and aesthetic benefits.
(7) Energy use can be minimized by using efficient irrigation systems, reducing reliance on petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate-appropriate edible plants and shade trees in urban areas.
(8) Water can be conserved by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate-appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.
(9) Air and water quality can be protected by using low- or zero-emissions outdoor equipment, reducing landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and local sources of material, using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment, and designing landscapes to prevent erosion.
(10) Existing habitat can be protected and new habitat created by choosing local native plants and climate-adapted plants, avoiding invasive plants, and using environmentally sound integrated pest management with the least toxic methods as a first course of action.
(11) Stormwater management practices can minimize runoff and increase infiltration that recharges groundwater and improves water quality. Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and grading design plans to minimize runoff and increase onsite rainwater retention and infiltration should be encouraged.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program furthers and accomplishes water conservation, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate adaptation.
SEC. 2.
Part 2.13 (commencing with Section 10960) is added to Division 6 of the Water Code, to read:

The following requirements apply to a project that receives a grant pursuant to Section 10962:
(a) The project shall use compost and mulch from recycled organic materials that maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
(b) The project shall leverage local, state, and federal funds.
(c) The department shall give priority to projects that would aid community green spaces and urban canopies at the greatest risk from drought and climate impacts.","The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. Existing law, the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, requires the Department of Water Resources to update its model water-efficient landscape ordinance by regulation and prescribes various requirements for the updated model ordinance. Existing law requires each local agency to adopt either the updated model water-efficient landscape ordinance or an ordinance that is at least as effective in conserving water as the updated model ordinance. If the local agency does not make a selection, the model ordinance shall apply within the jurisdiction of the local agency.
This bill would require the department
, upon identification of a funding source,
to create the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program for the purpose of encouraging local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances, and support and enhance water inefficient grass replacement. This bill would create the Water Efficient Landscaping Fund and provide that moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the department for certain purposes.","An act to add Part 2.13 (commencing with Section 10960) to Division 6 of the Water Code, relating to water."
1138,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1793.2 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
1793.2.
(a) Every manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall:
(1) (A) Maintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or designate and authorize in this state as service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties.
(B) As a means of complying with this paragraph, a manufacturer may enter into warranty service contracts with independent service and repair facilities. The warranty service contracts may provide for a fixed schedule of rates to be charged for warranty service or warranty repair work. However, the rates fixed by those contracts shall be in conformity with the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 1793.3. The rates established pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1793.3, between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility, do not preclude a good faith discount that is reasonably related to reduced credit and general overhead cost factors arising from the manufacturer’s payment of warranty charges direct to the independent service and repair facility. The warranty service contracts authorized by this paragraph may not be executed to cover a period of time in excess of one year, and may be renewed only by a separate, new contract or letter of agreement between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility.
(2) In the event of a failure to comply with paragraph (1) of this subdivision, be subject to Section 1793.5.
(3) Make available to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period.
(b) Where those service and repair facilities are maintained in this state and service or repair of the goods is necessary because they do not conform with the applicable express warranties, service and repair shall be commenced within a reasonable time by the manufacturer or its representative in this state. Unless the buyer agrees in writing to the contrary, the goods shall be serviced or repaired so as to conform to the applicable warranties within 30 days. Delay caused by conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its representatives shall serve to extend this 30-day requirement. Where delay arises, conforming goods shall be tendered as soon as possible following termination of the condition giving rise to the delay.
(c) The buyer shall deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer’s service and repair facility within this state, unless, due to reasons of size and weight, or method of attachment, or method of installation, or nature of the nonconformity, delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished. If the buyer cannot return the nonconforming goods for any of these reasons, he or she shall notify the manufacturer or its nearest service and repair facility within the state. Written notice of nonconformity to the manufacturer or its service and repair facility shall constitute return of the goods for purposes of this section. Upon receipt of that notice of nonconformity, the manufacturer shall, at its option, service or repair the goods at the buyer’s residence, or pick up the goods for service and repair, or arrange for transporting the goods to its service and repair facility. All reasonable costs of transporting the goods when a buyer cannot return them for any of the above reasons shall be at the manufacturer’s expense. The reasonable costs of transporting nonconforming goods after delivery to the service and repair facility until return of the goods to the buyer shall be at the manufacturer’s expense.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
(2) If the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph (A) or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph (B). However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.
(A) In the case of replacement, the manufacturer shall replace the buyer’s vehicle with a new motor vehicle substantially identical to the vehicle replaced. The replacement vehicle shall be accompanied by all express and implied warranties that normally accompany new motor vehicles of that specific kind. The manufacturer also shall pay for, or to, the buyer the amount of any sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees which the buyer is obligated to pay in connection with the replacement, plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794, including, but not limited to,
the lesser of
reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs
and those costs
actually incurred by the buyer.
(B) In the case of restitution, the manufacturer shall make restitution in an amount equal to the actual price paid or payable by the buyer, including any charges for transportation and manufacturer-installed options, but excluding nonmanufacturer items installed by a dealer or the buyer, and including any collateral charges such as sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees, plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794, including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
(C) When the manufacturer replaces the new motor vehicle pursuant to subparagraph (A), the buyer shall only be liable to pay the manufacturer an amount directly attributable to use by the buyer of the replaced vehicle prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. When restitution is made pursuant to subparagraph (B), the amount to be paid by the manufacturer to the buyer may be reduced by the manufacturer by that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. The amount directly attributable to use by the buyer shall be determined by multiplying the actual price of the new motor vehicle paid or payable by the buyer, including any charges for transportation and manufacturer-installed options, by a fraction having as its denominator 120,000 and having as its numerator the number of miles traveled by the new motor vehicle prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. Nothing in this paragraph shall in any way limit the rights or remedies available to the buyer under any other law.
(D) Pursuant to Section 1795.4, a buyer of a new motor vehicle shall also include a lessee of a new motor vehicle.
(e) (1) If the goods cannot practicably be serviced or repaired by the manufacturer or its representative to conform to the applicable express warranties because of the method of installation or because the goods have become so affixed to real property as to become a part thereof, the manufacturer shall either replace and install the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, including installation costs, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
(2) With respect to claims arising out of deficiencies in the construction of a new residential dwelling, paragraph (1) shall not apply to either of the following:
(A) A product that is not a manufactured product, as defined in subdivision (g) of Section 896.
(B) A claim against a person or entity that is not the manufacturer that originally made the express warranty for that manufactured product.
SECTION 1.
Section 1793.22 of the
Civil Code
is amended to read:
1793.22.
(a)This section shall be known, and may be cited as, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act.
(b)It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery to the buyer or 18,000 miles on the odometer of the vehicle, whichever occurs first, one or more of the following conditions occur:
(1)The same nonconformity results in a condition that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if the vehicle is driven and the nonconformity has been subject to repair two or more times by the manufacturer or its agents, and the buyer or lessee has at least once directly notified the manufacturer of the need for the repair of the nonconformity.
(2)The same nonconformity has been subject to repair four or more times by the manufacturer or its agents and the buyer has at least once directly notified the manufacturer of the need for the repair of the nonconformity.
(3)The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair of nonconformities by the manufacturer or its agents for a cumulative total of more than 30 calendar days since delivery of the vehicle to the buyer. The 30-day limit shall be extended only if repairs cannot be performed due to conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its agents. The buyer shall be required to directly notify the manufacturer pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) only if the manufacturer has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the buyer, with the warranty or the owner’s manual, the provisions of this section and that of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2, including the requirement that the buyer must notify the manufacturer directly pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2). The notification, if required, shall be sent to the address, if any, specified clearly and conspicuously by the manufacturer in the warranty or owner’s manual. This presumption shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof, and it may be asserted by the buyer in any civil action, including an action in small claims court, or other formal or informal proceeding.
(c)If a qualified third-party dispute resolution process exists, and the buyer receives timely notification in writing of the availability of that qualified third-party dispute resolution process with a description of its operation and effect, the presumption in subdivision (b) may not be asserted by the buyer until after the buyer has initially resorted to the qualified third-party dispute resolution process as required in subdivision (d). Notification of the availability of the qualified third-party dispute resolution process is not timely if the buyer suffers any prejudice resulting from any delay in giving the notification. If a qualified third-party dispute resolution process does not exist, or if the buyer is dissatisfied with that third-party decision, or if the manufacturer or its agent neglects to promptly fulfill the terms of the qualified third-party dispute resolution process decision after the decision is accepted by the buyer, the buyer may assert the presumption provided in subdivision (b) in an action to enforce the buyer’s rights under subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2. The findings and decision of a qualified third-party dispute resolution process shall be admissible in evidence in the action without further foundation. Any period of limitation of actions under any federal or California laws with respect to any person shall be extended for a period equal to the number of days between the date a complaint is filed with a third-party dispute resolution process and the date of its decision or the date before which the manufacturer or its agent is required by the decision to fulfill its terms if the decision is accepted by the buyer, whichever occurs later.
(d)A qualified third-party dispute resolution process shall be one that does all of the following:
(1)Complies with the minimum requirements of the Federal Trade Commission for informal dispute settlement procedures as set forth in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as those regulations read on January 1, 1987.
(2)Renders decisions which are binding on the manufacturer if the buyer elects to accept the decision.
(3)Prescribes a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after the decision is accepted by the buyer, within which the manufacturer or its agent must fulfill the terms of its decisions.
(4)Provides arbitrators who are assigned to decide disputes with copies of, and instruction in, the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission’s regulations in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as those regulations read on January 1, 1987, Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code, and this chapter.
(5)Requires the manufacturer, when the process orders, under the terms of this chapter, either that the nonconforming motor vehicle be replaced if the buyer consents to this remedy or that restitution be made to the buyer, to replace the motor vehicle or make restitution in accordance with paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2.
(6)Provides, at the request of the arbitrator or a majority of the arbitration panel, for an inspection and written report on the condition of a nonconforming motor vehicle, at no cost to the buyer, by an automobile expert who is independent of the manufacturer.
(7)Takes into account, in rendering decisions, all legal and equitable factors, including, but not limited to, the written warranty, the rights and remedies conferred in regulations of the Federal Trade Commission contained in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as those regulations read on January 1, 1987, Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code, this chapter, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this chapter requires that, to be certified as a qualified third-party dispute resolution process pursuant to this section, decisions of the process must consider or provide remedies in the form of awards of punitive damages or multiple damages, under subdivision (c) of Section 1794, or of attorneys’ fees under subdivision (d) of Section 1794, or of consequential damages other than as provided in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 1794, including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
(8)Requires that no arbitrator deciding a dispute may be a party to the dispute and that no other person, including an employee, agent, or dealer for the manufacturer, may be allowed to participate substantively in the merits of any dispute with the arbitrator unless the buyer is allowed to participate also. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits any member of an arbitration board from deciding a dispute.
(9)Obtains and maintains certification by the Department of Consumer Affairs pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 472) of Division 1 of the Business and Professions Code.
(e)For the purposes of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2 and this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1)“Nonconformity” means a nonconformity which substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle to the buyer or lessee.
(2)“New motor vehicle” means a new motor vehicle that is bought or used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. “New motor vehicle” also means a new motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight under 10,000 pounds that is bought or used primarily for business purposes by a person, including a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or any other legal entity, to which not more than five motor vehicles are registered in this state. “New motor vehicle” includes the chassis, chassis cab, and that portion of a motor home devoted to its propulsion, but does not include any portion designed, used, or maintained primarily for human habitation, a dealer-owned vehicle and a “demonstrator” or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty but does not include a motorcycle or a motor vehicle which is not registered under the Vehicle Code because it is to be operated or used exclusively off the highways. A demonstrator is a vehicle assigned by a dealer for the purpose of demonstrating qualities and characteristics common to vehicles of the same or similar model and type.
(3)“Motor home” means a vehicular unit built on, or permanently attached to, a self-propelled motor vehicle chassis, chassis cab, or van, which becomes an integral part of the completed vehicle, designed for human habitation for recreational or emergency occupancy.
(f)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall sell, either at wholesale or retail, lease, or transfer a motor vehicle transferred by a buyer or lessee to a manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2 or a similar statute of any other state, unless the nature of the nonconformity experienced by the original buyer or lessee is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the prospective buyer, lessee, or transferee, the nonconformity is corrected, and the manufacturer warrants to the new buyer, lessee, or transferee in writing for a period of one year that the motor vehicle is free of that nonconformity.
(2)Except for the requirement that the nature of the nonconformity be disclosed to the transferee, paragraph (1) does not apply to the transfer of a motor vehicle to an educational institution if the purpose of the transfer is to make the motor vehicle available for use in automotive repair courses.","Existing law requires a manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty to maintain sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close where its goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or to designate and authorize independent repair or service facilities to fulfill this purpose. Existing law requires a manufacturer that is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts to replace the vehicle or promptly make restitution. Existing law requires a manufacturer, in the case of a replacement, to also pay other specified costs, including reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
This bill, in the case of a new motor vehicle replacement as described above, would require the manufacturer to pay the lesser of reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs and those costs actually incurred by the buyer.
Existing law, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act, establishes a presumption that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery or 18,000 miles on the odometer, whichever occurs first, one or more conditions occur.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","An act to amend Section

(iv) The name of the employee and only the last four digits of his or her social security number or an employee identification number other than a social security number.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, “promptly and easily determine” means a reasonable person would be able to readily ascertain the information without reference to other documents or information.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, a “knowing and intentional failure” does not include an isolated and unintentional payroll error due to a clerical or inadvertent mistake. In reviewing for compliance with this section, the factfinder may consider as a relevant factor whether the employer, prior to an alleged violation, has adopted and is in compliance with a set of policies, procedures, and practices that fully comply with this section.

Execution of an affidavit under penalty of perjury pursuant to Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 6550) of Division 11 of the Family Code by the caregiving adult is a sufficient basis for a determination that the pupil lives in the home of the caregiver, unless the school district determines from actual facts that the pupil is not living in the home of the caregiver.
(6) A pupil residing in a state hospital located within the boundaries of that school district.
(7) A pupil whose parent or legal guardian resides outside of the boundaries of that school district but is employed and lives with the pupil at the place of his or her employment within the boundaries of the school district for a minimum of three days during the school week.
(b) (1) A school district may deem a pupil to have complied with the residency requirements for school attendance in the school district if at least one parent or the legal guardian of the pupil is physically employed within the boundaries of that school district for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week.
(2) This subdivision does not require the school district within which at least one parent or the legal guardian of a pupil is employed to admit the pupil to its schools. A school district shall not, however, refuse to admit a pupil under this subdivision on the basis, except as expressly provided in this subdivision, of race, ethnicity, sex, parental income, scholastic achievement, or any other arbitrary consideration.
(3) The school district in which the residency of either the parents or the legal guardian of the pupil is established, or the school district to which the pupil is to be transferred under this subdivision, may prohibit the transfer of the pupil under this subdivision if the governing board of the school district determines that the transfer would negatively impact the court-ordered or voluntary desegregation plan of the school district.
(4) The school district to which the pupil is to be transferred under this subdivision may prohibit the transfer of the pupil if the school district determines that the additional cost of educating the pupil would exceed the amount of additional state aid received as a result of the transfer.
(5) The governing board of a school district that prohibits the transfer of a pupil pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), or (4) is encouraged to identify, and communicate in writing to the parents or the legal guardian of the pupil, the specific reasons for that determination and is encouraged to ensure that the determination, and the specific reasons for the determination, are accurately recorded in the minutes of the board meeting in which the determination was made.
(6) The average daily attendance for pupils admitted pursuant to this subdivision is calculated pursuant to Section 46607.
(7) Unless approved by the sending school district, this subdivision does not authorize a net transfer of pupils out of a school district, calculated as the difference between the number of pupils exiting the school district and the number of pupils entering the school district, in a fiscal year in excess of the following amounts:
(A) For a school district with an average daily attendance for that fiscal year of less than 501, 5 percent of the average daily attendance of the school district.
(B) For a school district with an average daily attendance for that fiscal year of 501 or more, but less than 2,501, 3 percent of the average daily attendance of the school district or 25 pupils, whichever amount is greater.
(C) For a school district with an average daily attendance of 2,501 or more, 1 percent of the average daily attendance of the school district or 75 pupils, whichever amount is greater.
(8) Once a pupil is deemed to have complied with the residency requirements for school attendance pursuant to this subdivision and is enrolled in a school in a school district the boundaries of which include the location where at least one parent or the legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed, the pupil does not have to reapply in the next school year to attend a school within that school district and the governing board of the school district shall allow the pupil to attend school through grade 12 in that school district if the parent or legal guardian so chooses and if at least one parent or the legal guardian of the pupil continues to be physically employed by an employer situated within the attendance boundaries of the school district, subject to paragraphs (2) to (7), inclusive.

Until July 1, 2017, existing law authorizes a school district within the boundaries of which at least one parent or the legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week to allow that pupil to attend a school in that school district through grade 12 if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil so chooses and if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil continues to be physically employed by an employer situated within the attendance boundaries of the school district.

Article 3 (commencing with Section 52053) is added to Chapter 6.1 of Part 28 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:
Article  3. Statewide Accountability System
52053.
(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature and purpose of this article to do all of the following:
(A) Establish a coherent, aligned local-state-federal accountability system that addresses state, local, parent, community, and public needs, as well as federal requirements.
(B) Ensure ambitious, statewide standards for performance and expectations for improvement that encourage continuous improvement and the closure of opportunity and achievement gaps.
(C) Establish a mechanism using multiple measures that meaningfully differentiates the performance of schools and identifies schools and local educational agencies in need of technical assistance, support, and intervention.
(2) It is further the intent of the Legislature that the accountability system continues to support and advance the framework established by the local control funding formula and California’s emphasis on continuous improvement, technical assistance, and support.
(b) For purposes of a statewide accountability system and to ensure alignment and fidelity with the state priorities established pursuant to Sections 52060 and 52066 and with federal law, the state board shall adopt a statewide accountability system that meets all of the following requirements:
(1) Is a single, integrated system that aligns local, state, and federal accountability requirements.
(2) Satisfies the accountability system requirements of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 6301 et seq.), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95).
(3) Aligns California’s local control framework, which is focused on identifying and supporting local educational agencies with the additional need to identify, support, and improve California’s highest need schools. In doing so, the state board shall do all of the following:
(A) Set clear, ambitious, statewide standards for performance and expectations for improvement toward each of the key indicators described in paragraph (4) for pupils overall and for each numerically significant subgroup, as identified in Section 52052. To comply with federal law, these improvement standards shall be differentiated by subgroup so that subgroups that start off at lower performance levels make greater growth to achieve the statewide standards.
(B) Establish a mechanism to meaningfully differentiate the performance of all public schools, to identify local educational agencies for purposes of Sections 52071, 52071.5, 52072, and 52072.5 on an annual basis based on outcomes for all pupils and for each subgroup of pupils using the multiple measures identified in paragraph (4), and to do all of the following:
(i) Distinguish multiple levels of performance for purposes of continuous improvement, transparency, meaningful stakeholder engagement, recognition, and support, including the identification of the following:
(I) Not less than the lowest-performing 5 percent of all schools receiving federal Title I funds and all public high schools in the state failing to graduate one-third or more of their pupils.
(II) All schools in which any subgroup of pupils is consistently underperforming, as determined by the state board, based on all of the indicators identified in paragraph (4) and the system established pursuant this section.
(III) All schools where any one subgroup of pupils, on its own, would lead that school to be in the lowest 5 percent of schools for pupils overall.
(ii) Support parents and guardians in making informed school decisions on behalf of their children.
(iii) Enable school districts, county offices of education, the department, and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to identify schools for recognition, support, and assistance and ensure that support and assistance is provided to at least those schools identified pursuant to clause (i).
(C) Comply with all notification, stakeholder engagement, school support, and improvement activities required by Section 1111(d) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95), and, to the extent required by state and federal law, ensure notifications of stakeholder engagement, school support, and improvement activities are translated in the top five languages as identified by the department.
(4) (A) Relies upon data from key indicators established pursuant to the evaluation rubrics adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 52064.5. At a minimum, for purposes of paragraph (3), those key indicators shall include, if not already included by the state board pursuant to Section 52064.5, all of the following:
(i) For elementary and middle schools:
(I) A measure of pupil achievement in at least English language arts, mathematics, and science.
(II) A measure of academic growth.

(ii) For high schools:
(I) A measure of pupil achievement in at least English language arts, mathematics, and science.

(IV) A measure of college and career readiness.
(V) A measure of chronic absenteeism.
(VI) A measure of school climate.
(B) This paragraph shall not be construed as to preclude the state board from including additional statewide measures that can be disaggregated by subgroup in the accountability system for purposes of meaningful differentiation of all schools or from grouping the measures into common clusters. Furthermore, it is the intent of the Legislature that the state will continue to use the evaluation rubrics established pursuant to Section 52064.5 and all indicators identified as state priorities established pursuant to Sections 52060 and 52066 and the subgroups identified pursuant to Section 52052 for purposes of continuous improvement and to guide the provision of technical assistance, support, and intervention.
(C) In order to comply with federal law, the academic indicators specified in subclauses (I) to (III), inclusive, of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall receive substantial weight and, in aggregate, much greater weight than is afforded to all other indicators.
(D) For purposes of paragraph (3), performance of subgroups shall receive substantial weight.
(5) Provides the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence established pursuant to Section 52074, county superintendents of schools, and the public with data to be used in a multitiered system of review and assistance. Notwithstanding the key indicators used for purposes of paragraph (3), in identifying appropriate assistance for a school or local educational agency, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and the county superintendents of schools shall analyze data aligned with all the state priorities established pursuant to Sections 52060 and 52066 in order to align the level of support, collaboration, and intervention to the needs of the local educational agency or individual school or schools.
(6) Ensures the creation of a data and reporting system that provides meaningful and accessible information on school and school district performance that is displayed through an electronic platform. Parents and the public shall have the ability to easily access, compare, analyze, and summarize school reports, pupil performance results, and the progress made by schools and school districts in reaching all of the state’s priority areas for purposes of local control and accountability plans and the local control funding formula. It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that any Web-based data and analysis tools should enable all stakeholders to readily identify strengths and weaknesses, identify inequities between schools and subgroups of pupils across multiple measures, monitor academic achievement and improvement, provide for meaningful differentiation, as required by Section 1111(c)(4)(C) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95), and enable users to download data and reports in machine-readable formats. It is further the intent of the Legislature to ensure that, to the extent required by state and federal law, the information on school, school district, and subgroup performance be made available in the top five languages as identified by the department.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law required, on or before July 1, 2014, the governing boards of school districts and county boards of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a state template adopted by the State Board of Education. Existing law requires the local control and accountability plan to include, among other things, a description of annual goals for all pupils and specified subgroups of pupils to be achieved for each state priority, as specified, and a description of the specific actions the school district or county superintendent of schools will take to achieve those goals. Existing law requires the charter petition for a charter school to include those same elements. Existing law provides that an adopted local control and accountability plan is effective for 3 years and shall be updated annually on or before July 1. Existing law requires the state board, on or before October 1, 2016, to adopt evaluation rubrics to, among other things, assist a school district, county office of education, or charter school in evaluating its strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement. Existing law establishes the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence for purposes of advising and assisting school districts, county superintendents of schools, and charter schools in achieving the goals set forth in a local control and accountability plan.
This bill would, for purposes of a statewide accountability system and to ensure alignment and fidelity with the state priorities and federal law, require the state board to adopt a statewide accountability system that, among other things, is a single integrated system that aligns local, state, and federal accountability requirements. In identifying appropriate assistance for a school or local educational agency, the bill would require the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and county superintendents of schools to analyze data aligned with all the state priorities in order to align the level of support, collaboration, and intervention to the needs of the local educational agency or individual school or schools. By imposing additional duties on county superintendents of schools, and to the extent this bill would impose additional duties on local educational agency officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 52053) to Chapter 6.1 of Part 28 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, relating to school accountability."

No appropriation pursuant to Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be made for purposes of implementing this act.","Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients.
Existing law establishes the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-FC) program, under which counties provide payments to foster care providers on behalf of qualified children in foster care. Under existing law, a child who is placed in the approved home of a relative is eligible for AFDC-FC if he or she is eligible for federal financial participation in the AFDC-FC payment, as specified. Existing law provides for benefits for a child who is placed in the approved home of a relative and who is ineligible for AFDC-FC pursuant to the CalWORKs program. Existing law establishes the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program in counties choosing to participate, for the purpose of making the amount paid to relative caregivers for the in-home care of children placed with them who are ineligible for AFDC-FC payments equal to the amount paid on behalf of children who are eligible for AFDC-FC payments.
This bill would

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to encourage the development of photovoltaic and wind generation facilities to meet the state’s renewable portfolio standard and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.","Existing law requires a city or county that determines that a project, as defined, is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act to identify any public water system that may supply water for the project and to request those public water systems to prepare a specified water supply assessment. If no public water system is identified, the city or county is required to prepare the water supply assessment.
Existing law defines “project” for purposes of these provisions as, among other things, a project that would demand an amount of water equivalent to, or greater than, the amount of water required by a 500 dwelling unit project. For a public water system that has fewer than 5,000 service connections, existing law defines “project” as development that would account for a specified increase in the number of service connections. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, exempts from the definition of “project” a proposed photovoltaic or wind energy generation facility that would demand no more than 75 acre-feet of water annually.
This bill would, until January 1, 2018, exempt the above-described proposed photovoltaic or wind energy generation facilities from the definition of “project.” The bill would thereby extend the duties on local agencies with respect to determining whether a project is subject to the water supply assessment requirements, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend and repeal Section 10912 of the Water Code, relating to water supply, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Corinthian Colleges, Inc., was the target of consumer and taxpayer protection enforcement efforts by the federal government, the Attorney General, and other state and federal authorities.
(b) Based on findings of harm to students enrolled at Corinthian Colleges campuses, the United States Department of Education announced debt relief programs to assist students, including all of the following:
(1) A student who attended a Corinthian Colleges campus that closed on April 27, 2015, and withdrew any time after June 20, 2014, is eligible to apply for a closed school loan discharge, so long as the student does not transfer earned credit and subsequently
complete
completes
a comparable program at another institution.
(2) A student who believes he or she was a victim of fraud or other violations of state law by Corinthian Colleges can apply for debt relief under borrower defense to repayment. The United States Department of Education has determined that Corinthian Colleges misrepresented job placement rates for a majority of programs at its Heald College campuses between 2010 and 2014, and California Everest College and WyoTech campuses between 2010 and 2013, and is in the process of establishing a specific process for federal loan discharge for these students.
(3) A Corinthian Colleges student who intends to submit a borrower defense claim may request loan forbearance while a claims review process is established and his or her claim is reviewed.
(c) On March 25, 2016, the United States Department of Education announced the approval of 6,838 of the 11,740 closed school loan discharge claims and approval of 2,048 of the approximately 11,000 borrower defense to repayment loan forgiveness claims received. Rough estimates place the number of students with eligibility to file a closed school loan discharge or defense to repayment claim at over 350,000 students.
(d) According to testimony provided at the November 10, 2015, advisory committee meeting, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education staff indicated that Corinthian Colleges students have largely needed assistance in working with loan servicers to secure a closed school loan discharge and in applying to the United States Department of Education for loan forgiveness based on borrower defense to repayment. According to that testimony, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at that time had one employee responsible for assisting the hundreds of thousands of California students eligible for loan forgiveness and tuition recovery.
(e) Without assistance, evidence shows that only a small fraction of students eligible for tuition recovery or federal loan discharge will file a claim.
(f) Pursuant to Section 94923, the Student Tuition Recovery Fund exists to relieve or mitigate a student’s economic loss caused by a documented violation of certain laws or by institutional closure, as specified.
(g) It is consistent with the purpose of the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to provide assistance to Corinthian Colleges students to obtain federal and private loan discharge and other financial aid relief.
(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that unencumbered restitution funds awarded to the state from a lawsuit involving Corinthian Colleges and its affiliate institutions, including Heald College, be used to repay any funds provided to students pursuant to this act.

(a) Upon appropriation by the Legislature from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, in response to the student harm caused by the practices and unlawful closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., grant funds shall be timely provided in accordance with this section to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist the eligible students of that closed institution by relieving or mitigating the economic and educational opportunity loss incurred by those students.
(b) (1)   The terms and conditions of the grant agreements shall ensure that grant funds are used for the exclusive purpose of assisting eligible students with federal and private loan discharge and other financial aid relief, and that students eligible to claim recovery through the Student Tuition Recovery Fund are referred to the bureau for assistance with claim processing.
(2) This subdivision is not intended to prohibit a nonprofit community service organization from using grant funds to screen student requests for assistance in order to determine if a student meets assistance eligibility requirements.
(c) Services provided by eligible nonprofit community service organizations may include, but are not to be limited to, outreach and education, screening requests for assistance, referring students for additional legal assistance through pro bono referral programs, and legal services.

(f) (1)   The bureau shall notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges closures within 15 days of the effective date of this section.
(2) The notification shall include the name and location of the school, the programs, and the number of students affected at each site of the school, as appropriate.

Any unused funds shall be returned to the Attorney General for return to the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, except that, upon the approval of the Attorney General, an eligible nonprofit community service organization may expend those unused funds to provide assistance to students who were enrolled at an institution approved to operate by the bureau and who were harmed by the unlawful closure of that institution. The Attorney General, or a contracted qualified entity, may terminate the grant agreement for material breach, and may require repayment of funds provided to the nonprofit community service organization during the time that the agreement was being materially breached. However, the Attorney General, or a qualified entity, shall provide the grantee with written notice of the breach and a reasonable opportunity of not less than 30 days to resolve the breach.

(k) The adoption of any regulation pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be an emergency and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety, or general welfare.
SEC. 6.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that grant funds be made available from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to assist former students of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., in obtaining federal and private loan discharge and other financial aid related relief, that the amount of funds available be calculated by multiplying the number of students (13,000) enrolled at the time of the institution’s unlawful closure by one hundred dollars ($100), and that organizations receiving grants use available funds in ways that maximize the number of California students that apply for and receive loan discharge and tuition recovery.
(b) Consistent with subdivision (a), the sum of one million three hundred thousand dollars ($1,300,000) is hereby appropriated from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for the purposes of providing grants pursuant to Section 94926.5 of the Education Code, and to pay an amount not to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) for the reasonable administrative costs of the Attorney General’s office related to these grants.
SEC. 7.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to provide immediate educational and economic relief to the thousands of students harmed by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.","(1) The California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 provides for the regulation of private postsecondary educational institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education in the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act also establishes the Student Tuition Recovery Fund and requires the bureau to adopt regulations governing the administration and maintenance of the fund, including requirements relating to assessments on students and student claims against the fund, and establishes that the moneys in this fund are continuously appropriated to the bureau for specified purposes.
This bill would appropriate the sum of $1,300,000 from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for the purposes of providing grants to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist eligible students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., as defined, with loan discharge and other student loan-related requests and tuition recovery-related claims, and to pay an amount not to exceed $150,000 for the reasonable administrative costs of the Attorney General’s office related to these grants, as specified. The bill would require the bureau to notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges closures within 15 days of the effective date of these provisions. The bill would require the Attorney General to, among other things, within 90 days of the notification, solicit grant applications from eligible nonprofit community service organizations, select one or more of these organizations deemed to be qualified, and set additional terms and conditions of the grants as necessary. The bill would provide that any unused funds are to be returned to the Attorney General for return to the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, except that, upon the approval of the Attorney General, an eligible nonprofit community service organization may expend those unused funds to provide assistance to students who were enrolled at an institution approved to operate by the bureau and who were harmed by the unlawful closure of that institution. The bill would set a schedule for how grant funds are to be distributed. The bill would require the grantee to submit specified information to the Attorney General on a quarterly basis, and require the Attorney General to make these reports available to the Legislature and the bureau upon request. The bill would require the Attorney General to provide the Legislature and the bureau a final report summarizing all the information submitted to it by grantees, promptly following the time when all funds are expended by the grantees, or by January 1, 2019, whichever is earlier. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to contract with another qualified entity to perform the Attorney General’s duties under these provisions.
(2) This bill would, until July 1, 2020, authorize state agencies that provide licensure to consider for licensure students who were enrolled in an educational program of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., designed to lead to licensure from that state agency, and who did not receive that licensure due to the institution’s closure.
(3) The Cal Grant Program prohibits an applicant from receiving Cal Grant awards totaling in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of 4 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on Cal Grant awards a student who was enrolled and received a Cal Grant award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(4) The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program authorizes the renewal of California National Guard Education Assistance Awards, for a maximum of the greater of either 4 years of full-time equivalent enrollment or the duration for which the qualifying member would otherwise be eligible pursuant to the Cal Grant Program, if specified conditions are met.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on California National Guard Education Assistance Awards a student who was enrolled and received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(5) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add Sections 69433.61, 69999.19, 94051, and 94926.5 to the Education Code, relating to higher education, making an appropriation therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

Notwithstanding the existence of a conservatorship pursuant to the provisions of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code), the prosecuting attorney shall prove, as an element of the crime, that a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability rendered the alleged victim incapable of giving consent.
(2) Where it is accomplished against a person’s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.
(3) Where a person is
prevented from resisting

As used in this paragraph, “public official” means a person employed by a governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position, to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not actually have to be a public official.

For any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women’s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under this subdivision, the court shall make a determination of the defendant’s ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women’s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property may not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.

(C)A representative of a group or organization authorized pursuant to its articles of incorporation or bylaws to represent the interests of residential customers, or to represent small commercial customers who receive bundled electric service from an electrical corporation.
(2)“Customer” does not include any state, federal, or local government agency, any publicly owned public utility, or any entity that, in the commission’s opinion, was established or formed by a local government entity for the purpose of participating in a commission proceeding.
(c)“Expert witness fees” means recorded or billed costs incurred by a customer for an expert witness.
(d)“Other reasonable costs” means reasonable out-of-pocket expenses directly incurred by a customer that are directly related to the contentions or recommendations made by the customer that resulted in a substantial contribution.
(e)“Party” means any interested party, respondent public utility, or commission staff in a hearing or proceeding.

The commission may establish rules to modify or change the definition of “small commercial customer,” including use of criteria other than a peak demand threshold, if the commission determines that the modification or change will promote participation in proceedings at the commission by organizations representing small businesses, without incorporating large commercial and industrial customers.
(i)“Substantial contribution” means that, in the judgment of the commission, the customer’s presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions, legal contentions, or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer. Where the customer’s participation has resulted in a substantial contribution, even if the decision adopts that customer’s contention or recommendations only in part, the commission may award the customer compensation for all reasonable advocate’s fees, reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation.

The commission shall deny any claim for compensation for contributions to a closed proceeding unless otherwise specified in this article.","Charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies, are subject to the jurisdiction and control of the Public Utilities Commission under the Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act.
This bill would require the commission to establish a telephone communications service, with a designated telephone number, that would be available to members of the public to communicate to the commission any concerns, or register complaints, regarding service provided by charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies. The bill would require each charter-party carrier of passengers to include the telephone number designated by the commission on all contracts for service made after January 1, 2018, and for a transportation network company or other charter-party carrier of passengers that arranges for transportation utilizing application software, commonly termed an app, the bill would require that the customer be notified of the existence of, andf the Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act or an order or direction of the commission pursuant to the act is a crime.
Because the provisions of this bill are within the act and require action by the commission to implement its requirements, a violation of these provisions would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has broad regulatory authority pursuant to the California Constitution and the Public Utilities Act over public utilities, as defined, including common carriers, toll bridge corporations, electrical corporations, gas corporations, pipeline corporations, telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, water corporations, sewer system corporations, and heat corporations. In addition, the commission has more limited authority over certain other corporations, including charter-party carriers of passengers. Existing law provides compensation for reasonable advocate’s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs to public utility customers and representatives of customers for participation or intervention in formal proceedings of the commission involving electrical, gas, water, telegraph, and telephone public utilities.
This bill would additionally authorize compensation to be awarded by the commission for reasonable advocate’s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs to customers and representatives of customers for participation or intervention in formal proceedings of the commission involving a corporation that is subject to regulation by the commission pursuant to the Passenger Charter-Party Carriers’ Act.

(d) As used in this section, an energy project is any project designed to produce, convert, or transmit energy as one of its primary functions.","Previously existing law established the Office of Permit Assistance within the Trade and Commerce Agency to, among other things, provide information to developers relating to the permit approval process. Under existing law, a state agency which is the lead agency for a development project is required to inform the applicant for a permit that the Office of Permit Assistance has been created for this purpose.
This bill would instead require a state agency that is a lead agency for a development project to inform the applicant for a permit that the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development has been created for this purpose. The bill would also delete various obsolete provisions relating to the Office of Permit Assistance.
Existing law establishes procedures for a land use decision by a local agency concerning a specified hazardous waste facility project, as defined.

Existing law requires the Director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development to ensure that the office’s Internet Web site contains information to assist an individual with the licensing, permitting, and registration requirements necessary to start a business, including fee requirements and fee schedules of state agencies.
This bill would establish the Permit Assistance Program within the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development. The bill would require the program to, among other things, provide permitting and regulatory compliance assistance to businesses and provide mediation and 3rd-party neutral facilitation to resolve conflicts between applicants and permitting and regulatory entities. The bill would require the program to manage and regularly update the tools provided on the office’s Internet Web site. The bill would require the office to report annually on the activities and outcomes of the program.","An act to amend Sections 65460.5 and 65923.8 of, to amend and renumber Section 12019.5 of, to add Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 12097) to Chapter 1.6 of Part 2 of Division 3 of Title 2 to, and to repeal Section 66033 of, the Government Code, to amend Section 25199.7 of, and to repeal Section 25199.4 of, the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 25616 of the Public Resources Code, relating to state government."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) K–12 students are particularly vulnerable to solicitations for educational leadership conferences or forums that may appear to be selective awards or competitive honors, but are in fact sophisticated solicitations from for-profit companies.
(b) While such conferences and forums may have merit as learning experiences for students, it is nevertheless important to ensure that students, parents, and teachers are not misled by these solicitations. The State of California has previously enacted laws regulating educational travel organizations in order to protect students engaged in educational travel.
(c) Because it is of the utmost importance that the State of California take action to protect students from false or misleading advertising, promote high-quality educational travel experiences, encourage public confidence in leadership conferences, and assist organizations soliciting participation in these conferences in complying with safe and reputable practices, it is the intent of the Legislature to establish appropriate marketing restrictions and disclosure requirements on these solicitations.
(d) The Legislature recognizes the contributions that many nonprofit service organizations have made in the area of youth leadership training, such as the Boys and Girls State programs organized by the American Legion and the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards and Interact programs operated by the Rotary Club. These programs have demonstrated a strong commitment to youth education and civic awareness in diverse communities across the nation for decades, often at little or no cost to the participants.

(2) “Educational conference organization” or “organization” means a person, partnership, corporation, or other entity that operates in a for-profit manner and that plans and advertises educational conferences to students residing in the State of California.
(3) “Student” means a person who is enrolled in elementary or secondary school, grade kindergarten through grade 12, at the time an educational conference is arranged with an educational conference organization.
(b) An educational conference organization that provides materials related to an educational conference directly to a school or any employee thereof for purposes of distribution to a student shall comply with all of the following:
(1) The organization shall provide the materials in a sealed envelope or other packaging addressed to the parent or legal guardian of the student.
(2) The organization shall include with the materials all of the following disclosures, in clear and conspicuous language:

SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits various specified advertising practices, including, among others, the placement by an educational travel organization, as defined, or use of any misleading or untruthful advertising or statements or making of a substantial misrepresentation in conducting an educational travel program. Under existing law, the violation of any of these prohibitions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would require an educational conference organization, as defined, that provides materials related to an educational conference, as defined, directly to a school or school employee for purposes of distribution to a student to include specified disclosures with the materials, to provide those disclosures to the school and specified school employees, and to provide the materials in a sealed envelope or other packaging addressed to the parent or legal guardian of the student.

SECTION 1.
Section 53328.1 of the Government Code is amended to read:
53328.1.
(a) As an alternate and independent procedure for forming a community facilities district, the legislative body may form a community facilities district that initially consists solely of territory proposed for annexation to the community facilities district in the future, with the condition that a parcel or parcels within that territory may be annexed to the community facilities district and subjected to the special tax only with the unanimous approval of the owner or owners of the parcel or parcels at the time that the parcel or parcels are annexed. In that case, the legislative body shall follow the procedures set forth in this article for the formation of a community facilities district, with the following exceptions:
(1) The legislative body shall not be obligated to specify the rate or rates of special tax in the resolution of intention or the resolution of formation, provided that both of the following are met:
(A) The resolution of intention and the resolution of formation include a statement that the rate shall be established in an amount required to finance or refinance the authorized improvements and to pay the district’s administrative expenses.
(B) The maximum rate of special tax applicable to a parcel or parcels shall be specified in the unanimous approval described in this section relating to the parcel or parcels.
(2) The legislative body shall not be obligated to specify in the resolution of intention the conditions under which the obligation to pay the specified special tax may be prepaid and permanently satisfied. Instead, a prepayment provision may be included in the unanimous approval of the owner or owners of each parcel or parcels at the time that the parcel or parcels are annexed to the community facilities district.
(3) In lieu of approval pursuant to an election held in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 53326, 53327, 53327.5, and 53328, the appropriations limit for the community facilities district, the applicable rate of the special tax and the method of apportionment and manner of collection of that tax, and the authorization to incur bonded indebtedness for the community facilities district shall be specified and be approved by the unanimous approval of the owner or owners of each parcel or parcels at the time that the parcel or parcels are annexed to the community facilities district. No additional hearings or procedures are required, and the unanimous approval shall be deemed to constitute a unanimous vote in favor of the appropriations limit for the community facilities district, the authorization to levy the special tax on the parcel or parcels, and the authorization to incur bonded indebtedness for the community facilities district.
(4) Notwithstanding Section 53324, this paragraph establishes the applicable protest provisions in the event a local agency forms a community facilities district pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. If 50 percent or more of the registered voters, or six registered voters, whichever is more, residing within the territory proposed to be annexed to the community facilities district in the future, or if the owners of one-half or more of the area of land proposed to be annexed in the future and not exempt from the special tax, file written protests against establishment of the community facilities district, and protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the protests to less than a majority, no further proceedings to form the community facilities district shall be undertaken for a period of one year from the date of decision of the legislative body on the issues discussed at the hearing. If the majority protests of the registered voters or of the landowners are only against the furnishing of a specified type or types of facilities or services within the district, or against levying a specified special tax, those types of facilities or services or the specified special tax shall be eliminated from the resolution of formation.
(5) The legislative body shall not record a notice of special tax lien against any parcel or parcels in the community facilities district until the owner or owners of the parcel or parcels have given their unanimous approval of the parcel’s or parcels’ annexation to the community facilities district, at which time the notice of special tax lien shall be recorded against the parcel or parcels as set forth in Section 53328.3.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 53340, after adoption of the resolution of formation for a community facilities district described in subdivision (a), the legislative body may, by ordinance, provide for the levy of the special taxes on parcels that will annex to the community facilities district at the rate or rates to be approved unanimously by the owner or owners of each parcel or parcels to be annexed to the community facilities district and for apportionment and collection of the special taxes in the manner specified in the resolution of formation. No further ordinance shall be required even though no parcels may then have annexed to the community facilities district.
(c) The local agency may bring an action to determine the validity of any special taxes levied pursuant to this chapter and authorized pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 860) of Title 10 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Any appeal from a judgment in any action or proceeding described in this subdivision shall be commenced within 30 days after entry of judgment.
(d) A community facilities district formed pursuant to this section may only finance facilities pursuant to subdivision (i) or (l) of Section 53313.5.
(e) In connection with formation of a community facilities district and annexation of a parcel or parcels to the community facilities district pursuant to this section, and the conduct of an election on the proposition to authorize bonded indebtedness pursuant to the alternate procedures set forth in Section 53355.5, the local agency may, without additional hearings or procedures, designate a parcel or parcels as an improvement area within the community facilities district. After the designation of a parcel or parcels as an improvement area, all proceedings for approval of the appropriations limit, the rate and method of apportionment and manner of collection of special tax and the authorization to incur bonded indebtedness for the parcel or parcels shall apply only to the improvement area.
(f) In connection with a community facilities district formed under this section, as an alternate and independent procedure for making the changes described in Section 53330.7, the changes may be made with the unanimous approval of the owner or owners of the parcel or parcels that will be affected by the change and with the written consent of the local agency. No additional hearings or procedures are required, and the unanimous approval shall be deemed to constitute a unanimous vote in favor of the proposed changes. If the proceeds of a special tax are being used to retire any debt incurred pursuant to this chapter and the unanimous approval relates to the reduction of the special tax rate, the unanimous approval shall recite that the reduction or termination of the special tax will not interfere with the timely retirement of that debt.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the courts are currently paid under a dual compensation structure in which the base salary of the court reporter is supplemented by income from preparing required transcripts and providing other required transcription services.
(b) The dual compensation structure protects the state from bearing the full cost of transcript preparation and other transcription services and avoids the resulting consequences of overtime liability related to these services.
(c) The fees for original transcripts prepared by official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore have not been adjusted in 26 years, and fees for copies purchased at the same time as the original transcript have only increased once in 103 years.
(d) In order to ensure full and fair compensation of official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the court, and in order to attract and retain official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the courts that have sufficient skills and competence to serve the needs of the justice system, it is imperative that the system of dual compensation provide sufficient payment for transcription services.

(b) The Energy Commission, the commission, and the Independent System Operator, when undertaking activities as part of the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative, shall take into account the May 2016 Solar Convening Report and the Garamendi Principles.
SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the San Joaquin Valley Clean Energy and Jobs Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) established a policy to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020 and to continue reductions of emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2020.
(b)The Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 (Chapter 547 of the Statutes of 2015) established further clean energy policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and expand generation from eligible renewable energy resources to at least 50 percent of total retail sales of electricity in California by December 31, 2030.
(c)The San Joaquin Valley remains mired in chronic double digit unemployment, unprecedented rates of poverty, a severe ongoing drought, and poor air quality.
(d)California’s energy sector is undergoing significant advancement and transformation driven by evolving regulation, expanding renewable energy goals, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts.
(e)While rich in natural resources and clean energy opportunities, the San Joaquin Valley has largely been left behind in California’s clean energy revolution. The overwhelming majority of the state’s new transmission assets have been sited in other regions, particularly southern California, and renewable energy resource project investment, jobs, and economic and environmental benefits have followed grid access.
(f)Unlocking the renewable energy potential of the San Joaquin Valley by providing more equitable investment in a clean energy economy should be a key priority of California policymakers.
(g)Timely investment and improved transmission access are critical to the San Joaquin Valley and will allow the region to more effectively and efficiently develop clean energy opportunities at all solar project locations, create jobs, and derive cobenefits for disadvantaged communities.
(h)The Governor’s office has completed the San Joaquin Valley Solar Convening identifying high potential solar energy developments in the San Joaquin Valley that maximize renewable energy benefits and minimize environmental biological and habitat impacts.
(i)The report issued by the University of California in May 2016 on the outcome of the convening, entitled “A Path Forward: Identifying Least-Conflict Solar PV Development in California’s San Joaquin Valley,” identified 470,000 acres of least-conflict land, amounting to roughly 5 percent of the 9.5 million acres in the stakeholder study area.
(j)In order to identify least-conflict lands, the project team convened four stakeholder groups early in the process: (1) an environmental conservation group, (2) an agricultural farmland conservation group, (3) a solar industry group, and (4) a transmission group. An agricultural rangeland stakeholder group was later added to gain a better understanding of regional land value from this stakeholder perspective.
(k)The project team generated the final result, the composite least-conflict area, using the information developed with the solar industry, environmental conservation, and agricultural farmland conservation stakeholder groups.
(l)Given the proximity to existing transmission corridors, solar projects in the San Joaquin Valley can be developed in a way that minimizes the need for new transmission by prioritizing the use of existing transmission corridors consistent with the principles of transmission corridor planning developed by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission in response to Senate Bill 2431 (Chapter 1457 of the Statutes of 1988), known as the Garamendi Principles.
(m)As future clean energy investments are planned and implemented, state officials must ensure an appropriate share is targeted to improve environmental quality, expand economic development, contribute to environmental solutions, and create jobs in the San Joaquin Valley.

(1)The economically viable and environmentally beneficial reuse of drainage-impaired agricultural lands.
(2)The retirement of drainage-impaired agricultural land and facilitation of regional agricultural drainage solutions.
(3)The facilitation of surface water supply redirection from drainage-impaired agricultural lands to other productive agricultural land.
(b)Using the results of the evaluation, on or before January 31, 2017, the commission and the Energy Commission shall recommend to the Independent System Operator an amount of electricity to be generated from eligible renewable energy resources in the San Joaquin Valley that reasonably maximizes the amount of electricity to be generated from eligible renewable energy resources, consistent with the state’s overall need for electricity and the requirements of this article, and that accomplishes all of the following:
(1)Takes into account the 470,000 acres identified in the Governor’s May 2016 Solar Convening Report, entitled “A Path Forward: Identifying Least-Conflict Solar PV Development in California’s San Joaquin Valley,” along with all other lands in the Central Valley that have entitlements for solar development.
(2)Provides eligible renewable energy resources within the San Joaquin Valley with full capacity deliverability status.
(3)Minimizes the need for new transmission by prioritizing the use of existing transmission corridors consistent with the principles of transmission corridor planning developed by the Energy Commission in response to Senate Bill 2431 (Chapter 1457 of the Statutes of 1988), known as the Garamendi Principles.
(c)Using the results of the evaluation, on or before January 31, 2017, the commission and the Energy Commission shall recommend to the Independent System Operator any network transmission upgrades needed to fulfill the recommendations made pursuant to subdivision (b). This recommendation shall seek to minimize the need for new transmission by prioritizing the use of existing transmission corridors consistent with the Garamendi Principles of transmission corridor planning.","Existing law relative to electrical restructuring, within the Public Utilities Act, establishes the Independent System Operator to ensure the efficient use and reliable operation of the electric transmission grid.

(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid under this chapter, aid shall be paid to a pregnant woman for the month in which the birth is anticipated and for the six-month period immediately prior to the month in which the birth is anticipated, in the amount that would otherwise be paid to one person, as specified in subdivision (a), if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. Verification of pregnancy shall be required as a condition of eligibility for aid under this subdivision.
(3) Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Cal-Learn Program is operative.
(c) The amount of forty-seven dollars ($47) per month shall be paid to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) or (b) to meet special needs resulting from pregnancy if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. County welfare departments shall refer all recipients of aid under this subdivision to a local provider of the Women, Infants, and Children program. If that payment to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) is considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, payments under this subdivision shall not apply to persons eligible under subdivision (a), except for the month in which birth is anticipated and for the three-month period immediately prior to the month in which delivery is anticipated, if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter.
(d) For children receiving AFDC-FC under this chapter, there shall be paid, exclusive of any amount considered exempt as income, an amount of aid each month that, when added to the child’s income, is equal to the rate specified in Section 11460, 11461, 11462, 11462.1, or 11463. In addition, the child shall be eligible for special needs, as specified in departmental regulations.
(e) In addition to the amounts payable under subdivision (a) and Section 11453.1, a family shall be entitled to receive an allowance for recurring special needs not common to a majority of recipients. These recurring special needs shall include, but not be limited to, special diets upon the recommendation of a physician for circumstances other than pregnancy, and unusual costs of transportation, laundry, housekeeping services, telephone, and utilities. The recurring special needs allowance for each family per month shall not exceed that amount resulting from multiplying the sum of ten dollars ($10) by the number of recipients in the family who are eligible for assistance.
(f) After a family has used all available liquid resources, both exempt and nonexempt, in excess of one hundred dollars ($100), with the exception of funds deposited in a restricted account described in subdivision (a) of Section 11155.2, the family shall also be entitled to receive an allowance for special needs.
(1) An allowance for special needs shall be granted for replacement of clothing and household equipment and for emergency housing needs other than those needs addressed by paragraph (2). These needs shall be caused by sudden and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the needy family. The department shall establish the allowance for each of the special needs items. The sum of all special needs provided by this subdivision shall not exceed six hundred dollars ($600) per event.
(2) (A) Homeless assistance is available to a homeless family seeking shelter when the family is eligible for aid under this chapter. Homeless assistance for temporary shelter is also available to homeless families that are apparently eligible for aid under this chapter. Apparent eligibility exists when evidence presented by the applicant, or that is otherwise available to the county welfare department, and the information provided on the application documents indicate that there would be eligibility for aid under this chapter if the evidence and information were verified. However, an alien applicant who does not provide verification of his or her eligible alien status, or a woman with no eligible children who does not provide medical verification of pregnancy, is not apparently eligible for purposes of this section.
(B) A family is considered homeless, for the purpose of this section, when the family lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence; or the family has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations; or the family is residing in a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A family is also considered homeless for the purpose of this section if the family has received a notice to pay rent or quit. The family shall demonstrate that the eviction is the result of a verified financial hardship as a result of extraordinary circumstances beyond their control, and not other lease or rental violations, and that the family is experiencing a financial crisis that could result in homelessness if preventative assistance is not provided.
(3) (A) (i)
A
Once per calendar year, a
special needs benefit of sixty-five dollars ($65) a day shall be available to families of up to four members for the costs of temporary shelter, subject to the requirements of this paragraph. The fifth and additional members of the family shall each receive fifteen dollars ($15) per day, up to a daily maximum of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125). County welfare departments may increase the daily amount available for temporary shelter as necessary to secure the additional bedspace needed by the family.
(ii) This special needs benefit shall be granted or denied immediately upon the family’s application for homeless assistance, and benefits shall be available for up to three working days. The county welfare department shall verify the family’s homelessness within the first three working days and if the family meets the criteria of questionable homelessness established by the department, the county welfare department shall refer the family to its early fraud prevention and detection unit, if the county has such a unit, for assistance in the verification of homelessness within this period.
(iii) After homelessness has been verified, the three-day limit shall be extended for a period of time which, when added to the initial benefits provided, does not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. This extension of benefits shall be done in increments of one week and shall be based upon searching for permanent housing
which
that
shall be documented on a housing search form, good cause, or other circumstances defined by the department. Documentation of a housing search shall be required for the initial extension of benefits beyond the three-day limit and on a weekly basis thereafter as long as the family is receiving temporary shelter benefits. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, situations in which the county welfare department has determined that the family, to the extent it is capable, has made a good faith but unsuccessful effort to secure permanent housing while receiving temporary shelter benefits.
(B) (i) A special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is available to pay for last month’s rent and security deposits when these payments are reasonable conditions of securing a residence, or to pay for up to two months of rent arrearages, when these payments are a reasonable condition of preventing eviction.
(ii) The last month’s rent or monthly arrearage portion of the payment (I) shall not exceed 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size and (II) shall only be made to families that have found permanent housing costing no more than 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size.
(iii) However, if the county welfare department determines that a family intends to reside with individuals who will be sharing housing costs, the county welfare department shall, in appropriate circumstances, set aside the condition specified in subclause (II) of clause (ii).
(C) The special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is also available to cover the standard costs of deposits for utilities
which
that
are necessary for the health and safety of the family.
(D) A payment for or denial of permanent housing assistance shall be issued no later than one working day from the time that a family presents evidence of the availability of permanent housing. If an applicant family provides evidence of the availability of permanent housing before the county welfare department has established eligibility for aid under this chapter, the county welfare department shall complete the eligibility determination so that the denial of or payment for permanent housing assistance is issued within one working day from the submission of evidence of the availability of permanent housing, unless the family has failed to provide all of the verification necessary to establish eligibility for aid under this chapter.
(E) (i) A family that becomes homeless as a direct and primary result of a state or federally declared natural disaster shall be eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance.
(ii) A family shall be eligible for temporary and permanent housing assistance when homelessness is a direct result of domestic violence by a spouse, partner, or roommate; physical or mental illness that is medically verified that shall not include a diagnosis of alcoholism, drug addiction, or psychological stress; or, the uninhabitability of the former residence caused by sudden and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the family including natural catastrophe, fire, or condemnation. These circumstances shall be verified by a third-party governmental or private health and human services agency, except that domestic violence may also be verified by a sworn statement by the victim, as provided under Section 11495.25. The county welfare department shall immediately inform recipients who verify domestic violence by a sworn statement of the availability of domestic violence counseling and services, and refer those recipients to services upon request.
(iii) If a recipient seeking homeless assistance based on domestic violence pursuant to clause (ii) has previously received homeless avoidance services based on domestic violence, the county shall review whether services were offered to the recipient and consider what additional services would assist the recipient in leaving the domestic violence situation.
(iv) The county welfare department shall report necessary data to the department through a statewide homeless assistance payment indicator system, as requested by the department, regarding all recipients of aid under this paragraph.
(F) The county welfare departments, and all other entities participating in the costs of the CalWORKs program, have the right in their share to any refunds resulting from payment of the permanent housing. However, if an emergency requires the family to move within the 12-month period specified in subparagraph (E), the family shall be allowed to use any refunds received from its deposits to meet the costs of moving to another residence.
(G) Payments to providers for temporary shelter and permanent housing and utilities shall be made on behalf of families requesting these payments.
(H) The daily amount for the temporary shelter special needs benefit for homeless assistance may be increased if authorized by the current year’s Budget Act by specifying a different daily allowance and appropriating the funds therefor.
(I) No payment shall be made pursuant to this paragraph unless the provider of housing is a commercial establishment, shelter, or person in the business of renting properties who has a history of renting properties.
(g) The department shall establish rules and regulations ensuring the uniform statewide application of this section.
(h) The department shall notify all applicants and recipients of aid through the standardized application form that these benefits are available and shall provide an opportunity for recipients to apply for the funds quickly and efficiently.
(i) (1) Except for the purposes of Section 15200, the amounts payable to recipients pursuant to Section 11453.1 shall not constitute part of the payment schedule set forth in subdivision (a).
(2) The amounts payable to recipients pursuant to Section 11453.1 shall not constitute income to recipients of aid under this section.
(j) For children receiving Kin-GAP pursuant to Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) or Article 4.7 (commencing with Section 11385) there shall be paid, exclusive of any amount considered exempt as income, an amount of aid each month, which, when added to the child’s income, is equal to the rate specified in Sections 11364 and 11387.
(k) (1) A county shall implement the semiannual reporting requirements in accordance with Chapter 501 of the Statutes of 2011 no later than October 1, 2013.
(2) Upon completion of the implementation described in paragraph (1), each county shall provide a certificate to the director certifying that semiannual reporting has been implemented in the county.
(3) Upon filing the certificate described in paragraph (2), a county shall comply with the semiannual reporting provisions of this section.
(l) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2015.
SEC. 2.
No appropriation pursuant to Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be made for purposes of this act.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which, through a combination of federal, state, and county funds, each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families. As part of the CalWORKs program, a homeless family that has used all available liquid resources in excess of $100 may be eligible for homeless assistance benefits to pay the costs of temporary shelter. The CalWORKs program also provides permanent housing assistance to pay rent or a security deposit, as specified, in order to secure housing for the family or prevent eviction. Under existing law, eligibility for homeless assistance is limited to one period of up to 16 consecutive days in a lifetime, and eligibility for permanent housing assistance is limited to one payment of assistance, subject to specified exceptions for homelessness caused by domestic violence, illness, or sudden or unusual circumstances beyond the control of the family. Existing law authorizes a county to require certain recipients of homeless assistance to participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan as a condition of eligibility for homeless assistance benefits.
This bill would increase the duration of homeless assistance benefits to 30 days and would delete the limitation on the number of times a recipient may receive homeless assistance or permanent housing assistance benefits.
The bill would limit the number of times a family may receive temporary shelter assistance to once per year.
The bill would also delete the authority for the county to require a homelessness avoidance case plan as a condition of eligibility for homeless assistance benefits. Because this bill would increase the administrative duties of counties, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would, instead, provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, a certified copy of a birth, death, marriage, or military service record may only be supplied by the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder to an authorized person, as defined, who submits a written, faxed, or digitized image request accompanied by a notarized statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the applicant is an authorized person.
This bill would, until January 1, 2021, if the request for a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record is made electronically, authorize the official to accept an electronic acknowledgment verifying the identity of the applicant using a multilayered remote identity proofing process. If an applicant’s identity cannot be established electronically, the bill would require the applicant to include with his or her request a statement of identity notarized pursuant to existing law. The bill would require the verification to comply with specified provisions and protect the personal information of the applicant and guard against identity theft. The bill would require the State Registrar and any city or county that fulfills electronic requests without a notarized statement of identity to report to the Attorney General and the Legislature on or before January 1, 2019, regarding the number and types of requests and the availability of consumer protection mechanisms, as specified.
This bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to implement its procedures relating to electronic verification through an all-county letter or similar instruction from the State Registrar without taking regulatory action. The bill would specifically authorize the department to accept an electronic verification of identity accompanied by an electronic statement sworn under penalty of perjury for the above purposes. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Section 103526 of, and to add and repeal Section 103527.5 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to vital records."

An amount equal to the reasonable costs incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, not to exceed a maximum of 5 percent of the earnings of this fund and not to exceed the amount appropriated in the annual Budget Act for this function, shall be deducted from the earnings prior to distribution. However, if the 13-week Daily Treasury Bill Rate, as published by the United States Department of the Treasury, on the last day of the state’s fiscal year is below 1 percent, then the above-noted reasonable costs shall not exceed a maximum of 8 percent of the earnings of this fund for the subsequent fiscal year, shall not exceed the amount appropriated in the annual Budget Act for this function, and shall be deducted from the earnings prior to distribution.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an agency prematurely withdraws moneys deposited in a medium- or long-term investment, the agency shall pay its fair share of any penalty imposed, as determined by the Treasurer.
16429.54.
(a) The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Advisory Board is hereby established, consisting of five members. The chairperson shall be the Treasurer or his or her designated representative.

Existing
law creates the Local Agency Investment Fund, a trust fund in the custody of the Treasurer, in which local governments and other specified governmental entities may deposit, for investment, moneys that are not required for immediate needs. Existing law authorizes the Treasurer, with the advice of the Local Investment Advisory Board, to invest the moneys in the fund. Existing law requires the board to be made up of 5 members, including the Treasurer or his or her representative, 2 members appointed by the Treasurer who are experienced in the field of investment, and 2 members appointed by the Treasurer who are treasurers, finance or fiscal officers, or business managers employed by a county, city or local district, or municipal corporation of this state. Existing law establishes that the term of office of each appointed member of the board is 2 years.
This bill would extend the term of each of the appointed members of the board to 3 years. The bill would also make several nonsubstantive changes.
(2) Existing law creates the Pooled Money Investment Board and authorizes it to determine whether any money on deposit in the State Treasury, with specified exceptions, is not necessary for immediate use and to designate that money as “surplus money.” Existing law requires transfer of this surplus money to the Surplus Money Investment Fund and requires that the moneys be invested by the Treasurer in specified eligible investment vehicles.
Existing law creates the Local Agency Investment Fund, a trust fund in the custody of the Treasurer, in which local governments and other specified governmental entities may deposit, for investment, moneys that are not required for immediate needs. Existing law authorizes the Treasurer, with the advice of the Local Investment Advisory Board, to invest the moneys in the fund in specified securities that are eligible for the investment of surplus state funds.
This bill would create the Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund to receive voluntary deposit of funds by a governmental entity so that those funds may benefit from the intermediate or long-term investments authorized by this bill. The bill would, in addition, authorize investment of moneys that are deposited in the Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund in long-term corporate and government bonds, in gold, and in convertible securities.
This bill would establish the Long Term Investment Board. The board would consist of 5 members with the Treasurer as the chair. The Treasurer would select the remaining 4 members, based upon specified criteria, for 2-year terms. The board’s primary purpose would be to advise and assist the Treasurer in formulating the investment and reinvestment of moneys in the fund and the acquisition, retention, management, and disposition of investments of the fund. The bill would require the board to submit quarterly and annual reports regarding the performance of the investments in the fund to the Legislature and to the Department of Finance.","An act to amend Section 16429.2

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) The State of California has officially recognized the Armenian Genocide each year for decades and has repeatedly urged the Republic of Turkey to acknowledge the facts of the Armenian Genocide and work toward a just resolution, honor its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(b) Genocide is defined by the United Nations as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
(c) Genocide denial is widely viewed as among the final stages of genocide and serves to perpetuate the effects of genocide even after the active phases of extermination, massacres, forced marches, and deportation have ended.
(d) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in an ongoing campaign of genocide denial and historical revisionism by refusing to acknowledge its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, refusing to compensate its victims, and actively pursuing a well-funded political lobbying campaign throughout the United States, including in California, to rewrite history and defeat legislation recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
(e) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in efforts to effect Armenian cultural erasure since the founding of the Republic of Turkey, including, but not limited to, ethnic cleansings and the destruction of sacred Armenian religious sites.
(f) Reference in Turkey by any scholar, journalist, or other person to the massacre and deportation of Armenians in 1915 to 1923, inclusive, as genocide can be criminally prosecuted under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.
(g) The State of California is home to the largest Armenian American population in the United States, and Armenians living in California, most of whom are direct descendants of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide, have enriched our state through their leadership and contributions in business, agriculture, academia, government, and the arts, yet continue to suffer the effects of the continued denial campaign by the government of Turkey.
(h) The State of California, as the world’s eighth largest economy, and in accordance with principles of human rights and justice, has taken the lead in adopting legislation to divest from South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Sudan for its genocide in Darfur, and Iran for its support of international terrorism, imposing economic consequences upon regimes that engage in conduct and policy that violate human rights or constitute crimes against humanity.
(i) The State of California, through its Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and its State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS), directly invests public funds in the government of Turkey, which then reaps profits while actively denying the Armenian Genocide, funding its continued campaign of denial, at least in part, through these investments in its economy.
(j) By investing public funds in the government of Turkey, the State of California as the embodiment of its citizens contradicts its longstanding, just position of recognizing the Armenian Genocide and urging the government of Turkey to acknowledge its responsibility and work toward a just resolution by honoring its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, to end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and to return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(k) It is the government of Turkey, not the people of Turkey, that is responsible for Turkey’s continued egregious violations of human rights and active pursuit of genocide denial, cultural erasure, and historical revisionism.
(l) PERS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of $185,000,000.
(m) STRS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of several hundred million dollars.
(n) Investment in the Republic of Turkey enables its government to continue to deny justice to the Armenian people.
(o) Divesting these funds would ensure that the State of California is in no way complicit in the continued denial of the Armenian Genocide by the government of Turkey and would encourage said government to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide and to reach a fair and just resolution of reparations for the survivors of the Armenian Genocide.

Section 7513.76 is added to the Government Code, to read:

(3) “Turkey” means the Republic of Turkey or any territory under the administration or control of Turkey.
(4) “Public employee retirement funds” means the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund described in Section 20062 and the Teachers’ Retirement Fund described in Section 22167 of the Education Code.
(b) The board shall not make additional or new investments or renew existing investments of public employee retirement funds in any investment vehicle in Turkey that meets either of the following criteria:
(1) The investment vehicle is issued by the government of Turkey.
(2) The investment vehicle is owned, controlled, or managed by the government of Turkey.
(c) The board shall liquidate investments in Turkey in an investment vehicle described in subdivision (b)
on or before July 1, 2018.
within six months of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey.
In making a determination whether to liquidate investments, the board shall constructively engage with the government of Turkey to establish whether the government of Turkey is transitioning to publicly accepting its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide.
(d)
On or before January 1, 2019,
Within one year of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey,
the board shall file a report with the Legislature, in compliance with Section 9795, and the Governor, that shall include the following:
(1) A list of investment vehicles in Turkey of which the board has liquidated its investments pursuant to subdivision (c).

(3) A list of investment vehicles in Turkey of which the board has not liquidated its investments as a result of a determination made pursuant to subdivision (e) that a sale or transfer of investments is inconsistent with the fiduciary responsibilities of the board as described in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution and the board’s findings adopted in support of that determination.
(e) Nothing in this section shall require a board to take action as described in this section unless the board determines in good faith that the action described in this section is consistent with the fiduciary responsibilities of the board described in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.

The California Constitution qualifies this grant of powers by reserving to the Legislature the authority to prohibit investments if it is in the public interest and the prohibition satisfies standards of fiduciary care and loyalty required of a retirement board. Existing law prohibits the boards of administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and State Teachers’ Retirement System from making investments in certain countries and in thermal coal companies, as specified, subject to the boards’ plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the systems.
This bill would prohibit the boards of administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and State Teachers’ Retirement System from making additional or new investments, or renewing existing investments, of public employee retirement funds in an investment vehicle in Turkey that is issued by the government of Turkey or that is owned, controlled, or managed by the government of Turkey. The bill would require the boards to liquidate existing investments in Turkey in these types of investment vehicles
on or before July 1, 2018,
within 6 months of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey,
subject to engagement with the government of Turkey regarding whether it is transitioning to publicly accepting its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide. The bill would require these boards,
on or before January 1, 2019,
within one year of the passage of a federal law imposing sanctions on Turkey,
to make a specified report to the Legislature and the Governor regarding these actions. The bill would provide that its provisions do not require a board to take any action that the board determines in good faith is inconsistent with its constitutional fiduciary responsibilities to the retirement system. The bill would indemnify from the General Fund and hold harmless the present, former, and future board members, officers, and employees of, and investment managers under contract with, in connection with actions relating to these investments.","An act to amend Section 16642 of, and to add Section 7513.76 to, the Government Code, relating to public employee retirement systems."

SECTION 1.
Section 1305 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1305.

(B) The court’s jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and authority to release bail may be extended for not more than 90 days from the arraignment date originally set by the jailer pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1269b if either of the following occur:
(i) The prosecutor requests in writing or in open court that the arraignment be continued to allow the prosecutor time to file the complaint.

At the same time, the court shall mail a copy of the forfeiture notice to the bail agent whose name appears on the bond. The clerk shall also execute a certificate of mailing of the forfeiture notice and shall place the certificate in the court’s file. If the notice of forfeiture is required to be mailed pursuant to this section, the 180-day period provided for in this section shall be extended by a period of five days to allow for the mailing.
(2) If the surety is an authorized corporate surety, and if the bond plainly displays the mailing address of the corporate surety and the bail agent, then notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the surety at that address and to the bail agent, and mailing alone to the surety or the bail agent shall not constitute compliance with this section.
(3) The surety or depositor shall be released of all obligations under the bond if any of the following conditions apply:
(A) The clerk fails to mail the notice of forfeiture in accordance with this section within 30 days after the entry of the forfeiture.

If the court fails to so act on its own motion, then the surety’s or depositor’s obligations under the bond shall be immediately vacated and the bond exonerated. An order vacating the forfeiture and exonerating the bond may be made on terms that are just and do not exceed the terms imposed in similar situations with respect to other forms of pretrial release.
(2) If, within the county where the case is located, the defendant is surrendered to custody by the bail or is arrested in the underlying case within the 180-day period, and is subsequently released from custody prior to an appearance in court, the court shall, on its own motion, direct the order of forfeiture to be vacated and the bond exonerated. If the court fails to so act on its own motion, then the surety’s or depositor’s obligations under the bond shall be immediately vacated and the bond exonerated. An order vacating the forfeiture and exonerating the bond may be made on terms that are just and do not exceed the terms imposed in similar situations with respect to other forms of pretrial release.
(3) If, outside the county where the case is located, the defendant is surrendered to custody by the bail or is arrested in the underlying case within the 180-day period, the court shall vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bail.
(4) In lieu of exonerating the bond, the court may order the bail reinstated and the defendant released on the same bond if both of the following conditions are met:
(A) The bail is given prior notice of the reinstatement.
(B) The bail has not surrendered the defendant.
(d) In the case of a permanent disability, the court shall direct the order of forfeiture to be vacated and the bail or money or property deposited as bail exonerated if, within 180 days of the date of forfeiture or within 180 days of the date of mailing of the notice, if notice is required under subdivision (b), it is made apparent to the satisfaction of the court that both of the following conditions are met:
(1) The defendant is deceased or otherwise permanently unable to appear in the court due to illness, insanity, or detention by military or civil authorities.
(2) The absence of the defendant is without the connivance of the bail.

(A) The defendant is temporarily disabled by reason of illness, insanity, or detention by military or civil authorities.
(B) Based upon the temporary disability, the defendant is unable to appear in court during the remainder of the 180-day period.
(C) The absence of the defendant is without the connivance of the bail.
(2) The period of the tolling shall be extended for a reasonable period of time, at the discretion of the court, after the cessation of the disability to allow for the return of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court.
(f) In all cases where a defendant is in custody beyond the jurisdiction of the court that ordered the bail forfeited, and the prosecuting agency elects not to seek extradition after being informed of the location of the defendant, the court shall vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond on terms that are just and do not exceed the terms imposed in similar situations with respect to other forms of pretrial release.
(g) In all cases of forfeiture where a defendant is not in custody and is beyond the jurisdiction of the state, is temporarily detained, by the bail agent, in the presence of a local law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction in which the defendant is located, and is positively identified by that law enforcement officer as the wanted defendant in an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury, and the prosecuting agency elects not to seek extradition after being informed of the location of the defendant, the court shall vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond on terms that are just and do not exceed the terms imposed in similar situations with respect to other forms of pretrial release.
(h) In cases arising under subdivision (g), if the bail agent and the prosecuting agency agree that additional time is needed to return the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court, and the prosecuting agency agrees to the tolling of the 180-day period, the court may, on the basis of the agreement, toll the 180-day period within which to vacate the forfeiture. The court may order tolling for up to the length of time agreed upon by the parties.
(i) As used in this section, “arrest” includes a hold placed on the defendant in the underlying case while he or she is in custody on other charges.
(j) A motion filed in a timely manner within the 180-day period may be heard within 30 days of the expiration of the 180-day period. The court may extend the 30-day period upon a showing of good cause. The motion may be made by the surety insurer,","Existing law generally regulates the provision of bail or bond, including forfeiture, vacation of forfeiture, and exoneration of bail or bond. Existing law requires the court to declare bail to be forfeited if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear as specified. Existing law denies the court jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and requires the bail to be released of all obligations under the bond if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of arraignment.
This bill would authorize an extension of the court’s jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and authority to release bail for not more than 90 days from the date of the arraignment if the arraignment is properly continued to allow the prosecutor time to file the complaint or if the defendant requests the extension in writing or in open court.","An act to amend Section 1305 of the Penal Code, relating to bail."

(l) (1) To enhance understanding of the efficacy and adverse effects of marijuana as a pharmacological agent, the program shall conduct focused controlled clinical trials on the usefulness of marijuana in patients diagnosed with AIDS or HIV, cancer, glaucoma, or seizures or muscle spasms associated with a chronic, debilitating condition. The program may add research on other serious illnesses, provided that resources are available and medical information justifies the research. The studies shall focus on comparisons of both the efficacy and safety of methods of administering the drug to patients, including inhalational, tinctural, and oral, evaluate possible uses of marijuana as a primary or adjunctive treatment, and develop further information on optimal dosage, timing, mode of administration, and variations in the effects of different cannabinoids and varieties of marijuana.
(2) The program shall examine the safety of marijuana in patients with various medical disorders, including marijuana’s interaction with other drugs, relative safety of inhalation versus oral forms, and the effects on mental function in medically ill persons.
(3) The program shall be limited to providing for objective scientific research to ascertain the efficacy and safety of marijuana as part of medical treatment, and should not be construed as encouraging or sanctioning the social or recreational use of marijuana.
(m) (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the program shall, prior to any approving proposals, seek to obtain research protocol guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and shall, if the National Institutes of Health issues research protocol guidelines, comply with those guidelines.
(2) If, after a reasonable period of time of not less than six months and not more than a year has elapsed from the date the program seeks to obtain guidelines pursuant to paragraph (1), no guidelines have been approved, the program may proceed using the research protocol guidelines it develops.
(n) In order to maximize the scope and size of the marijuana studies, the program may do any of the following:
(1) Solicit, apply for, and accept funds from foundations, private individuals, and all other funding sources that can be used to expand the scope or timeframe of the marijuana studies that are authorized under this section. The program shall not expend more than 5 percent of its General Fund allocation in efforts to obtain money from outside sources.
(2) Include within the scope of the marijuana studies other marijuana research projects that are independently funded and that meet the requirements set forth in subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive. In no case shall the program accept any funds that are offered with any conditions other than that the funds be used to study the efficacy and safety of marijuana as part of medical treatment. Any donor shall be advised that funds given for purposes of this section will be used to study both the possible benefits and detriments of marijuana and that he or she will have no control over the use of these funds.
(o) (1) Within six months of the effective date of this section, the program shall report to the Legislature, the Governor, and the Attorney General on the progress of the marijuana studies.
(2) Thereafter, the program shall issue a report to the Legislature every six months detailing the progress of the studies. The interim reports required under this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, data on all of the following:
(A) The names and number of diseases or conditions under study.
(B) The number of patients enrolled in each study by disease.
(C) Any scientifically valid preliminary findings.
(p) If the Regents of the University of California implement this section, the President of the University of California shall appoint a multidisciplinary Scientific Advisory Council, not to exceed 15 members, to provide policy guidance in the creation and implementation of the program. Members shall be chosen on the basis of scientific expertise. Members of the council shall serve on a voluntary basis, with reimbursement for expenses incurred in the course of their participation. The members shall be reimbursed for travel and other necessary expenses incurred in their performance of the duties of the council.
(q) No more than 10 percent of the total funds appropriated may be used for all aspects of the administration of this section.
(r) This section shall be implemented only to the extent that funding for its purposes is appropriated by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act.","(1) Existing law, the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), provides for the licensure of persons engaged in specified activities relating to medical marijuana and establishes other regulatory provisions. That act also requires each licensing authority to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report on the authority’s activities and post the report on the authority’s Internet Web site.
This bill would require the report to also include the number of appeals from the denial of state licenses or other disciplinary actions taken by the licensing authority, the average time spent on these appeals, and the number of complaints submitted by citizens or representatives of cities or counties regarding licensees, as specified.
(2) Existing law authorizes the creation by the University of California of the California Marijuana Research Program, the purpose of which is to develop and conduct studies intended to ascertain the general medical safety and efficacy of marijuana, and if found valuable, to develop medical guidelines for the appropriate administration and use of marijuana.
This bill would specify that the studies may include studies to ascertain the effect of marijuana on motor skills.
(3) Existing law, until one year after the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation posts a notice on its Internet Web site that licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses pursuant to the MMRSA, exempts cooperatives and collectives who cultivate medical cannabis for qualified patients from criminal sanctions for specified activities related to the growing, sale, and distribution of marijuana.
This bill, during that same period, would exempt collectives and cooperatives that manufacture medical cannabis products from criminal sanctions for manufacturing medical cannabis if the cooperative or collective meets specified requirements, including using specified manufacturing processes and possessing a valid local license, permit, or other authorization.","An act to amend Section 19353 of the Business and Professions Code, and to amend Sections 11362.775 and 11362.9 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to medical marijuana."

SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law makes it unlawful for a person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug to drive a vehicle. Existing law makes it unlawful for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a commercial motor vehicle, as defined. Existing law also makes it unlawful for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a commercial motor vehicle and concurrently do any act forbidden by law or neglect any duty imposed by law that proximately causes bodily injury to another person other than the driver.
This bill would make it unlawful, commencing July 1, 2018, for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a motor vehicle when a passenger for hire, as defined, is a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the offense. The bill would also make it unlawful, commencing July 1, 2018, for a person who has 0.04 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a motor vehicle, as specified, and concurrently do any act or neglect any duty that proximately causes bodily injury to another person other than the driver. Because this bill would expand the application of a crime to more people, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

SECTION 1.
Section 709 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
709.
(a) (1) Whenever the court has a doubt that a minor who is subject to any juvenile proceedings is mentally competent, the court shall suspend all proceedings and proceed pursuant to this section.
(2) A minor is mentally incompetent for purposes of this section if he or she is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings, including his or her role in the proceedings, or unable to assist counsel in conducting a defense in a rational manner, including a lack of a rational and factual understanding of the nature of the charges or proceedings. Incompetency may result from the presence of any condition or conditions, including, but not limited to, mental illness, mental disorder, developmental disability, or developmental immaturity. Except as specifically provided otherwise, this section applies to a minor who is alleged to come within the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to Section 601 or 602.
(3) During the pendency of any juvenile proceeding, the court may receive information from any source regarding the minor’s ability to understand the proceedings. The minor’s counsel or the court may express a doubt as to the minor’s competency. The receipt of information or the expression of doubt of the minor’s counsel does not automatically require the suspension of proceedings. If the court has a doubt as to the minor’s competency, the court shall suspend the proceedings.
(b) (1) Unless the parties stipulate to a finding that the minor lacks competency, or the parties are willing to submit on the issue of the minor’s lack of competency, the court shall appoint an expert to evaluate the minor and determine whether the minor suffers from a mental illness, mental disorder, developmental disability, developmental immaturity, or other condition affecting competency and, if so, whether the minor is competent.
(2) The expert shall have expertise in child and adolescent development and forensic evaluation of juveniles for purposes of adjudicating competency, shall be familiar with competency standards and accepted criteria used in evaluating juvenile competency, and shall have received training in conducting juvenile competency evaluations.
(3) The expert shall personally interview the minor and review all of the available records provided, including, but not limited to, medical, education, special education, probation, child welfare, mental health, regional center, and court records, and any other relevant information that is available. The expert shall consult with the minor’s counsel and any other person who has provided information to the court regarding the minor’s lack of competency. The expert shall gather a developmental history of the minor. If any information is unavailable to the expert, he or she shall note in the report the efforts to obtain that information. The expert shall administer age-appropriate testing specific to the issue of competency unless the facts of the particular case render testing unnecessary or inappropriate. In a written report, the expert shall opine whether the minor has the sufficient present ability to consult with his or her counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he or she has a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him or her. The expert shall also state the basis for these conclusions. If the expert concludes that the minor lacks competency, the expert shall make recommendations regarding the type of remediation services that would be effective in assisting the minor in attaining competency, and, if possible, the expert shall address the likelihood of the minor attaining competency within a reasonable period of time.
(4) The Judicial
Council
Council, in conjunction with groups or individuals representing judges, defense counsel, district attorneys, counties, advocates for people with developmental and mental disabilities, state psychologists and psychiatrists, professional associations and accredited bodies for psychologists and psychiatrists, and other interested stakeholders,
shall adopt a rule of court identifying the training and experience needed for an expert to be competent in forensic evaluations of
juveniles, and
juveniles. The Judicial Council
shall develop and adopt rules for the implementation of the other requirements in this subdivision.
(5) Statements made to the appointed expert during the minor’s competency evaluation, statements made by the minor to mental health professionals during the remediation proceedings, and any fruits of those statements shall not be used in any other hearing against the minor in either juvenile or adult court.
(6) The district attorney or minor’s counsel may retain or seek the appointment of additional qualified experts who may testify during the competency hearing. The expert’s report and qualifications shall be disclosed to the opposing party within a reasonable time before, but no later than five court days before, the hearing. If disclosure is not made in accordance with this paragraph, the expert shall not be allowed to testify, and the expert’s report shall not be considered by the court unless the court finds good cause to consider the expert’s report and testimony. If, after disclosure of the report, the opposing party requests a continuance in order to further prepare for the hearing and shows good cause for the continuance, the court shall grant a continuance for a reasonable period of time.
(7) If the expert believes the minor is developmentally disabled, the court shall appoint the director of a regional center for developmentally disabled individuals described in Article 1 (commencing with Section 4620) of Chapter 5 of Division 4.5, or his or her designee, to evaluate the minor. The director of the regional center, or his or her designee, shall determine whether the minor is eligible for services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500)), and shall provide the court with a written report informing the court of his or her determination. The court’s appointment of the director of the regional center for determination of eligibility for services shall not delay the court’s proceedings for determination of competency.
(8) An expert’s opinion that a minor is developmentally disabled does not supersede an independent determination by the regional center regarding the minor’s eligibility for services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500)).
(9) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to authorize or require either of the following:
(A) Placement of a minor who is incompetent in a developmental center or community facility operated by the State Department of Developmental Services without a determination by a regional center director, or his or her designee, that the minor has a developmental disability and is eligible for services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500)).
(B) Determinations regarding the competency of a minor by the director of the regional center or his or her designee.
(c) The question of the minor’s competency shall be determined at an evidentiary hearing unless there is a stipulation or submission by the parties on the findings of the expert.
The minor has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is incompetent.
It shall be presumed that the minor is mentally competent, unless it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the minor is mentally incompetent.
(d) If the court finds the minor to be competent, the court shall reinstate proceedings and proceed commensurate with the court’s jurisdiction.
(e) If the court finds, by a preponderance of evidence, that the minor is incompetent, all proceedings shall remain suspended for a period of time that is no longer than reasonably necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future, or the court no longer retains jurisdiction. During this time, the court may make orders that it deems appropriate for services. Further, the court may rule on motions that do not require the participation of the minor in the preparation of the motions. These motions include, but are not limited to, all of the following:
(1) Motions to dismiss.
(2) Motions regarding a change in the placement of the minor.
(3) Detention hearings.
(4) Demurrers.
(f) Upon a finding of incompetency, the court shall refer the minor to services designed to help the minor attain competency. Service providers and evaluators shall adhere to the standards stated in this section and the California Rules of Court. Services shall be provided in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety. Priority shall be given to minors in custody. Service providers shall determine the likelihood of the minor attaining competency within a reasonable period of time, and if the opinion is that the minor will not attain competency within a reasonable period of time, the minor shall be returned to court at the earliest possible date. The court shall review remediation services at least every 30 calendar days for minors in custody and every 45 calendar days for minors out of custody.
(g) (1) Upon receipt of the recommendation by the remediation program, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on whether the minor is remediated or is able to be remediated unless the parties stipulate to, or agree to the recommendation of, the remediation program. If the recommendation is that the minor has attained competency, and if the minor disputes that recommendation, the burden is on the minor to prove by a preponderance of evidence that he or she remains incompetent. If the recommendation is that the minor is unable to be remediated and if the prosecutor disputes that recommendation, the burden is on the prosecutor to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the minor is remediable. If the prosecution contests the evaluation of continued incompetence, the minor shall be presumed incompetent and the prosecution shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the minor is competent. The provisions of subdivision (c) shall apply at this stage of the proceedings.
(2) If the court finds that the minor has been remediated, the court shall reinstate the proceedings.
(3) If the court finds that the minor has not yet been remediated, but is likely to be
remediated,
remediated within a reasonable period of time,
the court shall order the minor to return to the remediation program.
(4) If the court finds that the minor will not achieve
competency,
competency within a reasonable period of time,
the court shall dismiss the petition. The court may invite persons and agencies with information about the minor, including, but not limited to, the minor and his or her attorney, the probation department, parents, guardians, or relative caregivers, mental health treatment professionals, the public guardian, educational rights holders, education providers, and social services agencies, to the dismissal hearing to discuss any services that may be available to the minor after jurisdiction is terminated. If appropriate, the court shall refer the minor for evaluation pursuant to Article 6 (commencing with Section 5300) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 5 or Article 3 (commencing with Section 6550) of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of Division 6.
(5) In no case shall remediation extend beyond two years, or a period of time equal to the maximum term of detention for the most serious charge on the petition, whichever is shorter, on a petition that contains a felony offense. In no case shall remediation extend beyond one year, or a period of time equal to the maximum term of detention provided by law for the most serious offense, whichever is shorter, on a petition that contains only misdemeanor offenses.
(h) The presiding judge of the juvenile court, the probation department, the county mental health department, the public defender and other entity that provides representation for minors, the district attorney, the regional center, if appropriate, and any other participants that the presiding judge shall designate, shall develop a written protocol describing the competency process and a program to ensure that minors who are found incompetent receive appropriate remediation services.

SECTION 1.
Article 1 (commencing with Section 104250) is added to Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 103 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
Article  1. Diabetes.
104250.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is reported that one in seven adult Californians has diabetes, and the numbers are rising rapidly. The actual number of those whose lives are affected by diabetes is unknown and stands to be much higher when factoring in the incidence of type 1 diabetes and undiagnosed gestational diabetes.
(b) California has the greatest number of annual new cases of diabetes in the United States.
(c) The incidence of diabetes amongst all Californians has increased 32 percent over the past decade.
(d) Over 11.4 million people in California have prediabetes, a condition that is a precursor to full onset type 2 diabetes. This suggests that the total population of those diagnosed will continue to rise in the absence of interventions.
(e) The prevalence of diagnosed gestational diabetes in California has increased 60 percent in just seven years, from 3.3 percent of hospital deliveries in 1998 to 5.3 percent of hospital deliveries in 2005, with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that the diagnosis rate could run as high as 18.3 percent.
(f) The fiscal impact to the State of California, including total health care and related costs for the treatment of diabetes, was over $35.9 billion in 2010.
(g) There is a disproportionate prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Californians who are Black, Hispanic, or of Asian origin compared to the general population. As of 2010, the incidence of diabetes among Black and Hispanic people was nearly double that among non-Hispanic Whites at approximately 14 percent. Asians and Pacific Islanders, in the aggregate, experience higher rates of diabetes than other populations. Certain groups within the Asian and Pacific Islander population experience the highest prevalence and risk overall, including Filipino, South Asians, and Pacific Islanders, who suffer from diabetes at rates of 15 percent, 16 percent, and more than 18 percent, respectively.
(h) A recent study of a large state with a sizable diabetes population found that the rate of diagnosed diabetes in that state’s Medicaid population is nearly double that of its general population.
(i) There is no cure for any type of diabetes; however, there is evidence that diabetes can be prevented or delayed in onset through lifestyle changes and medical intervention.
(j) Diabetes, when left untreated, can lead to serious and costly complications and a reduced lifespan.
(k) Many of these serious complications can be delayed or avoided with timely diagnosis, effective patient self-care, and improved social awareness.
(l) It is the intent of the Legislature to require the State Department of Public Health to provide to the Legislature information, including the annual federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention progress report, on diabetes prevention and management activities conducted by the State Department of Public Health and expenditures associated with diabetes prevention and management activities. These activities are set forth by the State Department of Public Health in the California Wellness Plan 2014 and the report dated September 2014 entitled “Burden of Diabetes in California.”
104251.
(a) The State Department of Public Health shall submit a report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2019, that includes a summary and compilation of recommendations on diabetes prevention and management, if any, from all of the following sources:
(1) The University of California.
(2) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(3) The California Wellness Plan.
(4) Other statewide diabetes stakeholder groups.
(5) Other entities identified by the department as having relevant findings and recommendations.
(b) The department shall include in the report any recommendations from those institutions on all of the following items:
(1) Evidence-based strategies to prevent or manage diabetes.
(2) An analysis of the financial impact diabetes and its complications have on the state.
(3) Policy recommendations for the prevention and management of diabetes.
(c) The department shall also include in the report a description of the existing level of coordination between state departments with regard to programmatic activities and the provision of information to the public regarding managing and preventing diabetes and its complications.
(d) Commencing July 1, 2017, the department shall annually post all of the following information on its Internet Web site:
(1) A summary of the amount and source of any funding directed to the department for programs and activities aimed at preventing or managing diabetes.
(2) A summary of the expenditures by the department on programs and activities aimed at preventing or managing diabetes.
(e) (1) The requirement for submitting a report imposed under subdivision (a) is inoperative on January 1, 2024.
(2) The report submitted to the Legislature pursuant to this section shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties pertaining to, among other things, protecting, preserving, and advancing public health, including disseminating information regarding diseases.

(2) Subject to review and approval by the commission, the procurement entity shall be permitted to recover reasonable administrative and procurement costs through the retail rates of end-use customers that are served by the procurement entity and are directly benefiting from the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources.
(g) Procurement and administrative costs associated with contracts entered into by an electrical corporation for eligible renewable energy resources pursuant to this article and approved by the commission are reasonable and prudent and shall be recoverable in rates.
(h) Construction, alteration, demolition, installation, and repair work on an eligible renewable energy resource that receives production incentives pursuant to Section 25742 of the Public Resources Code, including work performed to qualify, receive, or maintain production incentives, are “public works” for the purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code.

By July 1, 2017, the commission shall update the criteria for the rank ordering and selection of least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 399.13 to identify the value of maintaining existing baseload resources to achieve the goal of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, defined as including an electrical corporation, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers during specified compliance periods. The program requires the commission to direct each electrical corporation to annually prepare a renewable energy procurement plan to satisfy its procurement requirements pursuant to the program. As part of the renewable energy procurement plan process, the commission is required to adopt rules establishing a process that provides criteria for the rank ordering and selection of least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources to comply with the program’s procurement obligations and requires that the criteria take specified matters into account, including workforce recruitment, training, and retention efforts, as specified.
This bill would require that the criteria take into account jobs retained associated with contracting for existing eligible renewable energy resources.
The bill would require the commission to update the criteria by July 1, 2017, to identify the value of maintaining existing baseload resources to achieve the goal of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources.","An act to amend Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity."

SECTION 1.
Section 1063.2 of the Insurance Code is amended to read:
1063.2.
(a) The association shall pay and discharge covered claims, and in connection therewith, pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions. It may do so either directly by itself or through a servicing facility or through a contract for reinsurance and assumption of liabilities by one or more member insurers or through a contract with the liquidator, upon terms satisfactory to the association and to the liquidator, under which payments on covered claims would be made by the liquidator using funds provided by the association.
(b) (1) The association shall be a party in interest in all proceedings involving a covered claim, and shall have the same rights as the insolvent insurer would have had if not in liquidation, including, but not limited to, the right to all of the following:
(A) Appear, defend, and appeal a claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(B) Receive notice of, investigate, adjust, compromise, settle, and pay a covered claim.
(C) Investigate, handle, and deny a noncovered claim.
(2) The association shall have no cause of action against the insureds of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except as provided by this article.
(3) Nothing in paragraph (2) limits the association’s right to pursue unpaid reimbursements owed by an employer pursuant to a workers’ compensation insurance policy with a deductible if the employer was obligated to reimburse the insurer for benefits payments and related expenses paid by the insurer or the association from a special deposit or from other association funds pursuant to the terms of the policy and related agreements.
(c) (1) If damages against uninsured motorists are recoverable by the claimant from his or her own insurer, the applicable limits of the uninsured motorist coverage shall be a credit against a covered claim payable under this article. Any person having a claim that may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the insured, except that if it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he or she shall seek recovery first from the association of the permanent location of the property, and if it is a workers’ compensation claim, he or she shall seek recovery first from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any recovery under this article shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent. A member insurer may recover in subrogation from the association only one-half of any amount paid by that insurer under uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death (and nothing for a payment for anything else), in those cases where the injured person insured by such an insurer has proceeded under his or her uninsured motorist coverage on the ground that the tortfeasor is uninsured as a result of the insolvency of his or her liability insurer (an insolvent insurer as defined in this article), provided that the member insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against the tortfeasor. Any amount paid a claimant in excess of the amount authorized by this section may be recovered by action, or other proceeding, brought by the association.
(2) Any claimant having collision coverage on a loss that is covered by the insolvent company’s liability policy shall first proceed against his or her collision carrier. Neither that claimant nor the collision carrier, if it is a member of the association, shall have the right to sue or continue a suit against the insured of the insolvent insurance company for that collision damage.
(d) The association shall have the right to recover from any person who is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this article the amount of any covered claim and allocated claims expense paid on behalf of that person pursuant to this article.
(e) Any person having a claim or legal right of recovery under any governmental insurance or guaranty program that is also a covered claim, shall be required to first exhaust his or her right under the program. Any amount payable on a covered claim shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the program.
(f) “Covered claims” for unearned premium by lenders under insurance premium finance agreements as defined in Section 673 shall be computed as of the earliest cancellation date of the policy pursuant to Section 673.
(g) “Covered claims” shall not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer or the commissioner, as liquidator, or otherwise resulting from alleged or proven torts, nor shall any default judgment or stipulated judgment against the insolvent insurer, or against the insured of the insolvent insurer, be binding against the association.
(h) “Covered claims” shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney’s fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.

(A) Workers’ compensation claims.
(B) Homeowners’ claims and automobile claims, including all of the following:
(i) Automobile material damage.
(ii) Automobile liability (both personal injury and death and property damage).
(iii) Medical payments.
(iv) Uninsured motorist claims.
(C) Claims other than workers’ compensation, homeowners, and automobile, as defined above.
(3) Separate premium payments shall be required for each category.
(4) The premium payments for each category shall be used to pay the claims and costs allocated to that category.
(b) (1) The rate of premium charged shall be a uniform percentage of net direct written premium in the preceding calendar year applicable to that category.
(2) The rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories shall initially be based on the written premium of each insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the commissioner.
(3) The initial premium shall be adjusted by applying the same rate of premium charge as initially used to each insurer’s written premium as shown on the annual statement for the second year following the year on which the initial premium charge was based.
(4) (A) The difference between the initial premium charge and the adjusted premium charge shall be charged or credited to each member insurer by the association as soon as practical after the filing of the annual statements of the member insurers with the commissioner for the year on which the adjusted premium is based.
(B) Any credit due in a specific category to a member insurer as a result of the adjusted premium calculation shall be refunded to the member insurer.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section, “net direct written premiums” means the amount of gross premiums, less return premiums, received in that calendar year upon business done in this state, other than premiums received for reinsurance.
(2) In cases of a dispute as to the amount of the net direct written premium between the association and one of its member insurers, the written decision of the commissioner shall be final.
(d) (1) The premium charged to any member insurer for any of the three categories or a category established by the association shall not be more than 2 percent of the net direct premium written in that category in this state by that member insurer per year, starting on January 1, 2003, until December 31, 2007, and thereafter shall be 1 percent per year, until January 1, 2015.
(2) Commencing January 1, 2015, the premium charged to any member insurer for any of the three categories or a category established by the association shall not be more than 2 percent of the net direct written premium unless there are bonds outstanding that were issued pursuant to Article 14.25 (commencing with Section 1063.50) or Article 14.26 (commencing with Section 1063.70).
(3) If bonds issued pursuant to either article are outstanding, the premium charged to a member insurer for the category for which the bond proceeds are being used to pay claims and expenses shall not be more than 1 percent of the net direct written premium for that category.
(e) (1) The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the premium charge of any member insurer, if the premium charge would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect an amount of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. However, during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders by the company whose premium charge was deferred.
(2) Deferred premium charges shall be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums.
(f) After all covered claims of the insolvent insurer and expenses of administration have been paid, any unused premiums and any reimbursements or claims dividends from the liquidator remaining in any category shall be retained by the association and applied to reduce future premium charges in the appropriate category.
(g) The commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority to transact business in this state of a member insurer that fails to pay a premium when due and after demand has been made.
(h) Interest at a rate equal to the current federal reserve discount rate plus 2
1/2
percent per annum shall be added to the premium of any member insurer that fails to submit the premium requested by the association within 30 days after the mailing request. However, in no event shall the interest rate exceed the legal maximum.

1063.5.

(2) The association shall allocate its claim payments and costs, incurred or estimated to be incurred, to one or more of the following categories:
(A) Workers’ compensation claims.
(B) Homeowners’ claims and automobile claims, including all of the following:
(i) Automobile material damage.

(3) Separate premium payments shall be required for each category.
(4) The premium payments for each category shall be used to pay the claims and costs allocated to that category.
(b) (1) The rate of premium charged shall be a uniform percentage of net direct written premium in the preceding calendar year applicable to that category.
(2) The rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories shall be based on the net direct written premium of each member insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the commissioner.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section, “net direct written premiums” means the amount of gross premiums, less return premiums, received in that calendar year upon business done in this state, other than premiums received for reinsurance.
(2) In cases of a dispute as to the amount of the net direct written premium between the association and one of its member insurers, the written decision of the commissioner shall be final.
(d) In charging premiums to member insurers, the association shall adjust, if necessary, the net direct written premiums shown on a member insurer’s annual statement by excluding any premiums written for any lines of insurance or types of coverage not covered by this article under paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 1063.1.
(e) (1) The premium charged to any member insurer for any of the three categories or a category established by the association shall not be more than 2 percent of the net direct written premium unless there are bonds outstanding that were issued pursuant to Article 14.25 (commencing with Section 1063.50) or Article 14.26 (commencing with Section 1063.70).
(2) If bonds issued pursuant to either article are outstanding, the premium charged to a member insurer for the category for which the bond proceeds are being used to pay claims and expenses shall not be more than 1 percent of the net direct written premium for that category.
(f) (1) The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the premium charge of any member insurer, if the premium charge would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect an amount of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. However, during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders by the company whose premium charge was deferred.
(2) Deferred premium charges shall be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums.
(g) After all covered claims of insolvent insurers and expenses of administration have been paid, any unused premiums and any reimbursements or claims dividends from liquidators remaining in any category shall be retained by the association and applied to reduce future premium charges in the appropriate category.

(i) Interest at a rate equal to the current federal reserve discount rate plus 2
1/2
percent per annum shall be added to the premium of any member insurer that fails to submit the premium requested by the association within 30 days after the mailing request. However, in no event shall the interest rate exceed the legal maximum.

Section 1063.14 of the Insurance Code is amended and renumbered, to immediately precede Section 1063.14 of the Insurance Code, to read:
1063.135.
(a) The plan of operation adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1063 shall contain provisions whereby each member insurer is required to recoup in the year following the premium charge a sum reasonably calculated to recoup the premium charge paid by the member insurer under this article by way of a surcharge on premiums charged for insurance policies to which this article applies. Amounts recouped shall not be considered premiums for any other purpose, including the computation of gross premium tax or agents’ commission.
(b) The amount of any surcharge shall be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. The association shall determine the rate of the surcharge and the collection period for each category and these shall be mandatory for all member insurers of the association who write business in those categories. Member insurers who collect surcharges in excess of premiums paid pursuant to Section 1063.45 for an insolvent insurer shall remit the excess to the association as an additional premium within 30 days after the association has determined the amount of the excess recoupment and given notice to the member insurer of that amount. The excess shall be applied to reduce future premium charges in the appropriate category.
(c) The plan of operation may permit a member insurer to omit collection of the surcharge from its insureds when the expense of collecting the surcharge would exceed the amount of the surcharge. However, nothing in this section shall relieve the member insurer of its obligation to recoup the amount of surcharge otherwise collectible.
(d) This section shall apply only to premium charges paid prior to January 1, 2017.
(e) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 5.
Section 1063.14 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
1063.14.
(a) (1) The plan of operation adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1063 shall contain provisions whereby each member insurer is required to recoup in the year following the premium charge a sum calculated to recoup the premium charge paid by the member insurer under this article by way of a surcharge on premiums charged for insurance policies to which this article applies.
(2) Amounts recouped shall not be considered premiums for any other purpose, including the computation of gross premium tax or agents’ commission.
(b) (1) The amount of any surcharge shall be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. The association shall determine the rate of the surcharge and the collection period for each category, and these shall be mandatory for all member insurers of the association who write business in those categories.
(2) Each member insurer shall file a report in accordance with the provisions of the plan of operation indicating the amount of surcharges it has collected.
(A) Member insurers who collect surcharges in excess of premium charges paid in the preceding year pursuant to Section 1063.5 shall remit the excess to the association as an additional premium within 30 days after the association has determined the amount of the excess recoupment and given notice to the member insurer of that amount. The excess shall be applied to reduce future premium charges in the appropriate category.
(B) Member insurers who report surcharge collections that are less than what they paid in the preceding year’s premium charge shall receive reimbursement from the association for the shortfall in surcharge collection.
(c) (1) The plan of operation may permit a member insurer to omit collection of the surcharge from its insureds when the expense of collecting the surcharge would exceed the amount of the surcharge.
(2) A member insurer electing to omit collecting surcharges from any of its insureds shall not be entitled to any reimbursement from the association pursuant to subdivision (b).
(3) However, nothing in this section shall relieve the member insurer of its obligation to recoup the amount of surcharge otherwise collectible.
(d) This section shall apply only to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017.","(1) Existing law creates the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) and requires all insurers admitted to transact specified insurance lines in this state to become members. Each time an insurer becomes insolvent, to the extent necessary to secure funds for payment of covered claims of that insolvent insurer and also for payment of reasonable costs of adjusting the claims, CIGA is required to collect premium payments from its member insurers sufficient to discharge its obligations, as specified.
This bill, among other things, would no longer require an insurer to become insolvent in order for CIGA to collect premium payments from the member insurers and would require CIGA to collect premiums in order to secure funds for the payment of its administrative expenses.
(2) Under existing law, CIGA is required to be a party in interest in all proceedings involving a covered claim, and has the same rights as the insolvent insurer would have had if not in liquidation, but CIGA has no cause of action against the insureds of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except as provided.
This bill would provide that the above-stated provision denying CIGA a cause of action against insureds does not limit CIGA’s right to pursue unpaid reimbursements owed by an employer pursuant to a workers’ compensation insurance policy with a deductible if the employer was obligated to reimburse the insurer for benefits payments and related expenses paid by the insurer or CIGA from a special deposit or from other CIGA funds pursuant to the terms of the policy and related agreements.
(3) Existing law requires that the rate of premium charged be a uniform percentage of net direct written premium, as defined, in the preceding calendar year applicable to specific categories of insurance. The rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories are initially based on the written premium of each insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the Insurance Commissioner and are later adjusted, as provided. Existing law authorizes CIGA to refund any credit due in a specific category of insurance to a member insurer as a result of the adjusted premium calculation, as provided.
This bill would instead require CIGA, with regard to premium charges paid prior to January 1, 2017, to refund to a member insurer any credit due in a specific category as a result of the adjusted premium calculation.
This bill, with regard to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017, would delete the requirements that the rate of premium charges be initially based on the written premium of each insurer, that the premium charges be adjusted later as provided, and that the member insurer be eligible for a refund of any credit due to that member insurer as a result of the adjusted premium calculation, and would instead require that the rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories be based on the net direct written premium of each insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the commissioner. The bill would also make conforming changes.
(4) Existing law authorizes CIGA to exempt or defer a member insurer from paying the premium charge if the payment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect an amount of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. Deferred premium charges are required to be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. These payments are credited against future premium charges to those companies receiving larger premium charges by virtue of the deferment.
This bill would delete the requirement that the payments be credited against future premium charges to those companies receiving larger premium charges by virtue of the deferment.
(5) Existing law requires CIGA’s plan of operations to contain provisions requiring each member insurer to recoup the premium charge paid to CIGA from its insureds over a reasonable length of time by way of a reasonably calculated surcharge on insurance policies to which the provisions of CIGA apply.
This bill would instead require each member insurer to recoup the premium charge from its insureds in the year following the charge. The bill, with regard to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017, among other things, would require the member insurer to file a report in accordance with the provisions of the plan of operation indicating the amount of surcharges it has collected, and would prohibit a member insurer electing to omit collecting surcharges from any of its insureds from being entitled to any reimbursement from CIGA, as specified.","An act to amend Section 1063.2 of, to amend, renumber, and add Sections 1063.5 and 1063.14 of, and to repeal Sections 1063.45 and 1063.135 of, the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."

(a) The child has suffered, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer, serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the child by the child’s parent or guardian. For purposes of this subdivision, a court may find there is a substantial risk of serious future injury based on the manner in which a less serious injury was inflicted, a history of repeated inflictions of injuries on the child or the child’s siblings, or a combination of these and other actions by the parent or guardian that indicate the child is at risk of serious physical harm. For purposes of this subdivision, “serious physical harm” does not include reasonable and age-appropriate spanking to the buttocks if there is no evidence of serious physical injury.
(b) (1)  The child has suffered, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer, serious physical harm or illness, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child, or the willful or negligent failure of the child’s parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child from the conduct of the custodian with whom the child has been left, or by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent’s or guardian’s mental illness, developmental disability, or substance abuse. A child shall not be found to be a person described by this subdivision solely due to the lack of an emergency shelter for the family. Whenever it is alleged that a child comes within the jurisdiction of the court on the basis of the parent’s or guardian’s willful failure to provide adequate medical treatment or specific decision to provide spiritual treatment through prayer, the court shall give deference to the parent’s or guardian’s medical treatment, nontreatment, or spiritual treatment through prayer alone in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination, by an accredited practitioner thereof, and shall not assume jurisdiction unless necessary to protect the child from suffering serious physical harm or illness. In making its determination, the court shall consider (1) the nature of the treatment proposed by the parent or guardian, (2) the risks to the child posed by the course of treatment or nontreatment proposed by the parent or guardian, (3) the risk, if any, of the course of treatment being proposed by the petitioning agency, and (4) the likely success of the courses of treatment or nontreatment proposed by the parent or guardian and agency. The child shall continue to be a dependent child pursuant to this subdivision only so long as is necessary to protect the child from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.
(2) The Legislature finds and declares that a child who is sexually trafficked, as described in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, or who receives food or shelter in exchange for, or who is paid to perform, sexual acts described in Section 236.1 or 11165.1 of the Penal Code,
or who has engaged in the conduct described in subdivision (b) of Section 647 or Section 653.22 of the Penal Code,
and whose parent or guardian failed to, or was unable to, protect the child, is within the description of this subdivision, and that this finding is declaratory of existing law. These children shall be known as commercially sexually exploited children.
(c) The child is suffering serious emotional damage, or is at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage, evidenced by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or untoward aggressive behavior toward self or others, as a result of the conduct of the parent or guardian or who has no parent or guardian capable of providing appropriate care. A child shall not be found to be a person described by this subdivision if the willful failure of the parent or guardian to provide adequate mental health treatment is based on a sincerely held religious belief and if a less intrusive judicial intervention is available.
(d) The child has been sexually abused, or there is a substantial risk that the child will be sexually abused, as defined in Section 11165.1 of the Penal Code, by his or her parent or guardian or a member of his or her household, or the parent or guardian has failed to adequately protect the child from sexual abuse when the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that the child was in danger of sexual abuse.
(e) The child is under the age of five years and has suffered severe physical abuse by a parent, or by any person known by the parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was physically abusing the child. For the purposes of this subdivision, “severe physical abuse” means any of the following: any single act of abuse which causes physical trauma of sufficient severity that, if left untreated, would cause permanent physical disfigurement, permanent physical disability, or death; any single act of sexual abuse which causes significant bleeding, deep bruising, or significant external or internal swelling; or more than one act of physical abuse, each of which causes bleeding, deep bruising, significant external or internal swelling, bone fracture, or unconsciousness; or the willful, prolonged failure to provide adequate food. A child shall not be removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian on the basis of a finding of severe physical abuse unless the social worker has made an allegation of severe physical abuse pursuant to Section 332.
(f) The child’s parent or guardian caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.
(g) The child has been left without any provision for support; physical custody of the child has been voluntarily surrendered pursuant to Section 1255.7 of the Health and Safety Code and the child has not been reclaimed within the 14-day period specified in subdivision (g) of that section; the child’s parent has been incarcerated or institutionalized and cannot arrange for the care of the child; or a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child resides or has been left is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child, the whereabouts of the parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate the parent have been unsuccessful.
(h) The child has been freed for adoption by one or both parents for 12 months by either relinquishment or termination of parental rights or an adoption petition has not been granted.
(i) The child has been subjected to an act or acts of cruelty by the parent or guardian or a member of his or her household, or the parent or guardian has failed to adequately protect the child from an act or acts of cruelty when the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that the child was in danger of being subjected to an act or acts of cruelty.
(j) The child’s sibling has been abused or neglected, as defined in subdivision (a), (b), (d), (e), or (i), and there is a substantial risk that the child will be abused or neglected, as defined in those subdivisions. The court shall consider the circumstances surrounding the abuse or neglect of the sibling, the age and gender of each child, the nature of the abuse or neglect of the sibling, the mental condition of the parent or guardian, and any other factors the court considers probative in determining whether there is a substantial risk to the child.
It is the intent of the Legislature that this section not disrupt the family unnecessarily or intrude inappropriately into family life, prohibit the use of reasonable methods of parental discipline, or prescribe a particular method of parenting. Further, this section is not intended to limit the offering of voluntary services to those families in need of assistance but who do not come within the descriptions of this section. To the extent that savings accrue to the state from child welfare services funding obtained as a result of the enactment of the act that enacted this section, those savings shall be used to promote services which support family maintenance and family reunification plans, such as client transportation, out-of-home respite care, parenting training, and the provision of temporary or emergency in-home caretakers and persons teaching and demonstrating homemaking skills. The Legislature further declares that a physical disability, such as blindness or deafness, is no bar to the raising of happy and well-adjusted children and that a court’s determination pursuant to this section shall center upon whether a parent’s disability prevents him or her from exercising care and control. The Legislature further declares that a child whose parent has been adjudged a dependent child of the court pursuant to this section shall not be considered to be at risk of abuse or neglect solely because of the age, dependent status, or foster care status of the parent.
As used in this section, “guardian” means the legal guardian of the child.
SECTION 1.
Section 602 of the
Welfare and Institutions Code
is amended to read:
602.
(a)Except as provided in subdivision (b), any person who is under 18 years of age when he or she violates any law of this state or of the United States or any ordinance of any city or county of this state defining crime, other than an ordinance establishing a curfew based solely on age, is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge that person to be a ward of the court.
(b)Any person who is alleged, when he or she was 14 years of age or older, to have committed one of the following offenses shall be prosecuted under the general law in a court of criminal jurisdiction:
(1)Murder, as described in Section 187 of the Penal Code, if one of the circumstances enumerated in subdivision (a) of Section 190.2 of the Penal Code is alleged by the prosecutor, and the prosecutor alleges that the minor personally killed the victim.
(2)The following sex offenses, if the prosecutor alleges that the minor personally committed the offense and alleges that one of the circumstances enumerated in subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 667.61 of the Penal Code applies:
(A)Rape, as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261 of the Penal Code.
(B)Spousal rape, as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 262 of the Penal Code.
(C)Forcible sex offenses in concert with another, as described in Section 264.1 of the Penal Code.
(D)Forcible lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14 years of age, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 288 of the Penal Code.
(E)Forcible sexual penetration, as described in subdivision (a) of Section 289 of the Penal Code.
(F)Sodomy or oral copulation in violation of Section 286 or 288a of the Penal Code, by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person.
(G)Lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14 years of age, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 288, unless the defendant qualifies for probation under subdivision (d) of Section 1203.066 of the Penal Code.","Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge certain children to be dependents of the court under certain circumstances, including when the child is abused, a parent or guardian fails to adequately supervise or protect the child, as specified, or a parent or guardian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment. Existing law declares that a child is within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child is a victim of sexual trafficking, or receives food, shelter, or money in exchange for specified sexual acts, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to protect the child, and declares that this is declaratory of existing law.
This bill would additionally include a child within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child solicits or engages in any act of prostitution or loiters in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, and the child’s parent or guardian has failed to protect the child. The bill would state that these provisions are declaratory of existing law.
The Arnold-Kennick Juvenile Court Law provides that any person who is under 18 years of age when he or she violates any criminal law while in this state, except an age curfew ordinance or any other specified offense, comes within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge the person a ward of the court.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.","An act to amend Section
602

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Food is the single most prevalent item in California’s waste stream, with over 5.5 million tons of food dumped in landfills every year in the state.
(b) Four percent of the total energy budget, about 12 percent of the land, and 23 percent of all freshwater consumed in the United States is used to grow food that goes uneaten.
(c) Discarded food is a drain on our economy, costing consumers and industry $162 billion each year nationally.
(d) Reducing food losses by just 15 percent would be equivalent to enough food to feed more than 25 million Americans every year. According to estimates, more than 6 million Californians, including one in four children, suffer from food insecurity.
(e) Dumping uneaten food and other organic waste into landfills releases more than 8.3 million tons of greenhouse gases each year in California, contributing 20 percent of the state’s methane emissions.
(f) Misinterpretation of the date labels on foods is a key factor leading to food waste in American households, and surveys show that 56 to 90 percent of consumers discard food prematurely as a result of misinterpreting food date labels.
(g) It is the public policy of this state that consumers benefit from uniform and accurate expiration date labeling.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Heavy container corridors connect the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to warehouses and distribution centers throughout the port area.
(b)
These corridors allow port customers to move certain types of heavy cargo, such as agricultural goods, and from the port complex, which enhance the competitiveness of the two ports.
(c)
These specially designated corridors include streets located in the Cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Carson, as well as California state routes. Overweight trucks that have a gross vehicle weight in excess of 80,000 pounds, but no more than 95,000 pounds, are allowed to operate on heavy container corridors upon issuance of permits from their respective jurisdictions.
(d)
The Cities of Long Beach and Carson share a common method of determining whether a truck is overweight while traversing heavy container corridors. However, the City of Los Angeles currently uses a different method of determining whether a truck is overweight.
(e)
This difference causes confusion, results in users of the heavy container corridors in the City of Los Angeles to incur fines and penalties, and incentivizes noncompliance with safety measures required on the corridors.
(f)
It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act that the Cities of Los Angeles, Carson, and Long Beach all utilize the same methodology to enforce the weight limits established by permits issued by the Department of Transportation for trucks traveling along heavy container corridors.

35700.5.
(a) The Department of Transportation, upon adoption of an ordinance or resolution that is in conformance with the provisions of this section by the City of Carson, the City of Long Beach, and the City of Los Angeles, covering designated routes, may issue a special permit to the operator of a vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment, permitting the operation and movement of the vehicle, combination, or equipment, and its load, on the 3.66-mile portion of State Route 47 and State Route 103 known as the Terminal Island Freeway, between Willow Street in the City of Long Beach and Terminal Island in the City of Long Beach and the City of Los Angeles, and on the 2.4-mile portion of State Highway Route 1, that is between Sanford Avenue in the City of Los Angeles and Harbor Avenue in the City of Long Beach, if the vehicle, combination, or equipment meets all of the following criteria:
(1) The vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment is used to transport intermodal cargo containers that are moving in international commerce.
(2) The vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment, in combination with its load, has a maximum gross weight in excess of the maximum gross weight limit of vehicles and loads specified in this chapter, but does not exceed 95,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.
(3) (A) The vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment conforms to the axle weight limits specified in Section 35550.
(B) The vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment conforms to the axle weight limits in Section 35551, except as specified in subparagraph (C).
(C) Vehicles, combinations of vehicles, or mobile equipment that impose more than 80,000 pounds total gross weight on the highway by any group of two or more consecutive axles, exceed 60 feet in length between the extremes of any group of two or more consecutive axles, or have more than six axles shall conform to weight limits that shall be determined by the Department of Transportation.
(b) The permit issued by the Department of Transportation shall be required to authorize the operation or movement of a vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment described in subdivision (a). The permit shall not authorize the movement of hazardous materials or hazardous wastes, as those terms are defined by local, state, and federal law. The following criteria shall be included in the application for the permit:
(1) A description of the loads and vehicles to be operated under the permit.
(2) An agreement wherein each applicant agrees to be responsible for all injuries to persons and for all damage to real or personal property of the state and others directly caused by or resulting from the operation of the applicant’s vehicles or combination of vehicles under the conditions of the permit. The applicant shall agree to hold harmless and indemnify the state and all its agents for all costs or claims arising out of or caused by the movement of vehicles or combination of vehicles under the conditions of the permit.
(3) The applicant shall provide proof of financial responsibility that covers the movement of the shipment as described in subdivision (a). The insurance shall meet the minimum requirements established by law.
(4) An agreement to carry a copy of the permit in the vehicle at all times and furnish the copy upon request of an employee of the Department of the California Highway Patrol or the Department of Transportation.
(5) An agreement to place an indicia, developed by the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of the California Highway Patrol, upon the vehicle identifying it as a vehicle possibly operating under this section. The indicia shall be displayed in the lower right area of the front windshield of the power unit. The Department of Transportation may charge a fee to cover the cost of producing and issuing this indicia.
(c) The permit issued pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be valid for one year. The permit may be canceled by the Department of Transportation for any of the following reasons:
(1) The failure of the applicant to maintain any of the conditions required pursuant to subdivision (b).
(2) The failure of the applicant to maintain a satisfactory rating, as required by Section 34501.12.
(3) A determination by the Department of Transportation that there is sufficient cause to cancel the permit because the continued movement of the applicant’s vehicles under the permit would jeopardize the safety of the motorists on the roadway or result in undue damage to the highways listed in this section.
(d) This section does not authorize an applicant or holder of a special permit under subdivision (a) to operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles in excess of the maximum gross weight limit of vehicles and loads specified in this chapter outside of the designated corridors identified in subdivision (a). A violation of this subdivision shall result in the revocation of the permit.
(e) The Department of Transportation may charge a fee to cover the cost of issuing a permit pursuant to subdivision (a).

if
the City of Carson, the City of Long Beach, and the City of Los Angeles
adopt an ordinance or resolution, as described in subdivision (a), the ordinance or resolution shall conform with the weight limits determined by the Department of Transportation pursuant to this section.
shall use and enforce the axle and gross vehicle weight limits used by the Department of Transportation for a permitted vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment operating or moving on a route described in subdivision (a) by individual, and not combined, axle group calculations.","Existing law authorizes the Department of Transportation, upon adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the City of Carson, the City of Long Beach, and the City of Los Angeles, to issue a special permit to the operator of a vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment, permitting the operation and movement of the vehicle, combination, or equipment, and its load, on specified routes in those cities if the vehicle, combination, or equipment meets specified criteria. Under existing law, those criteria include that the vehicle, combination of vehicles, or mobile equipment is used to transport intermodal cargo containers that are moving in international commerce, and that the maximum gross weight of the vehicles and loads not exceed 95,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.

1191,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that having a healthy housing market that provides an adequate supply of homes affordable to Californians at all income levels is critical to the economic prosperity and quality of life in the state.
(b) The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Funding approved by the state’s voters in 2002 and 2006, as of June 2014, has financed the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of over 14,000 shelter spaces and 149,000 affordable homes. These numbers include thousands of supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness. In addition, these funds have helped tens of thousands of families become or remain homeowners. Nearly all of the voter-approved funding for affordable housing was awarded by the beginning of 2016.
(2) The requirement in the Community Redevelopment Law that redevelopment agencies set aside 20 percent of tax increment for affordable housing generated roughly $1 billion per year. With the elimination of redevelopment agencies, this funding stream has disappeared.
(3) In 2014, the Legislature committed 10 percent of ongoing cap-and-trade funds for affordable housing that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dedicated $100 million in one-time funding for affordable multifamily and permanent supportive housing. In addition, the people of California thoughtfully approved the repurposing of $600 million in already committed bond funds for the creation of affordable rental and permanent supportive housing for veterans through the passage of Proposition 41.
(4) Despite these investments, the need in the State of California greatly exceeds the available resources, with recent data showing 36.2 percent of mortgaged homeowners and 47.7 percent of all renters are spending more than 35 percent of their household incomes on housing.
(5) California has 12 percent of the United States population, but 20 percent of its homeless population. California has the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless in the nation, with 63 percent of homeless Californians not having shelter. California has 24 percent of the nation’s homeless veteran’s population and one-third of the nations’ chronically homeless population. California also has the largest populations of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, with 30 percent of the national total.
(6) Furthermore, four of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the country with the highest rate of homelessness are in the following metropolitan areas in California: San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, Fresno, and Stockton.
(7) California continues to have the second lowest homeownership rate in the nation, and the Los Angeles metropolitan area is now a majority renter area. In fact, five of the eight lowest homeownership rates are in metropolitan areas in California.
(8) Los Angeles and Orange Counties have been identified as the epicenter of overcrowded housing, and numerous studies have shown that children in crowded homes have poorer health, worse scores on mathematics and reading tests, and higher rates of depression and behavioral problems—even when poverty is taken into account.
(9) Millions of Californians are affected by the state’s chronic housing shortage, including seniors, veterans, people experiencing chronic homelessness, working families, people with mental, physical, or developmental disabilities, agricultural workers, people exiting jails, prisons, and other state institutions, survivors of domestic violence, and former foster and transition-aged youth.
(10) Eight of the top 10 hardest hit cities by the foreclosure crisis in the nation were in California. They include the Cities of Stockton, Modesto, Vallejo, Riverside, San Bernardino, Merced, Bakersfield, and Sacramento.
(11) California’s workforce continues to experience longer commute times as persons in the workforce seek affordable housing outside the areas in which they work. If California is unable to support the construction of affordable housing in these areas, congestion problems will strain the state’s transportation system and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions.
(12) Many economists agree that the state’s higher than average unemployment rate is due in large part to massive shrinkage in the construction industry from 2005 to 2009, inclusive, including losses of nearly 700,000 construction-related jobs, a 60-percent decline in construction spending, and an 83-percent reduction in residential permits. Restoration of a healthy construction sector will significantly reduce the state’s unemployment rate.
(13) The lack of sufficient housing impedes economic growth and development by making it difficult for California employers to attract and retain employees.

Any such partial or interim payment or reimbursement shall not be conditioned upon the recipient’s agreement to release the polluter from liability for any current or future claim.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a payment or reimbursement made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter to any recipient may be credited against the liability of the polluter, agent, or entity to the recipient for any current or future claim that is related to the environmental disaster.
(c) A temporary or final settlement of any kind made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter, to any claimant, shall release the responsible polluter, agent, or entity from liability to the claimant only for acts, omissions, or injuries that are believed by the claimant to have occurred prior to the date of the settlement, and shall not release any claim that is unknown to the claimant at the time of the settlement, occurs subsequent to the settlement, or that is unrelated to the environmental disaster.
(d) Any agreement in violation of subdivision (a) or (c) that is entered into on or after February 1, 2017, is void as a matter of law and against public policy.
(e) For purposes of this section, a “partial or interim payment or reimbursement” is a payment of the recipient’s immediate out-of-pocket expenses, including, but not limited to, food, clothing, and shelter.
(f) The provisions of this section shall only apply to an agreement relating to acts, omissions, or injuries in connection with an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company’s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon.
(g) This section shall not apply to any action against a public entity as defined in Section 811.2 of the Government Code.

Section 340.85 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure, immediately following Section 340.8, to read:
340.85.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 340.8, in any civil action for injury or illness based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance, the time for commencement of the action shall be no later than either three years from the date of injury, or three years after the plaintiff becomes aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, (1) an injury, (2) the physical cause of the injury, and (3) sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 340.8, in an action for the wrongful death of any plaintiff’s decedent, based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance, the time for commencement of an action shall be no later than either (1) three years from the date of the death of the plaintiff’s decedent, or (2) three years from the first date on which the plaintiff is aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, the physical cause of the death and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) A “civil action for injury or illness based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance” does not include an action subject to Section 340.2 or 340.5.
(2) Media reports regarding the hazardous material or toxic substance contamination do not, in and of themselves, constitute sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury or death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another.
(d) The provisions of this section shall only apply to an action relating to exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance in connection with an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company’s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon.
(e) This section shall not apply to any action against a public entity as defined in Section 811.2 of the Government Code.
SEC. 3.
Section 1021.3 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure, to read:
1021.3.

SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution to achieve just and efficient results in civil litigation involving the unique circumstances of damages resulting from specific environmental disasters within the state.","(1) Existing law provides that an obligation is extinguished by a release given to the debtor by the creditor, upon a new consideration, or in writing, with or without new consideration. A general release does not extend to claims the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.
Under this bill, a partial or interim payment or reimbursement, made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter to any recipient, would not release the polluter from liability to the recipient for any claim related to the environmental disaster or for any future claim by the recipient against the polluter, or for both current and future claims. The bill would prohibit any such partial or interim payment or reimbursement from being conditioned upon the recipient’s agreement to release the polluter from liability for any current or future claim. The bill would allow such a payment or reimbursement to any recipient to be credited against the liability of the polluter, agent, or entity to the recipient for any current or future claim that is related to the environmental disaster.
Under the bill, a temporary or final settlement of any kind made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter, to any claimant, would release the responsible polluter, agent, or entity from liability to the claimant only for acts, omissions, or injuries that are believed by the claimant to have occurred prior to the date of the settlement, and would not release any claim that is unknown to the claimant at the time of the settlement, occurs subsequent to the settlement, or that is unrelated to the environmental disaster.
The bill would make any agreement in violation of those prohibitions that is entered into on or after February 1, 2017, void as a matter of law and against public policy.
(2) Existing law establishes statutes of limitations for civil actions for injury or illness or wrongful death based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance other than asbestos, as specified. For injury or illness, the statute of limitations is 2 years from the date of injury, or 2 years after the plaintiff becomes aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, an injury, the physical cause of the injury, and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later. For wrongful death, the statute of limitations is no later than either 2 years from the date of the death of the plaintiff’s decedent, or 2 years from the first date on which the plaintiff is aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, the physical cause of the death and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.
This bill would, notwithstanding the above provision, establish a statute of limitations of 3 years for specified civil actions for injury, illness, or wrongful death based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance other than asbestos.
(3) Under existing law, except as attorneys’ fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys is left to the agreement of the parties.
This bill would authorize the court, in any action for private nuisance against an environmental polluter defendant arising out of an environmental disaster for which the defendant has been adjudged civilly liable, upon motion, to award reasonable attorneys’ fees to a prevailing plaintiff against the defendant.
(4) This bill would limit the application of its provisions to damages caused by an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company’s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, as specified, or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon. The bill would specify that its provisions do not apply to any action against a public entity, as defined.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for these regions.","An act to add Section 1544 to the Civil Code, and to add Sections 340.85 and 1021.3 to the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to environmental disaster."

(v) The allograft tissue is registered with the FDA and designated to be maintained at ambient room temperature requiring no refrigeration.","Existing federal law governs the processing, storage, and use of human tissue and human cell, tissue, or cellular- or tissue-based products (HCT/P), as specified, and imposes certain regulatory duties relating to HCT/P upon the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Existing state law requires the State Department of Public Health to license and regulate tissue banks, which process, store, or distribute human tissue for transplantation into human beings. Existing law generally requires every tissue bank operating in this state to have a current and valid tissue bank license issued or renewed by the department, but exempts certain activities from that requirement, including the storage of HCT/P by a licensed physician or podiatrist, as specified, if the products were obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, stored in strict accordance with manufacturer instructions, and used solely for the express purpose of direct implantation into or application on the practitioner’s own patient, among other criteria.
This bill would create an additional exemption from the tissue bank licensing requirement for the storage of allograft tissue by a person if that person is a hospital or outpatient setting, the person maintains a log including specified information pertaining to the allograft tissue, and the allograft tissue meets specified requirements, including, among other things, that the allograft tissue was obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, is individually boxed and labeled with a unique identification number and expiration date, and is intended for the express purpose of implantation into or application on a patient.","An act to amend Section 1635.1 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to tissue banks."

(d) The Secretary of State may move the court at any time to dismiss the petition when it appears there are no triable issues and the petition is without merit.

(b) When multiple corporations or their agents are involved in the same event or series of events that are the basis of the claimant’s final judgment and the conduct of two or more of the corporations or their agents results in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, the claimant may seek recovery from the fund based on the judgment against any one of the corporations or their agents, subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).
(c) When multiple claimants are involved in a corporate fraud, or in misrepresentation or deceit by a corporation or its agents, resulting in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, each claimant may seek recovery from the fund individually, subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).

SEC. 10.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law establishes the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, within the State Treasury administered by the Secretary of State, the sole purpose of which is to provide restitution to victims of corporate fraud. Existing law provides that an aggrieved person who obtains a final judgment, as specified, against a corporation based upon the corporation’s fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, made with intent to defraud, may file an application with the Secretary of State for payment from the fund for the amount unpaid on the judgment that represents the awarded actual and direct loss to the claimant in the final judgment.
This bill would additionally apply those provisions if an aggrieved person obtains a criminal restitution order against an agent, as defined, of a corporation based upon those same circumstances. The bill would also make conforming changes. By allowing for additional payments to be made from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law requires the application filed with the Secretary of State to include specified information and documentation, and imposes criminal penalties for the filing of any documents that are false or untrue or contain any willful, material misstatements of fact.
This bill would require, if the final judgment is a criminal restitution order, the claimant to provide the charging document and the restitution order, and if the defendant is an agent, documentation showing the defendant named in the restitution order is an agent as defined in this bill. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires, if, at any time, the money deposited in the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized award or offer of settlement, the Secretary of State to, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund, satisfy the unpaid award or offer of settlement, plus specified accumulated interest.
This bill would eliminate the requirement to pay that specified accumulated interest.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 2281, 2282, 2282.1, 2286, 2288, 2289, 2290, 2293.1, and 2294 of the Corporations Code, relating to fraud, and making an appropriation therefor."

1198,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Commute patterns throughout northern California, and in particular through the Altamont Pass corridor, traverse the boundaries of traditional metropolitan planning agencies. The Altamont Pass corridor, located in the center of northern California’s megaregion, is the gateway to the Tri—Valley—a vital node in the bay area’s economic ecosystem and a key bay area transportation route. Strategic and planned interregional mobility is essential to sustained economic vitality.
(b) Connecting the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in Livermore, as recommended by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s regional rail plan, would increase interregional mobility, providing much-needed highway capacity for expanded goods movement to the bay area’s five seaports. It would also relieve pressure on Interstate 580 and other transportation systems, given the exponential population growth in the central valley.
(c) The Bay Area Rapid Transit District has stated its priority is to operate and maintain its existing core commuter rail system; expansion is not a priority for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Recent rail expansions in other parts of the state have been successfully implemented by single purpose agencies such as the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority.
(d) The Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority is needed to connect the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in Tri-Valley and would be responsive to local needs and issues by including local stakeholders in land use and transit planning decisions.
(e) Consistent with the Bay Area Regional Rail Plan adopted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (Resolution 3826), the heavy rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express is a matter of state interest, and all planning, analysis, alternatives, and mitigations for projects undertaken by the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority should be consistent with that state interest.
SEC. 2.
It is the intent of the Legislature to establish the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority to plan and deliver a cost effective and responsive rail extension that connects the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore, to address regional economic and transportation challenges.

SECTION 1.
Section 30814 of the
Streets and Highways Code
is amended to read:
30814.
(a)No toll shall be imposed on the passage of a pedestrian or bicycle over any bridge that is part of the state highway system, on which the travel of pedestrians and bicycles is otherwise authorized, and on which tolls are imposed on the passage of motor vehicles, including any bridge constructed pursuant to a franchise granted under this article.
(b)This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2022, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2022, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law provides for the creation of statewide and local transportation agencies, which may be established as joint powers authorities or established expressly by statute. Existing law establishes the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which is authorized to acquire, construct, own, operate, control, or use rights-of-way, rail lines, bus lines, stations, platforms, switches, yards, terminals, parking lots, and any and all other facilities necessary or convenient for rapid transit service.
This bill would establish the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning and delivering a cost effective and responsive interregional rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore, that meets the goals and objectives of the community. The bill would require the authority’s governing board to be composed of 12 representatives and would authorize the authority to appoint an executive who may appoint staff or retain consultants. The bill would provide specified authorizations and duties to the authority.
This bill would require all unencumbered moneys dedicated for the completion of the connection to be transferred to the authority. The bill would require the Bay Area Rapid Transit District to assume ownership of all physical improvements, and to assume operational control, maintenance responsibilities, and related financial obligations for the connection, upon its completion. The bill would require the Department of Transportation to expedite reviews and requests related to the connection. The bill would require the authority to provide a project update report to the public, to be posted on the authority’s Internet Web site, on the development and implementation of the connection.
By imposing new duties on local governmental entities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing law, until January 1, 2021, prohibits a toll from being imposed on the passage of a pedestrian or bicycle over any bridge that is part of the state highway system, as specified.
This bill would extend that prohibition until January 1, 2022.","An act to amend Section 30814 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation.
An act to add Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 132651) to Division 12.7 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to transportation."
1199,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1170.18 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1170.18.
(a) A person who, on November 5, 2014, was serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (“this act”) had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with Sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code, or Section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the Penal Code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act.
(b) Upon receiving a petition under subdivision (a), the court shall determine whether the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a). If the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a), the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor pursuant to Sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code, or Section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the Penal Code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act, unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. In exercising its discretion, the court may consider all of the following:
(1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes.
(2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated.
(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.
(c) As used throughout this Code, “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.
(d) A person who is resentenced pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be given credit for time served and shall be subject to parole for one year following completion of his or her sentence, unless the court, in its discretion, as part of its resentencing order, releases the person from parole. Such person is subject to Section 3000.08 parole supervision by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the jurisdiction of the court in the county in which the parolee is released or resides, or in which an alleged violation of supervision has occurred, for the purpose of hearing petitions to revoke parole and impose a term of custody.
(e) Under no circumstances may resentencing under this section result in the imposition of a term longer than the original sentence.
(f) A person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.
(g) If the application satisfies the criteria in subdivision (f ), the court shall designate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.
(h) Unless requested by the applicant, no hearing is necessary to grant or deny an application filed under subsection (f ).
(i) The provisions of this section shall not apply to persons who have one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 290.
(j) Any petition or application under this section shall be filed on or before November 4, 2022, or at a later date upon showing of good cause.
(k) Any felony conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 29800) of Division 9 of Title 4 of Part 6.
(l) If the court that originally sentenced the petitioner is not available, the presiding judge shall designate another judge to rule on the petition or application.
(m) Nothing in this section is intended to diminish or abrogate any rights or remedies otherwise available to the petitioner or applicant.
(n) Nothing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act.
(o) A resentencing hearing ordered under this act shall constitute a “post‑conviction release proceeding” under paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution (Marsy’s Law).","Existing law, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted by Proposition 47, as approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, reduced the penalties for various crimes. Under the provisions of the act, a person currently convicted of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act if the act had been in effect at the time of the conviction may petition or apply to have the sentence reduced in accordance with the act. That act requires that this petition or application be filed before November 4, 2017, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause.
Proposition 47 authorizes its provisions to be amended by a statute that is consistent with and furthers its intent and that is passed by a
2/3
vote of each house of the Legislature and is signed by the Governor. Proposition 47 also provides that the Legislature may, by majority vote, amend, add, or repeal provisions to further reduce the penalties for offenses it addresses.
This bill would instead authorize a person to petition or apply for a reduction of sentence before November 4, 2022, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause. Because the bill would extend the period of time in which a person could file a petition or application without a showing of good cause, the bill would amend the act and would require a
2/3
vote of the Legislature.","An act to amend Section 1170.18 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing."
