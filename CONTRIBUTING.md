## Guidelines

PRs to this repo are subject to review by the Azure Machine Learning team.

### Rules

* minimal prose
* minimalist code
* no azureml-* in training code
* examples (including notebooks) can be re-run without failing in less than 10 minutes
* tutorials must be re-run without failing at least daily
* `pip install --upgrade -r requirements` remains <60s

### Checks

To ensure all checks are passed:

* run `python readme.py` from the root of the repo to generate the README.md, `run-examples` and `run-notebooks` workflow files, and code formatting

### Organization

* `examples` is for general examples using AML
* `notebooks` is for general example notebooks using AML
* `tutorials` is for end to end tutorials using AML

### Naming conventions

Naming conventions are still in flux. Currently:

* under `examples`, naming should be logical
* under `notebooks`, the naming convention *scenario-framework-etc-compute* , where *scenario* is one of ["train", "deploy", "score", "dprep"]
* directories under `tutorials` should be words separated by hyphens
* workflows for tutorials use the naming convention `run-tutorial-*initials*`, where *initials* is the initials of the words

### Testing

* `run-examples` runs on every push and PR to `main` and runs all examples under `examples/`
* `run-notebooks` runs on every push and PR to `main` and runs all examples under `notebooks/`
* `tutorials` must be tested at least daily
* `cleanup` runs daily and cleans up AML resources for the testing workspace
