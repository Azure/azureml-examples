## Guidelines

PRs to this repo are subject to review by the Azure ML team.

### Rules

* minimal prose
* minimalist code
* no azureml-* code in training scripts
* notebooks can be re-run without failing in less than 10 minutes
* if adding new requirements, pip install time must remain <60s

### Checks

To ensure all checks are passed:

* run `python readme.py` from the root of the repo to generate the README.md, workflow files, and run formatting

### Organization

* `notebooks` is for general example notebooks using AML
* `tutorials` is for end to end tutorials using AML
* `concepts` is for API example notebooks of core AML concepts

### Naming conventions

Naming conventions are still under consideration. For notebooks under `notebooks`, the notebook filename must start with "train" or "deploy".

### Testing

* `run-notebooks` runs on every push and runs all notebooks under `notebooks` and `concepts`
* `cleanup` runs daily and cleans up AML resources for the testing workspace
