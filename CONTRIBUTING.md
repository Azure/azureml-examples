## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## Principle

There should be one - and preferably only one - [obvious](https://pep20.org/#obvious) way to do it.

## Spirit of azureml-examples

Per the above principle, this repo is an opinionated set of examples using a subset of Azure Machine Learning. This entails:

- frequent and comprehensive testing
- clear separation of cloud code (job definition) and user code
- structure for developing the full ML lifecycle (on GitHub)

## Issues

All forms of feedback are welcome through issues - please follow the pre-defined templates where applicable.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) to this repo require review and approval by the Azure Machine Learning (AML) team to merge. Please follow the pre-defined template and read all relevant sections below.

> **Important:**
> PRs from forks of this repository are likely to fail automated workflows due to access to secrets. PRs from forks will be considered but may experience additional delay for testing.

### General rules

- minimal prose
- minimalist code
- workflows and notebooks can be re-run without failing in less than 10 minutes
- tutorials can re-run without failing in less than 3 hours

### Miscellaneous

- to modify `README.md`, you need to modify `readme.py` and accompanying markdown files
- the tables in the `README.md` are auto-generated, including description, via other files
- develop on a branch, not a fork, for workflows to run properly
- use an existing environment where possible
- use an existing dataset where possible
- don't register environments
- don't create compute targets
- don't modify `requirements.txt`
- you probably shouldn't modify any files in the root of the repo
- you can `!pip install --upgrade packages` as needed in notebooks
- you can (and likely should) abstract setup for tutorials in a `setup.sh` file or similar

### Modifying an existing example

If modifying existing examples, before a PR:

- run `python readme.py` from the root of the repo
- this will generate the `README.md` file
- this will generate the `run-workflows` and `run-notebooks` workflow files
- this will format Python code and notebooks

### Enforced naming

Directories and files must follow:

- naming must be logical
- directories under `tutorials` must be words separated by hyphens
- tutorial workflows (and workflow files) use the naming convention `run-tutorial-*initials*`, where *initials* is the initials of the words

### Unenforced naming

- `environment_name` = "framework-example|tutorial" e.g. "pytorch-example"
- `experiment_name` = "logical-words-example|tutorial" e.g. "hello-world-tutorial"
- `compute_name` = "compute-defined-in-setup-workspace.py" e.g. "gpu-K80-2"
- `ws = Workspace.from_config()`
- `dstore = ws.get_default_datastore()`
- `ds = Dataset.File.from_files(...)`
- `env = Environment.from_*(...)`
- `src = ScriptRunConfig(...)`
- `run = Experiment(ws, experiment_name).submit(src)`

### Adding a new ________?

Thinking of contributing a new example? Read this first!

#### Tutorials

A tutorial is an end-to-end example accomplishing something significant or teaching how to scale up and out in the cloud. A tutorial **must** have an excellent `README.md` file in its directory, following conventional markdown syntax, explaining:

- required prerequisites
- any one-time setup needed by the user
- any other setup instructions
- overview of files in the tutorial
- relevant links

Tutorials are often, but not required to be, a series of ordered Jupyter notebooks. All Jupyter notebooks must utilize notebook features (i.e. be interactive, have explanation in markdown cells, etc).

**You should probably ask (open an issue) before contributing a new tutorial.** Currently, themes for tutorials include:

- `using-*` for learning ML tooling basics and tracking/scaling in the cloud
- `work-with-*` for integrations with cloud tooling, e.g. `work-with-databricks`, `work-with-synapse`
- `deploy-*` for advanced deployment scenarios
- `automl-with-*` for automated ML tutorials

#### Notebooks

A notebook is an example accomplishing something significant in a Jupyter notebook, often written in Python. To qualify to be a notebook, the example must:

- obviously benefit from being a Jupyter notebook

Some examples of this include:

- connecting and interactively querying common data sources (SQL, ADLS, etc)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Exploratory Data Science (EDS)
- iterative experimentation with cloud tracking

Anything else should likely be a regular example.

#### Workflows

A workflow specifies the job(s) to be run. Currently, scenarios include:

- `train`
- `dataprep`
- `deploy`
- `score`

#### Adding a new workflow

A workflow consists of the workflow definition, currently written as a Python script, and user code, which is often Python.

Checklist:

- [ ] add job definition under `workflows/`
- [ ] add user code, preserving any licensing information, under `code/`
- [ ] run `readme.py`
- [ ] test
- [ ] submit PR, which will run `run-workflow`

#### Adding a new notebook

A notebook is a self-contained example written as a `.ipynb` file.

Checklist:

- [ ] add notebook with description to `notebooks/`
- [ ] run `readme.py`
- [ ] test
- [ ] submit PR, which will run `run-notebooks`

#### Adding a new tutorial

Tutorials must include frequent automated testing through GitHub Actions. One time setup for Azure resources and anything else a user needs must be written in the `README.md`. An AML team member with access to the testing resource group will follow the `README.md` to perform the required setup, and then rerun your tutorial workflow which should now pass.

Checklist:

- [ ] add the tutorial directory under `tutorials/`, following naming conventions
- [ ] add tutorial files, which are usually notebooks and may be ordered
- [ ] add `README.md` in the tutorial directory with a description (see other tutorials for format)
- [ ] add `run-tutorial-initials`, where *initials* are the initials of the description directory (see other tutorial workflows)
- [ ] run `readme.py`
- [ ] test
- [ ] submit PR, which will run your tutorial if setup properly
