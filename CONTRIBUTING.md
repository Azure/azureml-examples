## Guidelines

Pull requests (PRs) to this repo require review and approval by the Azure Machine Learning (AML) team to merge.

> **Important:**
> PRs from forks of this repository are likely to fail automated workflows due to access to secrets. PRs from forks will be considered but may experience additional delay for testing.

### Rules

* minimal prose
* minimalist code
* no azureml-* in training code
* examples (including notebooks) can be re-run without failing in less than 10 minutes
* tutorials must be re-run without failing at least daily
* `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` remains <60s

### Checks

Before submitting a PR:

* run `python readme.py` from the root of the repo
* this will generate the `README.md` file
* this will generate the `run-examples` and `run-notebooks` workflow files
* this will format Python code and notebooks

### Organization

PRs to add new examples should consider which type of example to add:

* `examples` is for general examples using AML and should run `code` examples
* `notebooks` is for general example notebooks using AML and should be interactive
* `tutorials` is for end to end tutorials using AML

### Enforced naming

PRs must follow the following naming conventions:

* naming must be logical
* under `notebooks` use the naming convention *scenario-framework-etc-compute* , where *scenario* is one of ["train", "deploy", "score", "dprep"]
* directories under `tutorials` must be words separated by hyphens
* tutorial workflows use the naming convention `run-tutorial-*initials*`, where *initials* is the initials of the words

### Testing

PRs must include necessary changes to any testing to ensure:

* `run-examples` runs on every push and PR to `main` (with changes to examples) and runs all examples under `examples/`
* `run-notebooks` runs on every push and PR to `main` (with changes to notebooks) and runs all examples under `notebooks/`
* a tutorial must be tested at least daily and on PR to `main` (with changes to the tutorial)
* `cleanup` runs daily and cleans up AML resources for the testing workspace

### Miscellaneous

* to modify `README.md`, you need to modify `readme.py` and accompanying markdown files
* the tables in the `README.md` are auto-generated, including description, via other files
* develop on a branch, not a fork, for workflows to run properly
* use an existing environment where possible
* use an existing dataset where possible
* don't register environments
* don't create compute targets
* don't modify `requirements.txt`
* you probably shouldn't modify any files in the root of the repo
* you can `!pip install --upgrade packages` as needed in notebooks

#### Unenforced naming

* `environment_name` = "framework-example|tutorial" e.g. "pytorch-example"
* `experiment_name` = "logical-words-example|tutorial" e.g. "hello-world-tutorial"
* `compute_name` = "compute-defined-in-setup.py" e.g. "gpu-K80-2"
* `ws = Workspace.from_config()`
* `dstore = ws.get_default_datastore()`
* `ds = Dataset.File.from_files(...)`
* `env = Environment.from_*(...)`
* `src = ScriptRunConfig(...)`
* `run = Experiment(ws, experiment_name).submit(src)`

#### Adding a new example

An example consists of the control plane definition, currently written as a Python script, and user code, which is often Python.

Checklist:

* [ ] add control plane code with description under `examples/`
* [ ] add ML code, preserving any licensing information in the code, to `code/`
* [ ] test locally (need to create the same compute target)
* [ ] run `readme.py`
* [ ] submit PR, which will run `run-examples`

#### Adding a new notebook

A notebook is a self-contained (read: no dependency on `code/`) example written as a `.ipynb` file.

Checklist:

* [ ] is it interactive?
* [ ] does it need to be a notebook?
* [ ] are you sure? why?
* [ ] add notebook with description to `notebooks/`
* [ ] run `readme.py`
* [ ] submit PR, which will run `run-notebooks`

#### Adding a new tutorial

Tutorials must include frequent automated testing through GitHub Actions. One time setup for Azure resources and anything else a user needs must be written in the `README.md`. An AML team member with access to the testing resource group will follow the `README.md` to perform the required setup, and then rerun your tutorial workflow which should now pass.

If it is a simple ML training example, it does not need to be a tutorial. Current themes for tutorials include:

* `using-*` for tutorials on ML frameworks
* `deploy-*` for advanced deployment scenarios
* `work-with-*` for Azure integrations
* `automl-with-*` for automated ML frameworks

Checklist:

* [ ] add the tutorial directory under `tutorials/`, following naming conventions
* [ ] add tutorial files, which are usually notebooks and may be ordered
* [ ] add `README.md` in the tutorial directory with a description (see other tutorials for format)
* [ ] add `run-tutorial-initials`, where *initials* are the initials of the description directory (see other tutorial workflows)
* [ ] run `readme.py`
* [ ] submit PR, which will run your tutorial if setup properly
