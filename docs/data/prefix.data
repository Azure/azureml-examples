Welcome to the AML examples!

## Installation

Clone this repository and install required packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
cd azureml-examples
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

To create or setup a workspace with the assets used in these examples, run the [setup script](setup.py).

> If you already have an Azure ML Workspace, running `python setup.py` will load it from the config file and create various AML compute clusters in the workspace. By default, all clusters will have `min_nodes=0` and will autoscale back to 0 nodes after 20 minutes idle. Some examples use AKS or speciality AML compute targets, which can be created by running `python setup.ipynb --create-aks True --create-V100 True`.

## Python Notebooks

End to end tutorials can be found in the [tutorials directory](tutorials). The main example notebooks are located in the [notebooks directory](notebooks). Notebooks overviewing the Python SDK for key concepts in AML can be found in the [concepts directory](concepts).
