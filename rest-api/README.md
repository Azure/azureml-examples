Welcome to the Azure Machine Learning examples repository!

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
2. Postman

This section is intended to serve as a starting point for REST requests to AzureML! All sample payloads are included in the sample payloads folder, and a Postman Collection is included here to help you get started. The postman collection contains the URIs, and the customizations you can make to the payloads.

## Contents

A lightweight template repository for automating the ML lifecycle can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-template). The contents of this repository are described below.
