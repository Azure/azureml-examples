    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to illustrate how to use the AutoML deep learning model, temporal convolutional network (TCN), for demand forecasting tasks. It walks you through all stages of model evaluation and production process starting with data ingestion and concluding with scheduling inference runs. For more information on the TCN model in AutoML refer to this [publication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automl-forecasting-deep-learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a subset of UCI electricity data ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014#)) with the objective of predicting electricity demand per consumer 24 hours ahead. The data was preprocessed using the [data prep notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/v1/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/forecasting-data-preparation/auto-ml-forecasting-data-preparation.ipynb) notebook. Please refer to it for illustration on how to download the data from the source, aggregate to an hourly frequency, convert from wide to long format and upload to the Datastore. Here, we will work with the already uploaded data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a problem description such as to generate accurate forecasts 24 hours ahead sounds like a relatively straight forward task. However, there are quite a few steps a user needs to take before the model is put in production. A user needs to prepare the data, partition it into appropriate sets, select the best model, evaluate it against a baseline, and monitor the model in real life to collect enough observations on how it would perform had it been put in production. Some of these steps are time consuming, some require certain expertise in writing code. The steps shown in this notebook follow a typical thought process one follows before the model is put in production.\n",

Take, for example, the MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) metric. A perfect forecast will result in the MAPE value of zero, which is not achievable using business data.
