the O

Czech B-LOC

Some O

van O

says O
such O
a O
threat O
might O
be O
exaggerated O
despite O
the O
Czech B-LOC

" O
I O

I O
think O
that O
this O

which O

said O
it O
would O

, O
but O
that O
Zywiec B-ORG

potential O
production O
of O

was O
a O
medium-term O

rather O
than O
a O

He O
said O
his O

would O
be O

off O

that O
even O

Lieutenant-General O

told O

his O
main O
concern O

for O

about O

If O
he O

it O

for O

, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O

for O
the O

, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-LOC
and O
the O
Zairean B-MISC
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O

he O

" O
Tomorrow O

General O

Kabila I-PER
in O
Goma B-LOC
last O

but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan B-MISC
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O

force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O

Canadian B-MISC

that O

probably O

intervene O
militarily O

" O

as O
though O
they O
( O

) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O

" O
Young B-PER
told O

But O
General O
Baril B-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O

" O
We O
hope O
that O

" O
If O
they O

then O
we O

In O
June O
, O
the O
WTO B-ORG
hailed O
Singapore B-LOC
for O
its O
open O
market O

but O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG

other O
trading O
powers O
called O
on O
Singapore B-LOC
to O
speed O
up O
the O
opening O
of O
its O

Supple B-PER
said O
the O
struggle O
that O
Singapore B-LOC
had O
to O
wage O
in O
vying O
to O
host O
the O
meeting O
would O
be O
repeated O

" O
There O
is O
tension O
at O

" O
since O

the O

been O
drawn O
over O
the O
issue O

he O
said O

Supple B-PER
said O
hosting O
the O
meeting O
carried O
prestige O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
, O
" O
however O
, O
this O
is O
quite O
intangible O
as O
the O
prestige O
factor O
may O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
any O
additional O
investment O
and O

to O
this O
region O
. O
" O

From O
a O
commercial O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
meeting O
would O
be O
good O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
tourism O
industry O
, O
Tan B-PER
said O
. O

A O
large O
part O
of O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
workforce O
would O
be O
mobilised O
to O
ensure O
the O
meeting O
would O
run O
without O
a O
glitch O
but O
the O
average O
Singaporean B-MISC
" O
would O
probably O
not O
be O
too O
concerned O
about O
some O
of O
the O
issues O
, O
" O
Tan B-PER
said O
. O

" O
But O
the O
more O
educated O
public O
will O
realise O
that O
these O
kind O
of O
things O
are O
important O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
as O
a O
small O
economy O
. O
" O

Supple B-PER
said O
any O
political O
gains O
the O
Singapore B-LOC
government O
would O
get O
from O
the O
WTO B-ORG
meeting O
-- O
ahead O
of O
a O
general O
election O
due O
by O
April O
1997 O
-- O
would O
depend O
on O
how O
successful O
it O
was O
in O
pushing O
its O
economic O
agenda O
. O

" O
If O
there O
are O
any O
movements O
toward O
freer O
trade O
, O
then O
Singapore B-LOC

the O

" O

" O

But O
I O
do O

it O

up O
the O
