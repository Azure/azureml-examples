For example, if the original dataset has 1000 samples, `validation_size = 0.2` and `test_size = 0.1`, the final test set will have `1000 * 0.1 = 100` samples, training set will have `1000 * (1 - 0.1) * (1 - 0.2) = 720` samples and validation set will have `1000 * (1 - 0.1) * 0.2 = 180` samples\n",

Test data in the form of a `Dataset` can be passed in to `AutoMLConfig` using the `test_data` parameter. When this parameter is specified, a test run will be started after all training runs have completed and the best model has been identified.\n",
