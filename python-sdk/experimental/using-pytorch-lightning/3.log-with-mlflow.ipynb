    "description: log mlflow metrics in pytorch lightning with azureml as the backend tracking store\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightning supports many popular [logging frameworks](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/loggers.html). [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a popular open-source library for managing the lifecycle of your ML projects. Azure ML offers integration with MLflow, including for training. Specifically, Azure ML integrates as a backend tracking store for MLflow's [Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#) component for logging metrics and managing runs. This tutorial will cover using the MLflow logger and leveraging the Azure ML MLflow integration."

    "* **Tracking URI**: Specify the tracking URI to point to your Azure ML Workspace in order to use Azure ML as the backend tracking store for MLflow. You can get the URI with mlflow.get_tracking_uri().\n",

    "To get the MLflow Run object of the training run, use the mlflow `mlflow.start_run()` method. Once you have the Run object, you can then access the experiment information.\n",

    "### 2. Log metrics\n",
    "You can then log metrics and other objects in your script. This tutorial's training script leverages Lightning's automatic log functionalities to log the loss metric by calling `self.log()` inside the `training_step()` method. Since logging too frequently can slow down training, the tutorial logs at the end of every epoch.\n",
