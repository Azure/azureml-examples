description: Notebook showing how to use AutoML for training an Object Detection model. We will use a small dataset to train the model, demonstrate how you can tune hyperparameters of the model to optimize model performance and deploy the model to use in inference scenarios.

# Object Detection using AutoML for Images
- Dataset: [Fridge Objects from computervision-recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes)
    - **[Jupyter Notebook](auto-ml-image-object-detection.ipynb)**
        - train an Object Detection model using AutoML
        - tune hyperparameters of the model to optimize model performance
        - deploy the model to use in inference scenarios
