U.S. B-LOC

" O
The O
way O

, O
tampering O

, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O

reputation O

this O
U.S. B-MISC
Open I-MISC
in O
the O
players O

we O
think O
that O

damaging O
to O
our O
sport O

" O
Martin B-PER
said O
. O

Stich B-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O

not O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B-PER

that O

done O

, O
who O
lost O
the O

on O

The O
flamboyant O

up O

" O
said O

about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O

made O

from O

, O
not O
seeded O

the O
first O

might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O

Ranked O
18th O

ahead O
of O

he O
said O

I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O

that O

probably O

later O
in O

, O
Hope B-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O

I O
think O
the O
figure O
