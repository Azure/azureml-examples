## Public Preview

We are excited to introduce the private preview of Azure Machine Learning **Python SDK v2**. Azure ML Python SDK v2 is an updated Python SDK package, which allows users to:

* Submit training jobs
* Manage data, models, environments
* Perform managed inferencing (real time and batch)
* Stitch together multiple tasks and production workflows using Azure ML pipelines
* Run standalone AutoML training for various ml-tasks

Please note that this Private Preview release is subject to the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Why should I use the new SDK v2?

The SDK v2 comes with many improvements and features:

* Use Python functions to build a single step or a complex workflow

  SDK v2 allows you to build a single command or a chain of commands like python functions - the command has a name, parameters, expects input, and returns output.

* Move from simple to complex concepts incrementally

  SDK v2 allows you to:
  * Construct a single command.
  * Add a hyperparameter sweep on top of that command,
  * Add the command with various others into a pipeline one after the other.
  This construction is useful, given the iterative nature of machine learning.

* Reusable components in pipelines

  Azure ML introduces components for managing and reusing common logic across pipelines. This functionality is available only via CLI v2 and SDK v2.

* Managed inferencing

  Azure ML offers endpoints to streamline model deployments for both real-time and batch inference deployments. This functionality is available only via CLI v2 and SDK v2.

## How do I use this feature?

Python SDK v2 can be used in various ways â€“ in python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks to create, submit / manage jobs, pipelines, and your resources/assets. You can use the Azure ML notebooks, VS Code or other editors of your choice to manage to your code. Checkout an [over view of our samples](#examples-available).

## How can I provide feedback?

If you are facing any issues while using the new feature, please reach out to [Azure ML SDK feedback](mailto:amlsdkfeedback@microsoft.com). For general feedback, please submit an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/new/choose).
