    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace with computer cluster - [Configure workspace](../../jobs/configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create a batch endpoint from Python SDK\n",
    "- Create deployments on that endpoint from Python SDK\n",
    "- Test a deployment with a sample request\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to create an online endpoint and manage deployments on that endpoint. An endpoint is an HTTPS endpoint that clients can call to receive the inferencing (scoring) output of a trained model. Online endpoints are endpoints that are used for online (real-time) inferencing.
