    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* To use Azure Machine Learning, you must have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).\n",

    "* Install and configure the [Python SDK v2](sdk/setup.sh).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must have an Azure resource group, and you (or the service principal you use) must have Contributor access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must have an Azure Machine Learning workspace. \n",

    "### Please note, for Triton no-code-deployemnt, testing via local endpoints is currently not supported, so this tutorial will only show how to set up on online endpoint.\n",
