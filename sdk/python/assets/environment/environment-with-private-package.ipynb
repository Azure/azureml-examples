    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace - [Configure workspace](../../jobs/configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",

They specify the Python packages, environment variables, and software settings around your training and scoring scripts. They also specify run times (Python, Spark, or Docker). The environments are managed and versioned entities within your Machine Learning workspace that enable reproducible, auditable, and portable machine learning workflows across a variety of computes.\n",
