    "\n",
    "This is the companion notebook for the article on sharing components, environments and models across workspaces: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-share-models-pipelines-across-workspaces-with-registries \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Review the prerequisites section in the article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-share-models-pipelines-across-workspaces-with-registries?tabs=python#prerequisites. To summarize, in addition to the Python SDK, you need an AzureML registry and an AzureML workspace in a region that is supported by the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two scenarios where you'd want to use the same set of models, components and environments in multiple workspaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-workspace MLOps: You're training a model in a dev workspace and need to deploy it to test and prod workspaces. In this case you, want to have end-to-end lineage between endpoints to which the model is deployed in test or prod workspaces and the training job, metrics, code, data and environment that was used to train the model in the dev workspace.\n",
    "* Share and reuse models and pipelines across different teams: Sharing and reuse improve collaboration and productivity. In this scenario, you may want to publish a trained model and the associated components and environments used to train it to a central catalog. From there, colleagues from other teams can search and reuse the assets you shared in their own experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "* Create an environment and component in the registry.\n",
    "* Use the component from registry to submit a model training job in a workspace.\n",
    "* Register the trained model in the registry.\n",
    "* Deploy the model from the registry to an online-endpoint in the workspace, then submit an inference request.\n"
