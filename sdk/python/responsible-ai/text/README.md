## Azure Machine Learning Responsible AI Dashboard and Scorecard 

### overview

Read more about how to generate the Responsible AI (RAI) dashboard [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard-sdk-cli?tabs=yaml) and Responsible AI scorecard [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-responsible-ai-scorecard).

The Responsible AI components are supported for MLflow models with `scikit-learn` flavor that are trained on `pandas.DataFrame`.
The components accept both models and SciKit-Learn pipelines as input as long as the model or pipeline implements `predict` and `predict_proba` functions that conforms to the `scikit-learn` convention.
If not compatible, you can wrap your model's prediction function into a wrapper class that transforms the output into the format that is supported (`predict` and `predict_proba` of `scikit-learn`), and pass that wrapper class to modules in this repo.

### objective
The main objective of this tutorial is to help users understand the process of creating responsible ai dashboard with explanations & error analysis for text dataset.

### programming languages
 - Python

### estimated runtime

### supportability ðŸ§°
Currently, we support datasets having numerical and categorical features. The following table provides the scenarios supported for each of the four responsible AI components:
> **Note**: Model overview (performance metrics and fairness disparity metrics) and Data explorer are generated for every Responsible AI dashboard by default and do not require a component to be configured.

| RAI component | Binary classification | Multi-class classification | Multilabel classification | Regression | Timeseries forecasting | Categorical features | Text features | Image Features | Recommender Systems | Reinforcement Learning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Explainability | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Error Analysis | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Causal Analysis | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | Yes (max 5 features due to computational cost) | No | No | No | No |
| Counterfactual | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No | No |
