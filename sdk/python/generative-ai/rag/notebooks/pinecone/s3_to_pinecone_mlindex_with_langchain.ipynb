    "## Which Embeddings Model to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two supported Embedding options: OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` embedding model or HuggingFace embedding models. Here are some factors that might influence your decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI has [great documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) on their Embeddings model `text-embedding-ada-002`, it can handle up to 8191 tokens and can be accessed using [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models) or OpenAI directly.\n",
    "If you have an existing Azure OpenAI Instance you can connect it to AzureML, if you don't AzureML provisions a default one for you called `Default_AzureOpenAI`.\n",
    "The main limitation when using `text-embedding-ada-002` is cost/quota available for the model. Otherwise it provides high quality embeddings across a wide array of text domains while being simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HuggingFace\n",
    "\n",
    "HuggingFace hosts many different models capable of embedding text into single-dimensional vectors. The [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) ranks the performance of embeddings models on a few axis, not all models ranked can be run locally (e.g. `text-embedding-ada-002` is on the list), though many can and there is a range of larger and smaller models. When embedding with HuggingFace the model is loaded locally for inference, this will potentially impact your choice of compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The default PromptFlow Runtime does not come with HuggingFace model dependencies installed, Indexes created using HuggingFace embeddings will not work in PromptFlow by default. **Pick OpenAI if you want to use PromptFlow**"
