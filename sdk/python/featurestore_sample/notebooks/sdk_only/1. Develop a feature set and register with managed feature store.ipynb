    "You don't need to explicitly install these resources for this tutorial, because in the set-up instructions shown here, the `conda.yml` file covers them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the notebook environment for development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Azure Machine Learning studio environment, select Notebooks on the left pane, and then select the Samples tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Browse to the featurestore_sample directory (select **Samples** > **SDK v2** > **sdk** > **python** > **featurestore_sample**), and then select **Clone**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Select target directory** panel opens. Select the **Users** directory and then select _your user name_, and then select **Clone**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Option 1: Create a new notebook, and execute the instructions in this document, step by step.\n",
    "   * Option 2: Open existing notebook `featurestore_sample/notebooks/sdk_only/1. Develop a feature set and register with managed feature store.ipynb`. You may keep this document open and refer to it for more explanation and documentation links.\n",

    "1. To configure the notebook environment, you must upload the conda.yml file\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Select **Notebooks** on the left pane, and then select the **Files** tab.\n",
    "   1. Browse to the *env* directory (select **Users** > *your_user_name* > **featurestore_sample** > **project** > **env**), and then select the conda.yml file.\n",
    "   1. Select **Download**\n",
    "   1. Select **Serverless Spark Compute** in the top navigation **Compute** dropdown. This operation might take one to two minutes. Wait for a status bar in the top to display **Configure session**.\n",
    "   1. Select **Configure session** in the top status bar.\n",
    "   1. Select **Python packages**.\n",
    "   1. Select **Upload conda file**.\n",
    "   1. Select the `conda.yml` you downloaded on your local device.\n",
