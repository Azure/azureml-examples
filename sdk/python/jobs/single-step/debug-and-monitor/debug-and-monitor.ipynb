    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace with computer cluster - [Configure workspace](../../../configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create and run a `Command` which executes a Python command\n",
    "- Use a local file as an `input` to the Command\n",
    "- Enable live debugging & monitoring by specifying `services` to the Command job\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run a Command. The Command is a fundamental construct of Azure Machine Learning. It can be used to run a task on a specified compute (either local or on the cloud). The Command accepts `environment` and `compute` to setup required infrastructure. You can define a `command` to run on this infrastructure with `inputs`."

Check out the [environment](../../../../assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the command will run. In this example we are using a compute called `cpu-cluster` present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the command on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",

You can specify `vs_code`, `tensor_board` (needs log directory), `jupyter_lab` or `SSH` (needs public key). For distributed jobs, you can specify the specific compute `nodes` index you would like to interact with. If `nodes` are not specified, interactive services are enabled only on the head node by default."
