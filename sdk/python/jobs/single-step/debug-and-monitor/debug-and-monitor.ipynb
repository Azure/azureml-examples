    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace  - [Configure workspace](../../../configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create and run a `Command` which executes a Python command\n",
    "- Use a local file as an `input` to the Command\n",
    "- Enable live debugging & monitoring by specifying `services` to the Command job\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run a Command. The Command is a fundamental construct of Azure Machine Learning. It can be used to run a task on a specified compute (either local or on the cloud). The Command accepts `environment` and `compute` to setup required infrastructure. Alternatively, [serverless compute (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-serverless-compute?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python) can also be used to run the training job. You can define a `command` to run on this infrastructure with `inputs`."

    "- `code` - This is the path where the code to run the command is located\n",
    "- `command` - This is the command that needs to be run. If you need to reserve your cluster for debugging or monitoring purposes, you can use the `sleep` command.\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](../../../../assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the command will run. In this example we are using [serverless compute (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-serverless-compute?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python) so there is no need to specify any compute. You can also replace serverless with any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the command on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
    "- `display_name` - The display name of the Job\n",
    "- `description` - The description of the experiment\n",
    "- `services` - Specify the applications (or SSH) that you need to interact with the live running job. You can specify `vs_code`, `tensor_board` (needs log directory), `jupyter_lab` or `SSH` (needs public key). For distributed jobs, you can specify the specific compute `nodes` index you would like to interact with. If `nodes` are not specified, interactive services are enabled only on the head node by default."
