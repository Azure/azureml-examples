    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace with computer cluster - [Configure workspace](../../../configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create and run a **distributed** `Command` which executes a Python command\n",
    "- Use a local file as an `input` to the Command\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run a Command. The Command is a fundamental construct of Azure Machine Learning. It can be used to run a task on a specified compute (either local or on the cloud). The Command accepts `environment` and `compute` to setup required infrastructure. You can define a `command` to run on this infrastructure with `inputs`."

    "# 2. Configure and run the Command\n",
    "In this section we will configure and run a standalone job using the `command` class. The `command` class can be used to run standalone jobs and can also be used as a function inside pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Configure the Command\n",
    "The `command` allows user to configure the following key aspects.\n",
    "- `code` - This is the path where the code to run the command is located\n",
    "- `command` - This is the command that needs to be run\n",
    "- `inputs` - This is the dictionary of inputs using name value pairs to the command. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. Inputs can be referenced in the `command` using the `${{inputs.<input_name>}}` expression. To use files or folders as inputs, we can use the `Input` class. The `Input` class supports three parameters:\n",
    "    - `type` - The type of input. This can be a `uri_file` or `uri_folder`. The default is `uri_folder`.         \n",
    "    - `path` - The path to the file or folder. These can be local or remote files or folders. For remote files - http/https, wasb are supported. \n",
    "        - Azure ML `data`/`dataset` or `datastore` are of type `uri_folder`. To use `data`/`dataset` as input, you can use registered dataset in the workspace using the format '<data_name>:<version>'. For e.g Input(type='uri_folder', path='my_dataset:1')\n",
    "    - `mode` - \tMode of how the data should be delivered to the compute target. Allowed values are `ro_mount`, `rw_mount` and `download`. Default is `ro_mount`\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](../../../../assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the command will run. In this example we are using a compute called `cpu-cluster` present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the command on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
    "- `distribution` - Distribution configuration for distributed training scenarios. Azure Machine Learning supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MPI-based distributed training. The allowed values are `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `Mpi`.\n",
    "- `display_name` - The display name of the Job\n",
    "- `description` - The description of the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use `MPI` for distribution."
