    "This example trains and registers a TensorFlow model to classify handwritten digits using a deep neural network (DNN). MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit each image represents, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",
