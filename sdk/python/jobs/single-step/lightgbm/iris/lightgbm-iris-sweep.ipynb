    "\n",
    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace with computer cluster - [Configure workspace](../../../configuration.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Create and run a `Command` from Python SDK.\n",
    "- Use the `SweepJob ` to run a hyperparameter sweep on this Command\n",
    "- Create a `CommandComponent` from Python SDK.\n",
    "- Use the `SweepJob ` to run a hyperparameter sweep on the CommandComponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This example explains how Azure Machine Learning lets you automate hyperparameter tuning using the SweepJob to efficiently optimize hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that let you control the model training process. Hyperparameter tuning, also called hyperparameter optimization, is the process of finding the configuration of hyperparameters that results in the best performance. "

    "# 2. Configure and run the Command\n",
    "In this section we will configure and run a standalone job using the `command` class. The `command` class can be used to run standalone jobs and can also be used as a function inside pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Configure the Command\n",
    "The `command` allows user to configure the following key aspects.\n",
    "- `code` - This is the path where the code to run the command is located\n",
    "- `command` - This is the command that needs to be run\n",
    "- `inputs` - This is the dictionary of inputs using name value pairs to the command. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. Inputs can be referenced in the `command` using the `${{inputs.<input_name>}}` expression. To use files or folders as inputs, we can use the `Input` class. The `Input` class supports three parameters:\n",
    "    - `type` - The type of input. This can be a `uri_file` or `uri_folder`. The default is `uri_folder`.         \n",
    "    - `path` - The path to the file or folder. These can be local or remote files or folders. For remote files - http/https, wasb are supported. \n",
    "        - Azure ML `data`/`dataset` or `datastore` are of type `uri_folder`. To use `data`/`dataset` as input, you can use registered dataset in the workspace using the format '<data_name>:<version>'. For e.g Input(type='uri_folder', path='my_dataset:1')\n",
    "    - `mode` - \tMode of how the data should be delivered to the compute target. Allowed values are `ro_mount`, `rw_mount` and `download`. Default is `ro_mount`\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](../../../../assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the command will run. In this example we are using a compute called `cpu-cluster` present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the command on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
    "- `distribution` - Distribution configuration for distributed training scenarios. Azure Machine Learning supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MPI-based distributed training. The allowed values are `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `Mpi`.\n",
    "- `display_name` - The display name of the Job\n",
