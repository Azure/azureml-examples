Transfer learning is a technique that applies knowledge gained from solving one problem to a different but related problem. Transfer learning shortens the training process by requiring less data, time, and compute resources than training from scratch. To learn more about transfer learning, see the [deep learning vs machine learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning#what-is-transfer-learning) article.\n",
