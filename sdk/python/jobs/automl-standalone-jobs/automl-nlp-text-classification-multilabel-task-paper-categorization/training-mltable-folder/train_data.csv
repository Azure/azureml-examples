Background-Foreground Segmentation for Interior Sensing in Automotive Industry,"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the situation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat occupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important role in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is possible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the presence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars at the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare different statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach the problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior sensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques have been developed and applied to images or videos from different applications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is, that the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as dynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is not completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging, i.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural network, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical methods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown. Furthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by deep learning, e.g.\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground truth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce high quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we demonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing methods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Direct Estimation of Appearance Models for Segmentation,"Image segmentation algorithms often depend on appearance models that characterize the distribution of pixel values in different image regions. We describe a new approach for estimating appearance models directly from an image, without explicit consideration of the pixels that make up each region. Our approach is based on novel algebraic expressions that relate local image statistics to the appearance of spatially coherent regions. We describe two algorithms that can use the aforementioned algebraic expressions to estimate appearance models directly from an image. The first algorithm solves a system of linear and quadratic equations using a least squares formulation. The second algorithm is a spectral method based on an eigenvector computation. We present experimental results that demonstrate the proposed methods work well in practice and lead to effective image segmentation algorithms.",['cs.CV']
Patch-based medical image segmentation using Quantum Tensor Networks,"Tensor networks are efficient factorisations of high dimensional tensors into a network of lower order tensors. They have been most commonly used to model entanglement in quantum many-body systems and more recently are witnessing increased applications in supervised machine learning. In this work, we formulate image segmentation in a supervised setting with tensor networks. The key idea is to first lift the pixels in image patches to exponentially high dimensional feature spaces and using a linear decision hyper-plane to classify the input pixels into foreground and background classes. The high dimensional linear model itself is approximated using the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network. The MPS is weight-shared between the non-overlapping image patches resulting in our strided tensor network model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on three 2D- and one 3D- biomedical imaging datasets. The performance of the proposed tensor network segmentation model is compared with relevant baseline methods. In the 2D experiments, the tensor network model yeilds competitive performance compared to the baseline methods while being more resource efficient.",['cs.CV']
POPCORN: Progressive Pseudo-labeling with Consistency Regularization and Neighboring,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to compensate for the scarcity of annotated images and the lack of method generalization to unseen domains, two usual problems in medical segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose POPCORN, a novel method combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling designed for image segmentation. The proposed framework uses high-level regularization to constrain our segmentation model to use similar latent features for images with similar segmentations. POPCORN estimates a proximity graph to select data from easiest ones to more difficult ones, in order to ensure accurate pseudo-labeling and to limit confirmation bias. Applied to multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation, our method demonstrates competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art SSL strategies.",['cs.CV']
Pyramid Medical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep neural networks have been a prevailing technique in the field of medical image processing. However, the most popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods for medical image segmentation are imperfect because they model long-range dependencies by stacking layers or enlarging filters. Transformers and the self-attention mechanism are recently proposed to effectively learn long-range dependencies by modeling all pairs of word-to-word attention regardless of their positions. The idea has also been extended to the computer vision field by creating and treating image patches as embeddings. Considering the computation complexity for whole image self-attention, current transformer-based models settle for a rigid partitioning scheme that potentially loses informative relations. Besides, current medical transformers model global context on full resolution images, leading to unnecessary computation costs. To address these issues, we developed a novel method to integrate multi-scale attention and CNN feature extraction using a pyramidal network architecture, namely Pyramid Medical Transformer (PMTrans). The PMTrans captured multi-range relations by working on multi-resolution images. An adaptive partitioning scheme was implemented to retain informative relations and to access different receptive fields efficiently. Experimental results on three medical image datasets (gland segmentation, MoNuSeg, and HECKTOR datasets) showed that PMTrans outperformed the latest CNN-based and transformer-based models for medical image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Segmenter: Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"Image segmentation is often ambiguous at the level of individual image patches and requires contextual information to reach label consensus. In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Fully Transformer Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Transformers have shown impressive performance in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, due to the capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Recent progress has demonstrated to combine such transformers with CNN-based semantic image segmentation models is very promising. However, it is not well studied yet on how well a pure transformer based approach can achieve for image segmentation. In this work, we explore a novel framework for semantic image segmentation, which is encoder-decoder based Fully Transformer Networks (FTN). Specifically, we first propose a Pyramid Group Transformer (PGT) as the encoder for progressively learning hierarchical features, while reducing the computation complexity of the standard visual transformer(ViT). Then, we propose a Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) to fuse semantic-level and spatial-level information from multiple levels of the PGT encoder for semantic image segmentation. Surprisingly, this simple baseline can achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL Context, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. The source code will be released upon the publication of this work.",['cs.CV']
PoissonSeg: Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation via Poisson Learning,"The application of deep learning to medical image segmentation has been hampered due to the lack of abundant pixel-level annotated data. Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) is a promising strategy for breaking the deadlock. However, a high-performing FSS model still requires sufficient pixel-level annotated classes for training to avoid overfitting, which leads to its performance bottleneck in medical image segmentation due to the unmet need for annotations. Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly proposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement. Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1) neglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using unlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated representation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel semi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation. The proposed framework employs Poisson learning for modeling data relationship and propagating supervision signals, and Spatial Consistency Calibration for encouraging the model to learn more coherent representations. In this process, unlabeled samples do not involve in end-to-end training, but provide supervisory information for query image segmentation through graph-based learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three medical image segmentation datasets (i.e. ISIC skin lesion segmentation, abdominal organs segmentation for MRI and abdominal organs segmentation for CT) to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and broad applicability of the proposed framework.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Comprehensive Multi-Modal Interactions for Referring Image Segmentation,"We investigate Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which outputs a segmentation map corresponding to the given natural language description. To solve RIS efficiently, we need to understand each word's relationship with other words, each region in the image to other regions, and cross-modal alignment between linguistic and visual domains. We argue that one of the limiting factors in the recent methods is that they do not handle these interactions simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel architecture called JRNet, which uses a Joint Reasoning Module(JRM) to concurrently capture the inter-modal and intra-modal interactions. The output of JRM is passed through a novel Cross-Modal Multi-Level Fusion (CMMLF) module which further refines the segmentation masks by exchanging contextual information across visual hierarchy through linguistic features acting as a bridge. We present thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four benchmark datasets, showing considerable performance gains over the existing state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Mapping Vulnerable Populations with AI,"Humanitarian actions require accurate information to efficiently delegate support operations. Such information can be maps of building footprints, building functions, and population densities. While the access to this information is comparably easy in industrialized countries thanks to reliable census data and national geo-data infrastructures, this is not the case for developing countries, where that data is often incomplete or outdated. Building maps derived from remote sensing images may partially remedy this challenge in such countries, but are not always accurate due to different landscape configurations and lack of validation data. Even when they exist, building footprint layers usually do not reveal more fine-grained building properties, such as the number of stories or the building's function (e.g., office, residential, school, etc.). In this project we aim to automate building footprint and function mapping using heterogeneous data sources. In a first step, we intend to delineate buildings from satellite data, using deep learning models for semantic image segmentation. Building functions shall be retrieved by parsing social media data like for instance tweets, as well as ground-based imagery, to automatically identify different buildings functions and retrieve further information such as the number of building stories. Building maps augmented with those additional attributes make it possible to derive more accurate population density maps, needed to support the targeted provision of humanitarian aid.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
LeViT-UNet: Make Faster Encoders with Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many challenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures based on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of medical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution operations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and long-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce transformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results, but the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational complexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which integrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and accurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder of the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the Transformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks and convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via skip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the feature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves better performance comparing to various competing methods on several challenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC. Code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/LeViT_UNet.",['cs.CV']
Double Similarity Distillation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"The balance between high accuracy and high speed has always been a challenging task in semantic image segmentation. Compact segmentation networks are more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances are constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global aggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge distillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve the classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the similarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively. Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that utilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies across multiple layers. Compared with exiting methods, the PSD module greatly reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore, considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation task and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and only a minimal increase in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC 2012, show that DSD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its effectiveness and generality. The code and models will be publicly available.",['cs.CV']
A Weighted Difference of Anisotropic and Isotropic Total Variation for Relaxed Mumford-Shah Color and Multiphase Image Segmentation,"In a class of piecewise-constant image segmentation models, we propose to incorporate a weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation (AITV) to regularize the partition boundaries in an image. In particular, we replace the total variation regularization in the Chan-Vese segmentation model and a fuzzy region competition model by the proposed AITV. To deal with the nonconvex nature of AITV, we apply the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), in which the subproblems can be minimized by the primal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch. The convergence of the DCA scheme is analyzed. In addition, a generalization to color image segmentation is discussed. In the numerical experiments, we compare the proposed models with the classic convex approaches and the two-stage segmentation methods (smoothing and then thresholding) on various images, showing that our models are effective in image segmentation and robust with respect to impulsive noises.",['cs.CV']
TransFuse: Fusing Transformers and CNNs for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation - the prerequisite of numerous clinical needs - has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge. TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransFuse achieves the newest state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical image sets including polyp, skin lesion, hip, and prostate segmentation, with significant parameter decrease and inference speed improvement.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation using Psychometric Learning,"Assigning meaning to parts of image data is the goal of semantic image segmentation. Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the pathologist.   To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with evaluation on the synthetically generated image, aerial image and histology image.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Semi-supervised Left Atrium Segmentation with Mutual Consistency Training,"Semi-supervised learning has attracted great attention in the field of machine learning, especially for medical image segmentation tasks, since it alleviates the heavy burden of collecting abundant densely annotated data for training. However, most of existing methods underestimate the importance of challenging regions (e.g. small branches or blurred edges) during training. We believe that these unlabeled regions may contain more crucial information to minimize the uncertainty prediction for the model and should be emphasized in the training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Mutual Consistency Network (MC-Net) for semi-supervised left atrium segmentation from 3D MR images. Particularly, our MC-Net consists of one encoder and two slightly different decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are transformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme to encourage mutual consistency. Such mutual consistency encourages the two decoders to have consistent and low-entropy predictions and enables the model to gradually capture generalized features from these unlabeled challenging regions. We evaluate our MC-Net on the public Left Atrium (LA) database and it obtains impressive performance gains by exploiting the unlabeled data effectively. Our MC-Net outperforms six recent semi-supervised methods for left atrium segmentation, and sets the new state-of-the-art performance on the LA database.",['cs.CV']
Quality-Aware Memory Network for Interactive Volumetric Image Segmentation,"Despite recent progress of automatic medical image segmentation techniques, fully automatic results usually fail to meet the clinical use and typically require further refinement. In this work, we propose a quality-aware memory network for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images. Provided by user guidance on an arbitrary slice, an interaction network is firstly employed to obtain an initial 2D segmentation. The quality-aware memory network subsequently propagates the initial segmentation estimation bidirectionally over the entire volume. Subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. To further facilitate interactive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest the next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each slice. The proposed network has two appealing characteristics: 1) The memory-augmented network offers the ability to quickly encode past segmentation information, which will be retrieved for the segmentation of other slices; 2) The quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the qualities of segmentation predictions, which allows an active learning paradigm where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round refinement. The proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g., scribbles, boxes). Experimental results on various medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in comparison with existing techniques.",['cs.CV']
CHASE: Robust Visual Tracking via Cell-Level Differentiable Neural Architecture Search,"A strong visual object tracker nowadays relies on its well-crafted modules, which typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver high-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior experience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile, neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such as image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the objective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over five commonly-used benchmarks. Meanwhile, our automated searching process takes 41 (18) hours for the second (first) order DARTS method on the TrackingNet dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Unsupervised Image Segmentation by Mutual Information Maximization and Adversarial Regularization,"Semantic segmentation is one of the basic, yet essential scene understanding tasks for an autonomous agent. The recent developments in supervised machine learning and neural networks have enjoyed great success in enhancing the performance of the state-of-the-art techniques for this task. However, their superior performance is highly reliant on the availability of a large-scale annotated dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel fully unsupervised semantic segmentation method, the so-called Information Maximization and Adversarial Regularization Segmentation (InMARS). Inspired by human perception which parses a scene into perceptual groups, rather than analyzing each pixel individually, our proposed approach first partitions an input image into meaningful regions (also known as superpixels). Next, it utilizes Mutual-Information-Maximization followed by an adversarial training strategy to cluster these regions into semantically meaningful classes. To customize an adversarial training scheme for the problem, we incorporate adversarial pixel noise along with spatial perturbations to impose photometrical and geometrical invariance on the deep neural network. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used unsupervised semantic segmentation datasets, COCO-Stuff, and Potsdam.",['cs.CV']
Segmenting two-dimensional structures with strided tensor networks,"Tensor networks provide an efficient approximation of operations involving high dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum many-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with tensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of tensor networks for supervised image segmentation which allows them to operate on high resolution medical images. We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping patches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a pixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a Strided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and compared to relevant baselines. The evaluation shows that the strided tensor network yields competitive performance compared to CNN-based models while using fewer resources. Additionally, based on the experiments we discuss the feasibility of using fully linear models for segmentation tasks.",['cs.CV']
Poisoning the Search Space in Neural Architecture Search,"Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective problem-solving tool for object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS) against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CR', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']"
Boosting Semi-supervised Image Segmentation with Global and Local Mutual Information Regularization,"The scarcity of labeled data often impedes the application of deep learning to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation. Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full supervision while training with very few annotated images.",['cs.CV']
Adversarial Segmentation Loss for Sketch Colorization,"We introduce a new method for generating color images from sketches or edge maps. Current methods either require some form of additional user-guidance or are limited to the ""paired"" translation approach. We argue that segmentation information could provide valuable guidance for sketch colorization. To this end, we propose to leverage semantic image segmentation, as provided by a general purpose panoptic segmentation network, to create an additional adversarial loss function. Our loss function can be integrated to any baseline GAN model. Our method is not limited to datasets that contain segmentation labels, and it can be trained for ""unpaired"" translation tasks. We show the effectiveness of our method on four different datasets spanning scene level indoor, outdoor, and children book illustration images using qualitative, quantitative and user study analysis. Our model improves its baseline up to 35 points on the FID metric. Our code and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/giddyyupp/AdvSegLoss.",['cs.CV']
GSVNet: Guided Spatially-Varying Convolution for Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video,"This paper addresses fast semantic segmentation on video.Video segmentation often calls for real-time, or even fasterthan real-time, processing. One common recipe for conserving computation arising from feature extraction is to propagate features of few selected keyframes. However, recent advances in fast image segmentation make these solutions less attractive. To leverage fast image segmentation for furthering video segmentation, we propose a simple yet efficient propagation framework. Specifically, we perform lightweight flow estimation in 1/8-downscaled image space for temporal warping in segmentation outpace space. Moreover, we introduce a guided spatially-varying convolution for fusing segmentations derived from the previous and current frames, to mitigate propagation error and enable lightweight feature extraction on non-keyframes. Experimental results on Cityscapes and CamVid show that our scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off on video segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
A Thorough View of Exact Inference in Graphs from the Degree-4 Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy,"Performing inference in graphs is a common task within several machine learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others. For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']"
Analysis of Vision-based Abnormal Red Blood Cell Classification,"Identification of abnormalities in red blood cells (RBC) is key to diagnosing a range of medical conditions from anaemia to liver disease. Currently this is done manually, a time-consuming and subjective process. This paper presents an automated process utilising the advantages of machine learning to increase capacity and standardisation of cell abnormality detection, and its performance is analysed. Three different machine learning technologies were used: a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a classical machine learning technology; TabNet, a deep learning architecture for tabular data; U-Net, a semantic segmentation network designed for medical image segmentation. A critical issue was the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset which impacts the efficacy of machine learning. To address this, synthesising minority class samples in feature space was investigated via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and cost-sensitive learning. A combination of these two methods is investigated to improve the overall performance. These strategies were found to increase sensitivity to minority classes. The impact of unknown cells on semantic segmentation is demonstrated, with some evidence of the model applying learning of labelled cells to these anonymous cells. These findings indicate both classical models and new deep learning networks as promising methods in automating RBC abnormality detection.",['cs.CV']
DAAIN: Detection of Anomalous and Adversarial Input using Normalizing Flows,"Despite much recent work, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and adversarial attacks (AA) for computer vision models remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel technique, DAAIN, to detect OOD inputs and AA for image segmentation in a unified setting. Our approach monitors the inner workings of a neural network and learns a density estimator of the activation distribution. We equip the density estimator with a classification head to discriminate between regular and anomalous inputs. To deal with the high-dimensional activation-space of typical segmentation networks, we subsample them to obtain a homogeneous spatial and layer-wise coverage. The subsampling pattern is chosen once per monitored model and kept fixed for all inputs. Since the attacker has access to neither the detection model nor the sampling key, it becomes harder for them to attack the segmentation network, as the attack cannot be backpropagated through the detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an ESPNet trained on the Cityscapes dataset as segmentation model, an affine Normalizing Flow as density estimator and use blue noise to ensure homogeneous sampling. Our model can be trained on a single GPU making it compute efficient and deployable without requiring specialized accelerators.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']"
Predicting the Solar Potential of Rooftops using Image Segmentation and Structured Data,"Estimating the amount of electricity that can be produced by rooftop photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches. Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a rooftop.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
SemSegLoss: A python package of loss functions for semantic segmentation,"Image Segmentation has been an active field of research as it has a wide range of applications, ranging from automated disease detection to self-driving cars. In recent years, various research papers proposed different loss functions used in case of biased data, sparse segmentation, and unbalanced dataset. In this paper, we introduce SemSegLoss, a python package consisting of some of the well-known loss functions widely used for image segmentation. It is developed with the intent to help researchers in the development of novel loss functions and perform an extensive set of experiments on model architectures for various applications. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the presented package have allowed reducing the development time and increased evaluation strategies of machine learning models for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, different applications that use image segmentation can use SemSegLoss because of the generality of its functions. This wide range of applications will lead to the development and growth of AI across all industries.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
CheXseg: Combining Expert Annotations with DNN-generated Saliency Maps for X-ray Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation models are typically supervised by expert annotations at the pixel-level, which can be expensive to acquire. In this work, we propose a method that combines the high quality of pixel-level expert annotations with the scale of coarse DNN-generated saliency maps for training multi-label semantic segmentation models. We demonstrate the application of our semi-supervised method, which we call CheXseg, on multi-label chest X-ray interpretation. We find that CheXseg improves upon the performance (mIoU) of fully-supervised methods that use only pixel-level expert annotations by 9.7% and weakly-supervised methods that use only DNN-generated saliency maps by 73.1%. Our best method is able to match radiologist agreement on three out of ten pathologies and reduces the overall performance gap by 57.2% as compared to weakly-supervised methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
A Novel Falling-Ball Algorithm for Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background, and has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing. Practically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100% accuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in the literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel Falling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation algorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall model). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a ball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment basins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment basin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by dividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership function. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions and objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well as subjectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms gives superior performance over conventional Sobel edge detection methods and the watershed segmentation algorithm. For comparative analysis, various comparison methods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over existing segmentation methods.",['cs.CV']
Auxiliary Learning by Implicit Differentiation,"Training neural networks with auxiliary tasks is a common practice for improving the performance on a main task of interest. Two main challenges arise in this multi-task learning setting: (i) designing useful auxiliary tasks; and (ii) combining auxiliary tasks into a single coherent loss. Here, we propose a novel framework, AuxiLearn, that targets both challenges based on implicit differentiation. First, when useful auxiliaries are known, we propose learning a network that combines all losses into a single coherent objective function. This network can learn non-linear interactions between tasks. Second, when no useful auxiliary task is known, we describe how to learn a network that generates a meaningful, novel auxiliary task. We evaluate AuxiLearn in a series of tasks and domains, including image segmentation and learning with attributes in the low data regime, and find that it consistently outperforms competing methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Geodesic Paths for Image Segmentation with Implicit Region-based Homogeneity Enhancement,"Minimal paths are regarded as a powerful and efficient tool for boundary detection and image segmentation due to its global optimality and the well-established numerical solutions such as fast marching method. In this paper, we introduce a flexible interactive image segmentation model based on the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) framework in conjunction with region-based homogeneity enhancement. A key ingredient in the introduced model is the construction of local geodesic metrics, which are capable of integrating anisotropic and asymmetric edge features, implicit region-based homogeneity features and/or curvature regularization. The incorporation of the region-based homogeneity features into the metrics considered relies on an implicit representation of these features, which is one of the contributions of this work. Moreover, we also introduce a way to build simple closed contours as the concatenation of two disjoint open curves. Experimental results prove that the proposed model indeed outperforms state-of-the-art minimal paths-based image segmentation approaches.",['cs.CV']
Impact of individual rater style on deep learning uncertainty in medical imaging segmentation,"While multiple studies have explored the relation between inter-rater variability and deep learning model uncertainty in medical segmentation tasks, little is known about the impact of individual rater style. This study quantifies rater style in the form of bias and consistency and explores their impacts when used to train deep learning models. Two multi-rater public datasets were used, consisting of brain multiple sclerosis lesion and spinal cord grey matter segmentation. On both datasets, results show a correlation ($R^2 = 0.60$ and $0.93$) between rater bias and deep learning uncertainty. The impact of label fusion between raters' annotations on this relationship is also explored, and we show that multi-center consensuses are more effective than single-center consensuses to reduce uncertainty, since rater style is mostly center-specific.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
A Generalized Asymmetric Dual-front Model for Active Contours and Image Segmentation,"The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a powerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain partitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the evolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi regions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the geodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi diagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric quadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the integration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving contours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour shortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away from the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity distributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image segmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed dual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",['cs.CV']
GENESIS-V2: Inferring Unordered Object Representations without Iterative Refinement,"Advances in object-centric generative models (OCGMs) have culminated in the development of a broad range of methods for unsupervised object segmentation and interpretable object-centric scene generation. These methods, however, are limited to simulated and real-world datasets with limited visual complexity. Moreover, object representations are often inferred using RNNs which do not scale well to large images or iterative refinement which avoids imposing an unnatural ordering on objects in an image but requires the a priori initialisation of a fixed number of object representations. In contrast to established paradigms, this work proposes an embedding-based approach in which embeddings of pixels are clustered in a differentiable fashion using a stochastic, non-parametric stick-breaking process. Similar to iterative refinement, this clustering procedure also leads to randomly ordered object representations, but without the need of initialising a fixed number of clusters a priori. This is used to develop a new model, GENESIS-V2, which can infer a variable number of object representations without using RNNs or iterative refinement. We show that GENESIS-V2 outperforms previous methods for unsupervised image segmentation and object-centric scene generation on established synthetic datasets as well as more complex real-world datasets.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Source-Relaxed Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation,"Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interests for its capacity to adapt a model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require the concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains. However, in practice, it is common that the source images are not available in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical imaging, for instance, when the source and target images come from different clinical sites. We propose a novel formulation for adapting segmentation networks, which relaxes such a constraint. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a domain invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be used, derived from anatomical information. Here, a class-ratio prior is learned via an auxiliary network and integrated in the form of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. We show the effectiveness of our prior-aware entropy minimization in adapting spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our method yields comparable results to several state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, even though is has access to less information, the source images being absent in the adaptation phase. Our straight-forward adaptation strategy only uses one network, contrary to popular adversarial techniques, which cannot perform without the presence of the source images. Our framework can be readily used with various priors and segmentation problems.",['cs.CV']
Analysis of Information Flow Through U-Nets,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in medical image processing and analysis. Among them, U-Nets are very popular in various image segmentation tasks. Yet, little is known about how information flows through these networks and whether they are indeed properly designed for the tasks they are being proposed for. In this paper, we employ information-theoretic tools in order to gain insight into information flow through U-Nets. In particular, we show how mutual information between input/output and an intermediate layer can be a useful tool to understand information flow through various portions of a U-Net, assess its architectural efficiency, and even propose more efficient designs.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Locate then Segment: A Strong Pipeline for Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a natural language expression. Previous methods usually focus on designing an implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask without explicitly modeling the localization information of the referent instances. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a ""Locate-Then-Segment"" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg). In addition, our model is more interpretable with explicitly locating the object, which is also proved by visualization experiments. We believe this framework is promising to serve as a strong baseline for referring image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
DiNTS: Differentiable Neural Network Topology Search for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied to automatically search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search space usually contains a network topology level (controlling connections among cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level (operations within each cell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D image datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or single-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search efficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search. Our Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme (DiNTS) is evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challenging segmentation tasks. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and the top ranking on the MSD challenge leaderboard.",['cs.CV']
Learning to Segment from Scribbles using Multi-scale Adversarial Attention Gates,"Large, fine-grained image segmentation datasets, annotated at pixel-level, are difficult to obtain, particularly in medical imaging, where annotations also require expert knowledge. Weakly-supervised learning can train models by relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn their correct position in the image. Central to the model's success is a novel attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales. Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce the vanishing gradient problem in the deeper layers of the segmentor. We evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical (PPSS) datasets, and we report performance levels matching those achieved by models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning (combining scribble and mask supervision). We release expert-made scribble annotations for the ACDC dataset, and the code used for the experiments, at https://vios-s.github.io/multiscale-adversarial-attention-gates",['cs.CV']
"Learning Deformable Image Registration from Optimization: Perspective, Modules, Bilevel Training and Beyond","Conventional deformable registration methods aim at solving an optimization model carefully designed on image pairs and their computational costs are exceptionally high. In contrast, recent deep learning based approaches can provide fast deformation estimation. These heuristic network architectures are fully data-driven and thus lack explicit geometric constraints, e.g., topology-preserving, which are indispensable to generate plausible deformations. We design a new deep learning based framework to optimize a diffeomorphic model via multi-scale propagation in order to integrate advantages and avoid limitations of these two categories of approaches. Specifically, we introduce a generic optimization model to formulate diffeomorphic registration and develop a series of learnable architectures to obtain propagative updating in the coarse-to-fine feature space. Moreover, we propose a novel bilevel self-tuned training strategy, allowing efficient search of task-specific hyper-parameters. This training strategy increases the flexibility to various types of data while reduces computational and human burdens. We conduct two groups of image registration experiments on 3D volume datasets including image-to-atlas registration on brain MRI data and image-to-image registration on liver CT data. Extensive results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method with diffeomorphic guarantee and extreme efficiency. We also apply our framework to challenging multi-modal image registration, and investigate how our registration to support the down-streaming tasks for medical image analysis including multi-modal fusion and image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Interior Object Detection and Color Harmonization,"Confused about renovating your space? Choosing the perfect color for your walls is always a challenging task. One does rounds of color consultation and several patch tests. This paper proposes an AI tool to pitch paint based on attributes of your room and other furniture, and visualize it on your walls. It makes the color selection process easy. It takes in images of a room, detects furniture objects using YOLO object detection. Once these objects have been detected, the tool picks out color of the object. Later this object specific information gets appended to the room attributes (room_type, room_size, preferred_tone, etc) and a deep neural net is trained to make predictions for color/texture/wallpaper for the walls. Finally, these predictions are visualized on the walls from the images provided. The idea is to take the knowledge of a color consultant and pitch colors that suit the walls and provide a good contrast with the furniture and harmonize with different colors in the room. Transfer learning for YOLO object detection from the COCO dataset was used as a starting point and the weights were later fine-tuned by training on additional images. The model was trained on 1000 records listing the room and furniture attributes, to predict colors. Given the room image, this method finds the best color scheme for the walls. These predictions are then visualized on the walls in the image using image segmentation. The results are visually appealing and automatically enhance the color look-and-feel.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
A Location-Sensitive Local Prototype Network for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"Despite the tremendous success of deep neural networks in medical image segmentation, they typically require a large amount of costly, expert-level annotated data. Few-shot segmentation approaches address this issue by learning to transfer knowledge from limited quantities of labeled examples. Incorporating appropriate prior knowledge is critical in designing high-performance few-shot segmentation algorithms. Since strong spatial priors exist in many medical imaging modalities, we propose a prototype-based method -- namely, the location-sensitive local prototype network -- that leverages spatial priors to perform few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach divides the difficult problem of segmenting the entire image with global prototypes into easily solvable subproblems of local region segmentation with local prototypes. For organ segmentation experiments on the VISCERAL CT image dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 10% in the mean Dice coefficient. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the substantial benefits of incorporating spatial information and confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",['cs.CV']
Margin Preserving Self-paced Contrastive Learning Towards Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation,"To bridge the gap between the source and target domains in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the most common strategy puts focus on matching the marginal distributions in the feature space through adversarial learning. However, such category-agnostic global alignment lacks of exploiting the class-level joint distributions, causing the aligned distribution less discriminative. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel margin preserving self-paced contrastive Learning (MPSCL) model for cross-modal medical image segmentation. Unlike the conventional construction of contrastive pairs in contrastive learning, the domain-adaptive category prototypes are utilized to constitute the positive and negative sample pairs. With the guidance of progressively refined semantic prototypes, a novel margin preserving contrastive loss is proposed to boost the discriminability of embedded representation space. To enhance the supervision for contrastive learning, more informative pseudo-labels are generated in target domain in a self-paced way, thus benefiting the category-aware distribution alignment for UDA. Furthermore, the domain-invariant representations are learned through joint contrastive learning between the two domains. Extensive experiments on cross-modal cardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate that MPSCL significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, and outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",['cs.CV']
A Novel CNN-LSTM-based Approach to Predict Urban Expansion,"Time-series remote sensing data offer a rich source of information that can be used in a wide range of applications, from monitoring changes in land cover to surveilling crops, coastal changes, flood risk assessment, and urban sprawl. This paper addresses the challenge of using time-series satellite images to predict urban expansion. Building upon previous work, we propose a novel two-step approach based on semantic image segmentation in order to predict urban expansion. The first step aims to extract information about urban regions at different time scales and prepare them for use in the training step. The second step combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) methods in order to learn temporal features and thus predict urban expansion. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. We empirically evaluated our proposed technique, and examined its results by comparing them with state-of-the-art approaches. Following this evaluation, we determined that our results reveal improved performance for the new-coupled CNN-LSTM approach, particularly in terms of assessments based on Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Face Mask Extraction in Video Sequence,"Inspired by the recent development of deep network-based methods in semantic image segmentation, we introduce an end-to-end trainable model for face mask extraction in video sequence. Comparing to landmark-based sparse face shape representation, our method can produce the segmentation masks of individual facial components, which can better reflect their detailed shape variations. By integrating Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) algorithm with Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), our new ConvLSTM-FCN model works on a per-sequence basis and takes advantage of the temporal correlation in video clips. In addition, we also propose a novel loss function, called Segmentation Loss, to directly optimise the Intersection over Union (IoU) performances. In practice, to further increase segmentation accuracy, one primary model and two additional models were trained to focus on the face, eyes, and mouth regions, respectively. Our experiment shows the proposed method has achieved a 16.99% relative improvement (from 54.50% to 63.76% mean IoU) over the baseline FCN model on the 300 Videos in the Wild (300VW) dataset.",['cs.CV']
EMDS-5: Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Fifth Version for Multiple Image Analysis Tasks,"Environmental Microorganism Data Set Fifth Version (EMDS-5) is a microscopic image dataset including original Environmental Microorganism (EM) images and two sets of Ground Truth (GT) images. The GT image sets include a single-object GT image set and a multi-object GT image set. The EMDS-5 dataset has 21 types of EMs, each of which contains 20 original EM images, 20 single-object GT images and 20 multi-object GT images. EMDS-5 can realize to evaluate image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, image classification and image retrieval functions. In order to prove the effectiveness of EMDS-5, for each function, we select the most representative algorithms and price indicators for testing and evaluation. The image preprocessing functions contain two parts: image denoising and image edge detection. Image denoising uses nine kinds of filters to denoise 13 kinds of noises, respectively. In the aspect of edge detection, six edge detection operators are used to detect the edges of the images, and two evaluation indicators, peak-signal to noise ratio and mean structural similarity, are used for evaluation. Image segmentation includes single-object image segmentation and multi-object image segmentation. Six methods are used for single-object image segmentation, while k-means and U-net are used for multi-object segmentation.We extract nine features from the images in EMDS-5 and use the Support Vector Machine classifier for testing. In terms of image classification, we select the VGG16 feature to test different classifiers. We test two types of retrieval approaches: texture feature retrieval and deep learning feature retrieval. We select the last layer of features of these two deep learning networks as feature vectors. We use mean average precision as the evaluation index for retrieval.",['cs.CV']
Using the Split Bregman Algorithm to Solve the Self-repelling Snake Model,"Preserving contour topology during image segmentation is useful in many practical scenarios. By keeping the contours isomorphic, it is possible to prevent over-segmentation and under-segmentation, as well as to adhere to given topologies. The Self-repelling Snake model (SR) is a variational model that preserves contour topology by combining a non-local repulsion term with the geodesic active contour model (GAC). The SR is traditionally solved using the additive operator splitting (AOS) scheme. In our paper, we propose an alternative solution to the SR using the Split Bregman method. Our algorithm breaks the problem down into simpler sub-problems to use lower-order evolution equations and a simple projection scheme rather than re-initialization. The sub-problems can be solved via fast Fourier transform (FFT) or an approximate soft thresholding formula which maintains stability, shortening the convergence time, and reduces the memory requirement. The Split Bregman and AOS algorithms are compared theoretically and experimentally.",['cs.CV']
TransUNet: Transformers Make Strong Encoders for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is an essential prerequisite for developing healthcare systems, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. On various medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which merits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image segmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the encoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to enable precise localization.   We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image segmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by recovering localized spatial information. TransUNet achieves superior performances to various competing methods on different medical applications including multi-organ segmentation and cardiac segmentation.

Co-Seg: An Image Segmentation Framework Against Label Corruption,"Supervised deep learning performance is heavily tied to the availability of high-quality labels for training. Neural networks can gradually overfit corrupted labels if directly trained on noisy datasets, leading to severe performance degradation at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely Co-Seg, to collaboratively train segmentation networks on datasets which include low-quality noisy labels. Our approach first trains two networks simultaneously to sift through all samples and obtain a subset with reliable labels. Then, an efficient yet easily-implemented label correction strategy is applied to enrich the reliable subset. Finally, using the updated dataset, we retrain the segmentation network to finalize its parameters. Experiments in two noisy labels scenarios demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve results comparable to those obtained from supervised learning trained on the noise-free labels. In addition, our framework can be easily implemented in any segmentation algorithm to increase its robustness to noisy labels.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV']"
Rethinking Interactive Image Segmentation: Feature Space Annotation,"Despite the progress of interactive image segmentation methods, high-quality pixel-level annotation is still time-consuming and laborious -- a bottleneck for several deep learning applications. We take a step back to propose interactive and simultaneous segment annotation from multiple images guided by feature space projection and optimized by metric learning as the labeling progresses. This strategy is in stark contrast to existing interactive segmentation methodologies, which perform annotation in the image domain. We show that our approach can surpass the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods in foreground segmentation datasets: iCoSeg, DAVIS, and Rooftop. Moreover, it achieves 91.5\% accuracy in a known semantic segmentation dataset, Cityscapes, being 74.75 times faster than the original annotation procedure. The appendix presents additional qualitative results. Code and video demonstration will be released upon publication.",['cs.CV']
CAKES: Channel-wise Automatic KErnel Shrinking for Efficient 3D Networks,"3D Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely applied to 3D scene understanding, such as video analysis and volumetric image recognition. However, 3D networks can easily lead to over-parameterization which incurs expensive computation cost. In this paper, we propose Channel-wise Automatic KErnel Shrinking (CAKES), to enable efficient 3D learning by shrinking standard 3D convolutions into a set of economic operations e.g., 1D, 2D convolutions. Unlike previous methods, CAKES performs channel-wise kernel shrinkage, which enjoys the following benefits: 1) enabling operations deployed in every layer to be heterogeneous, so that they can extract diverse and complementary information to benefit the learning process; and 2) allowing for an efficient and flexible replacement design, which can be generalized to both spatial-temporal and volumetric data. Further, we propose a new search space based on CAKES, so that the replacement configuration can be determined automatically for simplifying 3D networks. CAKES shows superior performance to other methods with similar model size, and it also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art with much fewer parameters and computational costs on tasks including 3D medical imaging segmentation and video action recognition.

Domain Adaptation on Semantic Segmentation for Aerial Images,"Semantic segmentation has achieved significant advances in recent years. While deep neural networks perform semantic segmentation well, their success rely on pixel level supervision which is expensive and time-consuming. Further, training using data from one domain may not generalize well to data from a new domain due to a domain gap between data distributions in the different domains. This domain gap is particularly evident in aerial images where visual appearance depends on the type of environment imaged, season, weather, and time of day when the environment is imaged. Subsequently, this distribution gap leads to severe accuracy loss when using a pretrained segmentation model to analyze new data with different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework to address domain shift in the context of aerial semantic image segmentation. To this end, we solve the problem of domain shift by learn the soft label distribution difference between the source and target domains. Further, we also apply entropy minimization on the target domain to produce high-confident prediction rather than using high-confident prediction by pseudo-labeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our domain adaptation framework using the challenge image segmentation dataset of ISPRS, and show improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of various metrics.",['cs.CV']
Morphological Network: How Far Can We Go with Morphological Neurons?,"In recent years, the idea of using morphological operations as networks has received much attention. Mathematical morphology provides very efficient and useful image processing and image analysis tools based on basic operators like dilation and erosion, defined in terms of kernels. Many other morphological operations are built up using the dilation and erosion operations. Although the learning of structuring elements such as dilation or erosion using the backpropagation algorithm is not new, the order and the way these morphological operations are used is not standard. In this paper, we have theoretically analyzed the use of morphological operations for processing 1D feature vectors and shown that this gets extended to the 2D case in a simple manner. Our theoretical results show that a morphological block represents a sum of hinge functions. Hinge functions are used in many places for classification and regression tasks (Breiman (1993)). We have also proved a universal approximation theorem -- a stack of two morphological blocks can approximate any continuous function over arbitrary compact sets. To experimentally validate the efficacy of this network in real-life applications, we have evaluated its performance on satellite image classification datasets since morphological operations are very sensitive to geometrical shapes and structures. We have also shown results on a few tasks like segmentation of blood vessels from fundus images, segmentation of lungs from chest x-ray and image dehazing. The results are encouraging and further establishes the potential of morphological networks.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']"
Vox2Vox: 3D-GAN for Brain Tumour Segmentation,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histological sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumour core. Although brain tumours can easily be detected using multi-modal MRI, accurate tumor segmentation is a challenging task. Hence, using the data provided by the BraTS Challenge 2020, we propose a 3D volume-to-volume Generative Adversarial Network for segmentation of brain tumours. The model, called Vox2Vox, generates realistic segmentation outputs from multi-channel 3D MR images, segmenting the whole, core and enhancing tumor with mean values of 87.20%, 81.14%, and 78.67% as dice scores and 6.44mm, 24.36mm, and 18.95mm for Hausdorff distance 95 percentile for the BraTS testing set after ensembling 10 Vox2Vox models obtained with a 10-fold cross-validation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
"Disentangle, align and fuse for multimodal and semi-supervised image segmentation","Magnetic resonance (MR) protocols rely on several sequences to assess pathology and organ status properly. Despite advances in image analysis, we tend to treat each sequence, here termed modality, in isolation. Taking advantage of the common information shared between modalities (an organ's anatomy) is beneficial for multi-modality processing and learning. However, we must overcome inherent anatomical misregistrations and disparities in signal intensity across the modalities to obtain this benefit. We present a method that offers improved segmentation accuracy of the modality of interest (over a single input model), by learning to leverage information present in other modalities, even if few (semi-supervised) or no (unsupervised) annotations are available for this specific modality. Core to our method is learning a disentangled decomposition into anatomical and imaging factors. Shared anatomical factors from the different inputs are jointly processed and fused to extract more accurate segmentation masks. Image misregistrations are corrected with a Spatial Transformer Network, which non-linearly aligns the anatomical factors. The imaging factor captures signal intensity characteristics across different modality data and is used for image reconstruction, enabling semi-supervised learning. Temporal and slice pairing between inputs are learned dynamically. We demonstrate applications in Late Gadolinium Enhanced (LGE) and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) cardiac segmentation, as well as in T2 abdominal segmentation.

Color Image Segmentation Metrics,"An automatic image segmentation procedure is an inevitable part of many image analyses and computer vision which deeply affect the rest of the system; therefore, a set of interactive segmentation evaluation methods can substantially simplify the system development process. This entry presents the state of the art of quantitative evaluation metrics for color image segmentation methods by performing an analytical and comparative review of the measures. The decision-making process in selecting a suitable evaluation metric is still very serious because each metric tends to favor a different segmentation method for each benchmark dataset. Furthermore, a conceptual comparison of these metrics is provided at a high level of abstraction and is discussed for understanding the quantitative changes in different image segmentation results.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MM', 'eess.IV']"
Human Perception-based Evaluation Criterion for Ultra-high Resolution Cell Membrane Segmentation,"Computer vision technology is widely used in biological and medical data analysis and understanding. However, there are still two major bottlenecks in the field of cell membrane segmentation, which seriously hinder further research: lack of sufficient high-quality data and lack of suitable evaluation criteria. In order to solve these two problems, this paper first proposes an Ultra-high Resolution Image Segmentation dataset for the Cell membrane, called U-RISC, the largest annotated Electron Microscopy (EM) dataset for the Cell membrane with multiple iterative annotations and uncompressed high-resolution raw data. During the analysis process of the U-RISC, we found that the current popular segmentation evaluation criteria are inconsistent with human perception. This interesting phenomenon is confirmed by a subjective experiment involving twenty people. Furthermore, to resolve this inconsistency, we propose a new evaluation criterion called Perceptual Hausdorff Distance (PHD) to measure the quality of cell membrane segmentation results. Detailed performance comparison and discussion of classic segmentation methods along with two iterative manual annotation results under existing evaluation criteria and PHD is given.",['cs.CV']
Referring Image Segmentation via Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension,"Referring image segmentation aims at segmenting the foreground masks of the entities that can well match the description given in the natural language expression. Previous approaches tackle this problem using implicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic modalities, but usually fail to explore informative words of the expression to well align features from the two modalities for accurately identifying the referred entity. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension (CMPC) module and a Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to effectively address the challenging task. Concretely, the CMPC module first employs entity and attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the correct entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by multimodal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC module, we further leverage a simple yet effective TGFE module to integrate the reasoned multimodal features from different levels with the guidance of textual information. In this way, features from multi-levels could communicate with each other and be refined based on the textual context. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular referring segmentation benchmarks and achieve new state-of-the-art performances.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CL']"
Learning to segment microscopy images with lazy labels,"The need for labour intensive pixel-wise annotation is a major limitation of many fully supervised learning methods for segmenting bioimages that can contain numerous object instances with thin separations. In this paper, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network for microscopy image segmentation. Annotation issues are circumvented by letting the network being trainable on coarse labels combined with only a very small number of images with pixel-wise annotations. We call this new labelling strategy `lazy' labels. Image segmentation is stratified into three connected tasks: rough inner region detection, object separation and pixel-wise segmentation. These tasks are learned in an end-to-end multi-task learning framework. The method is demonstrated on two microscopy datasets, where we show that the model gives accurate segmentation results even if exact boundary labels are missing for a majority of annotated data. It brings more flexibility and efficiency for training deep neural networks that are data hungry and is applicable to biomedical images with poor contrast at the object boundaries or with diverse textures and repeated patterns.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Contour Sparse Representation with SDD Features for Object Recognition,"Slope difference distribution (SDD) is computed for the one-dimensional curve. It is not only robust to calculate the partitioning point to separate the curve logically, but also robust to calculate the clustering center of each part of the separated curve. SDD has been proposed for image segmentation and it outperforms all existing image segmentation methods. For verification purpose, we have made the Matlab codes of comparing SDD method with existing image segmentation methods freely available at Matlab Central. The contour of the object is similar to the histogram of the image. Thus, feature detection by SDD from the contour of the object is also feasible. In this letter, SDD features are defined and they form the sparse representation of the object contour. The reference model of each object is built based on the SDD features and then model matching is used for on line object recognition. The experimental results are very encouraging. For the gesture recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for two public datasets: the NUS dataset and the near-infrared dataset. For the object recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for the Kimia 99 dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
MCU-Net: A framework towards uncertainty representations for decision support system patient referrals in healthcare contexts,"Incorporating a human-in-the-loop system when deploying automated decision support is critical in healthcare contexts to create trust, as well as provide reliable performance on a patient-to-patient basis. Deep learning methods while having high performance, do not allow for this patient-centered approach due to the lack of uncertainty representation. Thus, we present a framework of uncertainty representation evaluated for medical image segmentation, using MCU-Net which combines a U-Net with Monte Carlo Dropout, evaluated with four different uncertainty metrics. The framework augments this by adding a human-in-the-loop aspect based on an uncertainty threshold for automated referral of uncertain cases to a medical professional. We demonstrate that MCU-Net combined with epistemic uncertainty and an uncertainty threshold tuned for this application maximizes automated performance on an individual patient level, yet refers truly uncertain cases. This is a step towards uncertainty representations when deploying machine learning based decision support in healthcare settings.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
A Neural Markovian Multiresolution Image Labeling Algorithm,"This paper describes the results of formally evaluating the MCV (Markov concurrent vision) image labeling algorithm which is a (semi-) hierarchical algorithm commencing with a partition made up of single pixel regions and merging regions or subsets of regions using a Markov random field (MRF) image model. It is an example of a general approach to computer vision called concurrent vision in which the operations of image segmentation and image classification are carried out concurrently. While many image labeling algorithms output a single partition, or segmentation, the MCV algorithm outputs a sequence of partitions and this more elaborate structure may provide information that is valuable for higher level vision systems. With certain types of MRF the component of the system for image evaluation can be implemented as a hardwired feed forward neural network. While being applicable to images (i.e. 2D signals), the algorithm is equally applicable to 1D signals (e.g. speech) or 3D signals (e.g. video sequences) (though its performance in such domains remains to be tested). The algorithm is assessed using subjective and objective criteria with very good results.",['cs.CV']
Image segmentation via Cellular Automata,"In this paper, we propose a new approach for building cellular automata to solve real-world segmentation problems. We design and train a cellular automaton that can successfully segment high-resolution images. We consider a colony that densely inhabits the pixel grid, and all cells are governed by a randomized update that uses the current state, the color, and the state of the $3\times 3$ neighborhood. The space of possible rules is defined by a small neural network. The update rule is applied repeatedly in parallel to a large random subset of cells and after convergence is used to produce segmentation masks that are then back-propagated to learn the optimal update rules using standard gradient descent methods. We demonstrate that such models can be learned efficiently with only limited trajectory length and that they show remarkable ability to organize the information to produce a globally consistent segmentation result, using only local information exchange. From a practical perspective, our approach allows us to build very efficient models -- our smallest automaton uses less than 10,000 parameters to solve complex segmentation tasks.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
ATSO: Asynchronous Teacher-Student Optimization for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"In medical image analysis, semi-supervised learning is an effective method to extract knowledge from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. This paper focuses on a popular pipeline known as self learning, and points out a weakness named lazy learning that refers to the difficulty for a model to learn from the pseudo labels generated by itself. To alleviate this issue, we propose ATSO, an asynchronous version of teacher-student optimization. ATSO partitions the unlabeled data into two subsets and alternately uses one subset to fine-tune the model and updates the label on the other subset. We evaluate ATSO on two popular medical image segmentation datasets and show its superior performance in various semi-supervised settings. With slight modification, ATSO transfers well to natural image segmentation for autonomous driving data.",['cs.CV']
Scribble-based Domain Adaptation via Co-segmentation,"Although deep convolutional networks have reached state-of-the-art performance in many medical image segmentation tasks, they have typically demonstrated poor generalisation capability. To be able to generalise from one domain (e.g. one imaging modality) to another, domain adaptation has to be performed. While supervised methods may lead to good performance, they require to fully annotate additional data which may not be an option in practice. In contrast, unsupervised methods don't need additional annotations but are usually unstable and hard to train. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised method. Instead of requiring detailed but time-consuming annotations, scribbles on the target domain are used to perform domain adaptation. This paper introduces a new formulation of domain adaptation based on structured learning and co-segmentation. Our method is easy to train, thanks to the introduction of a regularised loss. The framework is validated on Vestibular Schwannoma segmentation (T1 to T2 scans). Our proposed method outperforms unsupervised approaches and achieves comparable performance to a fully-supervised approach.",['cs.CV']
Deep learning for image segmentation: veritable or overhyped?,"Deep learning has achieved great success as a powerful classification tool and also made great progress in sematic segmentation. As a result, many researchers also believe that deep learning is the most powerful tool for pixel level image segmentation. Could deep learning achieve the same pixel level accuracy as traditional image segmentation techniques by mapping the features of the object into a non-linear function? This paper gives a short survey of the accuracies achieved by deep learning so far in image classification and image segmentation. Compared to the high accuracies achieved by deep learning in classifying limited categories in international vision challenges, the image segmentation accuracies achieved by deep learning in the same challenges are only about eighty percent. On the contrary, the image segmentation accuracies achieved in international biomedical challenges are close to ninty five percent. Why the difference is so big? Since the accuracies of the competitors methods are only evaluated based on their submitted results instead of reproducing the results by submitting the source codes or the software, are the achieved accuracies verifiable or overhyped? We are going to find it out by analyzing the working principle of deep learning. Finally, we compared the accuracies of state of the art deep learning methods with a threshold selection method quantitatively. Experimental results showed that the threshold selection method could achieve significantly higher accuracy than deep learning methods in image segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Globally Optimal Segmentation of Mutually Interacting Surfaces using Deep Learning,"Segmentation of multiple surfaces in medical images is a challenging problem, further complicated by the frequent presence of weak boundary and mutual influence between adjacent objects. The traditional graph-based optimal surface segmentation method has proven its effectiveness with its ability of capturing various surface priors in a uniform graph model. However, its efficacy heavily relies on handcrafted features that are used to define the surface cost for the ""goodness"" of a surface. Recently, deep learning (DL) is emerging as powerful tools for medical image segmentation thanks to its superior feature learning capability. Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of training data in medical imaging, it is nontrivial for DL networks to implicitly learn the global structure of the target surfaces, including surface interactions. In this work, we propose to parameterize the surface cost functions in the graph model and leverage DL to learn those parameters. The multiple optimal surfaces are then simultaneously detected by minimizing the total surface cost while explicitly enforcing the mutual surface interaction constraints. The optimization problem is solved by the primal-dual Internal Point Method, which can be implemented by a layer of neural networks, enabling efficient end-to-end training of the whole network. Experiments on Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) retinal layer segmentation and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) vessel wall segmentation demonstrated very promising results. All source code is public to facilitate further research at this direction.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Shape-aware Semi-supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation for Medical Images,"Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention in medical image segmentation due to challenges in acquiring pixel-wise image annotations, which is a crucial step for building high-performance deep learning methods. Most existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches either tend to neglect geometric constraint in object segments, leading to incomplete object coverage, or impose strong shape prior that requires extra alignment. In this work, we propose a novel shapeaware semi-supervised segmentation strategy to leverage abundant unlabeled data and to enforce a geometric shape constraint on the segmentation output. To achieve this, we develop a multi-task deep network that jointly predicts semantic segmentation and signed distance map(SDM) of object surfaces. During training, we introduce an adversarial loss between the predicted SDMs of labeled and unlabeled data so that our network is able to capture shape-aware features more effectively. Experiments on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches with improved shape estimation, which validates its efficacy. Code is available at https://github.com/kleinzcy/SASSnet.",['cs.CV']
Naive-Student: Leveraging Semi-Supervised Learning in Video Sequences for Urban Scene Segmentation,"Supervised learning in large discriminative models is a mainstay for modern computer vision. Such an approach necessitates investing in large-scale human-annotated datasets for achieving state-of-the-art results. In turn, the efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large, yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8% PQ, 42.6% AP, and 85.2% mIOU on the test set. We view this work as a notable step towards building a simple procedure to harness unlabeled video sequences and extra images to surpass state-of-the-art performance on core computer vision tasks.",['cs.CV']
Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for Image Segmentation Based on Mumford-Shah Functional,"As the resolution of digital images increase significantly, the processing of images becomes more challenging in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we consider image segmentation by solving a partial differentiation equation (PDE) model based on the Mumford-Shah functional. We develop a new algorithm by combining anisotropic mesh adaptation for image representation and finite element method for solving the PDE model. Comparing to traditional algorithms solved by finite difference method, our algorithm provides faster and better results without the need to resizing the images to lower quality. We also extend the algorithm to segment images with multiple regions.",['cs.CV']
An Uncertainty-based Human-in-the-loop System for Industrial Tool Wear Analysis,"Convolutional neural networks have shown to achieve superior performance on image segmentation tasks. However, convolutional neural networks, operating as black-box systems, generally do not provide a reliable measure about the confidence of their decisions. This leads to various problems in industrial settings, amongst others, inadequate levels of trust from users in the model's outputs as well as a non-compliance with current policy guidelines (e.g., EU AI Strategy). To address these issues, we use uncertainty measures based on Monte-Carlo dropout in the context of a human-in-the-loop system to increase the system's transparency and performance. In particular, we demonstrate the benefits described above on a real-world multi-class image segmentation task of wear analysis in the machining industry. Following previous work, we show that the quality of a prediction correlates with the model's uncertainty. Additionally, we demonstrate that a multiple linear regression using the model's uncertainties as independent variables significantly explains the quality of a prediction (\(R^2=0.718\)). Within the uncertainty-based human-in-the-loop system, the multiple regression aims at identifying failed predictions on an image-level. The system utilizes a human expert to label these failed predictions manually. A simulation study demonstrates that the uncertainty-based human-in-the-loop system increases performance for different levels of human involvement in comparison to a random-based human-in-the-loop system. To ensure generalizability, we show that the presented approach achieves similar results on the publicly available Cityscapes dataset.",['cs.CV']
Robust Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions by means of Fast Video-Sequence Segmentation,"Computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation perform very well in good weather conditions, but if the weather turns bad, they have problems to achieve this performance in these conditions. One possibility to obtain more robust and reliable results in adverse weather conditions is to use video-segmentation approaches instead of commonly used single-image segmentation methods. Video-segmentation approaches capture temporal information of the previous video-frames in addition to current image information, and hence, they are more robust against disturbances, especially if they occur in only a few frames of the video-sequence. However, video-segmentation approaches, which are often based on recurrent neural networks, cannot be applied in real-time applications anymore, since their recurrent structures in the network are computational expensive. For instance, the inference time of the LSTM-ICNet, in which recurrent units are placed at proper positions in the single-segmentation approach ICNet, increases up to 61 percent compared to the basic ICNet. Hence, in this work, the LSTM-ICNet is sped up by modifying the recurrent units of the network so that it becomes real-time capable again. Experiments on different datasets and various weather conditions show that the inference time can be decreased by about 23 percent by these modifications, while they achieve similar performance than the LSTM-ICNet and outperform the single-segmentation approach enormously in adverse weather conditions.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Interactive Deep Refinement Network for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning techniques have successfully been employed in numerous computer vision tasks including image segmentation. The techniques have also been applied to medical image segmentation, one of the most critical tasks in computer-aided diagnosis. Compared with natural images, the medical image is a gray-scale image with low-contrast (even with some invisible parts). Because some organs have similar intensity and texture with neighboring organs, there is usually a need to refine automatic segmentation results. In this paper, we propose an interactive deep refinement framework to improve the traditional semantic segmentation networks such as U-Net and fully convolutional network. In the proposed framework, we added a refinement network to traditional segmentation network to refine the segmentation results.Experimental results with public dataset revealed that the proposed method could achieve higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Learning pose variations within shape population by constrained mixtures of factor analyzers,"Mining and learning the shape variability of underlying population has benefited the applications including parametric shape modeling, 3D animation, and image segmentation. The current statistical shape modeling method works well on learning unstructured shape variations without obvious pose changes (relative rotations of the body parts). Studying the pose variations within a shape population involves segmenting the shapes into different articulated parts and learning the transformations of the segmented parts. This paper formulates the pose learning problem as mixtures of factor analyzers. The segmentation is obtained by components posterior probabilities and the rotations in pose variations are learned by the factor loading matrices. To guarantee that the factor loading matrices are composed by rotation matrices, constraints are imposed and the corresponding closed form optimal solution is derived. Based on the proposed method, the pose variations are automatically learned from the given shape populations. The method is applied in motion animation where new poses are generated by interpolating the existing poses in the training set. The obtained results are smooth and realistic.","['cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
MSDU-net: A Multi-Scale Dilated U-net for Blur Detection,"Blur detection is the separation of blurred and clear regions of an image, which is an important and challenging task in computer vision. In this work, we regard blur detection as an image segmentation problem. Inspired by the success of the U-net architecture for image segmentation, we design a Multi-Scale Dilated convolutional neural network based on U-net, which we call MSDU-net. The MSDU-net uses a group of multi-scale feature extractors with dilated convolutions to extract texture information at different scales. The U-shape architecture of the MSDU-net fuses the different-scale texture features and generates a semantic feature which allows us to achieve better results on the blur detection task. We show that using the MSDU-net we are able to outperform other state of the art blur detection methods on two publicly available benchmarks.",['cs.CV']
Bayesian optimization for modular black-box systems with switching costs,"Most existing black-box optimization methods assume that all variables in the system being optimized have equal cost and can change freely at each iteration. However, in many real world systems, inputs are passed through a sequence of different operations or modules, making variables in earlier stages of processing more costly to update. Such structure imposes a cost on switching variables in early parts of a data processing pipeline. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for switch cost-aware optimization called Lazy Modular Bayesian Optimization (LaMBO). This method efficiently identifies the global optimum while minimizing cost through a passive change of variables in early modules. The method is theoretical grounded and achieves vanishing regret when augmented with switching cost. We apply LaMBO to multiple synthetic functions and a three-stage image segmentation pipeline used in a neuroscience application, where we obtain promising improvements over prevailing cost-aware Bayesian optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that LaMBO is an effective strategy for black-box optimization that is capable of minimizing switching costs in modular systems.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Critical Assessment of Transfer Learning for Medical Image Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Networks,"Transfer learning is widely used for training machine learning models. Here, we study the role of transfer learning for training fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for medical image segmentation. Our experiments show that although transfer learning reduces the training time on the target task, the improvement in segmentation accuracy is highly task/data-dependent. Larger improvements in accuracy are observed when the segmentation task is more challenging and the target training data is smaller. We observe that convolutional filters of an FCN change little during training for medical image segmentation, and still look random at convergence. We further show that quite accurate FCNs can be built by freezing the encoder section of the network at random values and only training the decoder section. At least for medical image segmentation, this finding challenges the common belief that the encoder section needs to learn data/task-specific representations. We examine the evolution of FCN representations to gain a better insight into the effects of transfer learning on the training dynamics. Our analysis shows that although FCNs trained via transfer learning learn different representations than FCNs trained with random initialization, the variability among FCNs trained via transfer learning can be as high as that among FCNs trained with random initialization. Moreover, feature reuse is not restricted to the early encoder layers; rather, it can be more significant in deeper layers. These findings offer new insights and suggest alternative ways of training FCNs for medical image segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Super-BPD: Super Boundary-to-Pixel Direction for Fast Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation is a fundamental vision task and a crucial step for many applications. In this paper, we propose a fast image segmentation method based on a novel super boundary-to-pixel direction (super-BPD) and a customized segmentation algorithm with super-BPD. Precisely, we define BPD on each pixel as a two-dimensional unit vector pointing from its nearest boundary to the pixel. In the BPD, nearby pixels from different regions have opposite directions departing from each other, and adjacent pixels in the same region have directions pointing to the other or each other (i.e., around medial points). We make use of such property to partition an image into super-BPDs, which are novel informative superpixels with robust direction similarity for fast grouping into segmentation regions. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500 and Pascal Context demonstrate the accuracy and efficency of the proposed super-BPD in segmenting images. In practice, the proposed super-BPD achieves comparable or superior performance with MCG while running at ~25fps vs. 0.07fps. Super-BPD also exhibits a noteworthy transferability to unseen scenes. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JianqiangWan/Super-BPD.",['cs.CV']
Deep Learning-Based Automated Image Segmentation for Concrete Petrographic Analysis,"The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete (ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase composition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized equipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the task can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation, additional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved unprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete segmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong potential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in model training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the color-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy to human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere seconds.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Semi-supervised few-shot learning for medical image segmentation,"Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on semantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training high-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks, which can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training such models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting. Recent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have developed training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which addresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled examples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which represent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very small labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made available at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to include surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals --derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that including unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more powerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better generability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in the task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets. Furthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined with different deep architectures.",['cs.CV']
CNN in CT Image Segmentation: Beyound Loss Function for Expoliting Ground Truth Images,"Exploiting more information from ground truth (GT) images now is a new research direction for further improving CNN's performance in CT image segmentation. Previous methods focus on devising the loss function for fulfilling such a purpose. However, it is rather difficult to devise a general and optimization-friendly loss function. We here present a novel and practical method that exploits GT images beyond the loss function. Our insight is that feature maps of two CNNs trained respectively on GT and CT images should be similar on some metric space, because they both are used to describe the same objects for the same purpose. We hence exploit GT images by enforcing such two CNNs' feature maps to be consistent. We assess the proposed method on two data sets, and compare its performance to several competitive methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is effective, outperforming all the compared methods.",['cs.CV']
A Fast Fully Octave Convolutional Neural Network for Document Image Segmentation,"The Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) are worldwide practices to online customer identification based on personal identification documents, similarity and liveness checking, and proof of address. To answer the basic regulation question: are you whom you say you are? The customer needs to upload valid identification documents (ID). This task imposes some computational challenges since these documents are diverse, may present different and complex backgrounds, some occlusion, partial rotation, poor quality, or damage. Advanced text and document segmentation algorithms were used to process the ID images. In this context, we investigated a method based on U-Net to detect the document edges and text regions in ID images. Besides the promising results on image segmentation, the U-Net based approach is computationally expensive for a real application, since the image segmentation is a customer device task. We propose a model optimization based on Octave Convolutions to qualify the method to situations where storage, processing, and time resources are limited, such as in mobile and robotic applications. We conducted the evaluation experiments in two new datasets CDPhotoDataset and DTDDataset, which are composed of real ID images of Brazilian documents. Our results showed that the proposed models are efficient to document segmentation tasks and portable.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
CRNet: Cross-Reference Networks for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Over the past few years, state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are based on deep convolutional neural networks. To render a deep network with the ability to understand a concept, humans need to collect a large amount of pixel-level annotated data to train the models, which is time-consuming and tedious. Recently, few-shot segmentation is proposed to solve this problem. Few-shot segmentation aims to learn a segmentation model that can be generalized to novel classes with only a few training images. In this paper, we propose a cross-reference network (CRNet) for few-shot segmentation. Unlike previous works which only predict the mask in the query image, our proposed model concurrently make predictions for both the support image and the query image. With a cross-reference mechanism, our network can better find the co-occurrent objects in the two images, thus helping the few-shot segmentation task. We also develop a mask refinement module to recurrently refine the prediction of the foreground regions. For the $k$-shot learning, we propose to finetune parts of networks to take advantage of multiple labeled support images. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance.",['cs.CV']
LT-Net: Label Transfer by Learning Reversible Voxel-wise Correspondence for One-shot Medical Image Segmentation,"We introduce a one-shot segmentation method to alleviate the burden of manual annotation for medical images. The main idea is to treat one-shot segmentation as a classical atlas-based segmentation problem, where voxel-wise correspondence from the atlas to the unlabelled data is learned. Subsequently, segmentation label of the atlas can be transferred to the unlabelled data with the learned correspondence. However, since ground truth correspondence between images is usually unavailable, the learning system must be well-supervised to avoid mode collapse and convergence failure. To overcome this difficulty, we resort to the forward-backward consistency, which is widely used in correspondence problems, and additionally learn the backward correspondences from the warped atlases back to the original atlas. This cycle-correspondence learning design enables a variety of extra, cycle-consistency-based supervision signals to make the training process stable, while also boost the performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over both deep learning-based one-shot segmentation methods and a classical multi-atlas segmentation method via thorough experiments.",['cs.CV']
Towards Interpretable Semantic Segmentation via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping,"Convolutional neural networks have become state-of-the-art in a wide range of image recognition tasks.

Whereas various interpretation methods have been suggested for image classification, the interpretation of image segmentation still remains largely unexplored. To that end, we propose SEG-GRAD-CAM, a gradient-based method for interpreting semantic segmentation. Our method is an extension of the widely-used Grad-CAM method, applied locally to produce heatmaps showing the relevance of individual pixels for semantic segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Neural arbitrary style transfer for portrait images using the attention mechanism,"Arbitrary style transfer is the task of synthesis of an image that has never been seen before, using two given images: content image and style image. The content image forms the structure, the basic geometric lines and shapes of the resulting image, while the style image sets the color and texture of the result. The word ""arbitrary"" in this context means the absence of any one pre-learned style. So, for example, convolutional neural networks capable of transferring a new style only after training or retraining on a new amount of data are not con-sidered to solve such a problem, while networks based on the attention mech-anism that are capable of performing such a transformation without retraining - yes. An original image can be, for example, a photograph, and a style image can be a painting of a famous artist. The resulting image in this case will be the scene depicted in the original photograph, made in the stylie of this picture. Recent arbitrary style transfer algorithms make it possible to achieve good re-sults in this task, however, in processing portrait images of people, the result of such algorithms is either unacceptable due to excessive distortion of facial features, or weakly expressed, not bearing the characteristic features of a style image. In this paper, we consider an approach to solving this problem using the combined architecture of deep neural networks with a attention mechanism that transfers style based on the contents of a particular image segment: with a clear predominance of style over the form for the background part of the im-age, and with the prevalence of content over the form in the image part con-taining directly the image of a person.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Residual-Sparse Fuzzy $C$-Means Clustering Incorporating Morphological Reconstruction and Wavelet frames,"Instead of directly utilizing an observed image including some outliers, noise or intensity inhomogeneity, the use of its ideal value (e.g. noise-free image) has a favorable impact on clustering. Hence, the accurate estimation of the residual (e.g. unknown noise) between the observed image and its ideal value is an important task. To do so, we propose an $\ell_0$ regularization-based Fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm incorporating a morphological reconstruction operation and a tight wavelet frame transform. To achieve a sound trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression, morphological reconstruction is used to filter an observed image. By combining the observed and filtered images, a weighted sum image is generated. Since a tight wavelet frame system has sparse representations of an image, it is employed to decompose the weighted sum image, thus forming its corresponding feature set. Taking it as data for clustering, we present an improved FCM algorithm by imposing an $\ell_0$ regularization term on the residual between the feature set and its ideal value, which implies that the favorable estimation of the residual is obtained and the ideal value participates in clustering. Spatial information is also introduced into clustering since it is naturally encountered in image segmentation. Furthermore, it makes the estimation of the residual more reliable. To further enhance the segmentation effects of the improved FCM algorithm, we also employ the morphological reconstruction to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based on the prototypes and smoothed labels, the segmented image is reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Experimental results reported for synthetic, medical, and color images show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms other algorithms.",['cs.CV']
Dual Convolutional LSTM Network for Referring Image Segmentation,"We consider referring image segmentation. It is a problem at the intersection of computer vision and natural language understanding. Given an input image and a referring expression in the form of a natural language sentence, the goal is to segment the object of interest in the image referred by the linguistic query. To this end, we propose a dual convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network to tackle this problem. Our model consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, where ConvLSTM is used in both encoder and decoder networks to capture spatial and sequential information. The encoder network extracts visual and linguistic features for each word in the expression sentence, and adopts an attention mechanism to focus on words that are more informative in the multimodal interaction. The decoder network integrates the features generated by the encoder network at multiple levels as its input and produces the final precise segmentation mask. Experimental results on four challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior segmentation performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Self-Learning AI Framework for Skin Lesion Image Segmentation and Classification,"Image segmentation and classification are the two main fundamental steps in pattern recognition. To perform medical image segmentation or classification with deep learning models, it requires training on large image dataset with annotation. The dermoscopy images (ISIC archive) considered for this work does not have ground truth information for lesion segmentation. Performing manual labelling on this dataset is time-consuming. To overcome this issue, self-learning annotation scheme was proposed in the two-stage deep learning algorithm. The two-stage deep learning algorithm consists of U-Net segmentation model with the annotation scheme and CNN classifier model. The annotation scheme uses a K-means clustering algorithm along with merging conditions to achieve initial labelling information for training the U-Net model. The classifier models namely ResNet-50 and LeNet-5 were trained and tested on the image dataset without segmentation for comparison and with the U-Net segmentation for implementing the proposed self-learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework.

Eikonal Region-based Active Contours for Image Segmentation,"The minimal path model based on the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) has served as a fundamental tool for the applications of image segmentation and boundary detection in the passed three decades. However, the existing minimal paths-based image segmentation approaches commonly rely on the image boundary features, potentially limiting their performance in some situations. In this paper, we introduce a new variational image segmentation model based on the minimal path framework and the Eikonal PDE, where the region-based functional that defines the homogeneity criteria can be taken into account for estimating the associated geodesic paths. This is done by establishing a geodesic curve interpretation to the region-based active contour evolution problem. The image segmentation processing is carried out in an iterative manner in our approach. A crucial ingredient in each iteration is to construct an asymmetric Randers geodesic metric using a sufficiently small vector field, such that a set of geodesic paths can be tracked from the geodesic distance map which is the solution to an Eikonal PDE. The object boundary can be delineated by the concatenation of the final geodesic paths. We invoke the Finsler variant of the fast marching method to estimate the geodesic distance map, yielding an efficient implementation of the proposed Eikonal region-based active contour model. Experimental results on both of the synthetic and real images exhibit that our model indeed achieves encouraging segmentation performance.",['cs.CV']
Computing Valid p-values for Image Segmentation by Selective Inference,"Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks of computer vision. In many practical applications, it is essential to properly evaluate the reliability of individual segmentation results. In this study, we propose a novel framework to provide the statistical significance of segmentation results in the form of p-values. Specifically, we consider a statistical hypothesis test for determining the difference between the object and the background regions. This problem is challenging because the difference can be deceptively large (called segmentation bias) due to the adaptation of the segmentation algorithm to the data. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a statistical approach called selective inference, and develop a framework to compute valid p-values in which the segmentation bias is properly accounted for. Although the proposed framework is potentially applicable to various segmentation algorithms, we focus in this paper on graph cut-based and threshold-based segmentation algorithms, and develop two specific methods to compute valid p-values for the segmentation results obtained by these algorithms. We prove the theoretical validity of these two methods and demonstrate their practicality by applying them to segmentation problems for medical images.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
OASIS: One-pass aligned Atlas Set for Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Despite that deep convolutional neural networks have gained stellar performance in this challenging task, they typically rely on large labeled datasets, which have limited their extension to customized applications. By revisiting the superiority of atlas based segmentation methods, we present a new framework of One-pass aligned Atlas Set for Images Segmentation (OASIS). To address the problem of time-consuming iterative image registration used for atlas warping, the proposed method takes advantage of the power of deep learning to achieve one-pass image registration. In addition, by applying label constraint, OASIS also makes the registration process to be focused on the regions to be segmented for improving the performance of segmentation. Furthermore, instead of using image based similarity for label fusion, which can be distracted by the large background areas, we propose a novel strategy to compute the label similarity based weights for label fusion. Our experimental results on the challenging task of prostate MR image segmentation demonstrate that OASIS is able to significantly increase the segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Iteratively-Refined Interactive 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Existing automatic 3D image segmentation methods usually fail to meet the clinic use. Many studies have explored an interactive strategy to improve the image segmentation performance by iteratively incorporating user hints. However, the dynamic process for successive interactions is largely ignored. We here propose to model the dynamic process of iterative interactive image segmentation as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, it is intractable to use single-agent RL for voxel-wise prediction due to the large exploration space. To reduce the exploration space to a tractable size, we treat each voxel as an agent with a shared voxel-level behavior strategy so that it can be solved with multi-agent reinforcement learning. An additional advantage of this multi-agent model is to capture the dependency among voxels for segmentation task. Meanwhile, to enrich the information of previous segmentations, we reserve the prediction uncertainty in the state space of MDP and derive an adjustment action space leading to a more precise and finer segmentation. In addition, to improve the efficiency of exploration, we design a relative cross-entropy gain-based reward to update the policy in a constrained direction. Experimental results on various medical datasets have shown that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with the advantage of fewer interactions and a faster convergence.",['cs.CV']
FaultNet: Faulty Rail-Valves Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision,"Regular inspection of rail valves and engines is an important task to ensure the safety and efficiency of railway networks around the globe. Over the past decade, computer vision and pattern recognition based techniques have gained traction for such inspection and defect detection tasks. An automated end-to-end trained system can potentially provide a low-cost, high throughput, and cheap alternative to manual visual inspection of these components. However, such systems require a huge amount of defective images for networks to understand complex defects. In this paper, a multi-phase deep learning based technique is proposed to perform accurate fault detection of rail-valves. Our approach uses a two-step method to perform high precision image segmentation of rail-valves resulting in pixel-wise accurate segmentation. Thereafter, a computer vision technique is used to identify faulty valves. We demonstrate that the proposed approach results in improved detection performance when compared to current state-of-theart techniques used in fault detection.",['cs.CV']
Optimizing the Dice Score and Jaccard Index for Medical Image Segmentation: Theory & Practice,"The Dice score and Jaccard index are commonly used metrics for the evaluation of segmentation tasks in medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks trained for image segmentation tasks are usually optimized for (weighted) cross-entropy. This introduces an adverse discrepancy between the learning optimization objective (the loss) and the end target metric. Recent works in computer vision have proposed soft surrogates to alleviate this discrepancy and directly optimize the desired metric, either through relaxations (soft-Dice, soft-Jaccard) or submodular optimization (Lov\'asz-softmax). The aim of this study is two-fold. First, we investigate the theoretical differences in a risk minimization framework and question the existence of a weighted cross-entropy loss with weights theoretically optimized to surrogate Dice or Jaccard. Second, we empirically investigate the behavior of the aforementioned loss functions w.r.t. evaluation with Dice score and Jaccard index on five medical segmentation tasks. Through the application of relative approximation bounds, we show that all surrogates are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor, and that no optimal weighting of cross-entropy exists to approximate Dice or Jaccard measures. We validate these findings empirically and show that, while it is important to opt for one of the target metric surrogates rather than a cross-entropy-based loss, the choice of the surrogate does not make a statistical difference on a wide range of medical segmentation tasks.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
U-Time: A Fully Convolutional Network for Time Series Segmentation Applied to Sleep Staging,"Neural networks are becoming more and more popular for the analysis of physiological time-series. The most successful deep learning systems in this domain combine convolutional and recurrent layers to extract useful features to model temporal relations. Unfortunately, these recurrent models are difficult to tune and optimize. In our experience, they often require task-specific modifications, which makes them challenging to use for non-experts. We propose U-Time, a fully feed-forward deep learning approach to physiological time series segmentation developed for the analysis of sleep data. U-Time is a temporal fully convolutional network based on the U-Net architecture that was originally proposed for image segmentation. U-Time maps sequential inputs of arbitrary length to sequences of class labels on a freely chosen temporal scale. This is done by implicitly classifying every individual time-point of the input signal and aggregating these classifications over fixed intervals to form the final predictions. We evaluated U-Time for sleep stage classification on a large collection of sleep electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. In all cases, we found that U-Time reaches or outperforms current state-of-the-art deep learning models while being much more robust in the training process and without requiring architecture or hyperparameter adaptation across tasks.","['cs.LG', 'eess.SP', 'stat.ML']"
TFLMS: Large Model Support in TensorFlow by Graph Rewriting,"While accelerators such as GPUs have limited memory, deep neural networks are becoming larger and will not fit with the memory limitation of accelerators for training. We propose an approach to tackle this problem by rewriting the computational graph of a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in operations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU memory. In particular, we first revise the concept of a computational graph by defining a concrete semantics for variables in a graph. We then formally show how to derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and present rules to optimize the graph. To realize our approach, we developed a module in TensorFlow, named TFLMS. TFLMS is published as a pull request in the TensorFlow repository for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS, we were able to train ResNet-50 and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size, respectively. In particular, we were able to train 3DUNet using images of size of $192^3$ for image segmentation, which, without TFLMS, had been done only by dividing the images to smaller images, which affects the accuracy.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']"
Phase Collaborative Network for Two-Phase Medical Image Segmentation,"In real-world practice, medical images acquired in different phases possess complementary information, {\em e.g.}, radiologists often refer to both arterial and venous scans in order to make the diagnosis. However, in medical image analysis, fusing prediction from two phases is often difficult, because (i) there is a domain gap between two phases, and (ii) the semantic labels are not pixel-wise corresponded even for images scanned from the same patient. This paper studies organ segmentation in two-phase CT scans. We propose Phase Collaborative Network (PCN), an end-to-end framework that contains both generative and discriminative modules. PCN can be mathematically explained to formulate phase-to-phase and data-to-label relations jointly. Experiments are performed on a two-phase CT dataset, on which PCN outperforms the baselines working with one-phase data by a large margin, and we empirically verify that the gain comes from inter-phase collaboration. Besides, PCN transfers well to two public single-phase datasets, demonstrating its potential applications.",['cs.CV']
End-to-End Boundary Aware Networks for Medical Image Segmentation,"Fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective at representing and classifying textural information, thus transforming image intensity into output class masks that achieve semantic image segmentation. In medical image analysis, however, expert manual segmentation often relies on the boundaries of anatomical structures of interest. We propose boundary aware CNNs for medical image segmentation. Our networks are designed to account for organ boundary information, both by providing a special network edge branch and edge-aware loss terms, and they are trainable end-to-end. We validate their effectiveness on the task of brain tumor segmentation using the BraTS 2018 dataset. Our experiments reveal that our approach yields more accurate segmentation results, which makes it promising for more extensive application to medical image segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Extreme Augmentation : Can deep learning based medical image segmentation be trained using a single manually delineated scan?,"Yes, it can. Data augmentation is perhaps the oldest preprocessing step in computer vision literature. Almost every computer vision model trained on imaging data uses some form of augmentation. In this paper, we use the inter-vertebral disk segmentation task alongside a deep residual U-Net as the learning model, to explore the effectiveness of augmentation. In the extreme, we observed that a model trained on patches extracted from just one scan, with each patch augmented 50 times; achieved a Dice score of 0.73 in a validation set of 40 cases. Qualitative evaluation indicated a clinically usable segmentation algorithm, which appropriately segments regions of interest, alongside limited false positive specks. When the initial patches are extracted from nine scans the average Dice coefficient jumps to 0.86 and most of the false positives disappear. While this still falls short of state-of-the-art deep learning based segmentation of discs reported in literature, qualitative examination reveals that it does yield segmentation, which can be amended by expert clinicians with minimal effort to generate additional data for training improved deep models. Extreme augmentation of training data, should thus be construed as a strategy for training deep learning based algorithms, when very little manually annotated data is available to work with. Models trained with extreme augmentation can then be used to accelerate the generation of manually labelled data. Hence, we show that extreme augmentation can be a valuable tool in addressing scaling up small imaging data sets to address medical image segmentation tasks.",['cs.CV']
Revisiting CycleGAN for semi-supervised segmentation,"In this work, we study the problem of training deep networks for semantic image segmentation using only a fraction of annotated images, which may significantly reduce human annotation efforts. Particularly, we propose a strategy that exploits the unpaired image style transfer capabilities of CycleGAN in semi-supervised segmentation. Unlike recent works using adversarial learning for semi-supervised segmentation, we enforce cycle consistency to learn a bidirectional mapping between unpaired images and segmentation masks. This adds an unsupervised regularization effect that boosts the segmentation performance when annotated data is limited. Experiments on three different public segmentation benchmarks (PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes and ACDC) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model achieves 2-4% of improvement with respect to the baseline and outperforms recent approaches for this task, particularly in low labeled data regime.",['cs.CV']
LadderNet: Multi-path networks based on U-Net for medical image segmentation,"U-Net has been providing state-of-the-art performance in many medical image segmentation problems. Many modifications have been proposed for U-Net, such as attention U-Net, recurrent residual convolutional U-Net (R2-UNet), and U-Net with residual blocks or blocks with dense connections. However, all these modifications have an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, and the number of paths for information flow is limited. We propose LadderNet in this paper, which can be viewed as a chain of multiple U-Nets. Instead of only one pair of encoder branch and decoder branch in U-Net, a LadderNet has multiple pairs of encoder-decoder branches, and has skip connections between every pair of adjacent decoder and decoder branches in each level. Inspired by the success of ResNet and R2-UNet, we use modified residual blocks where two convolutional layers in one block share the same weights. A LadderNet has more paths for information flow because of skip connections and residual blocks, and can be viewed as an ensemble of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). The equivalence to an ensemble of FCNs improves segmentation accuracy, while the shared weights within each residual block reduce parameter number. Semantic segmentation is essential for retinal disease detection. We tested LadderNet on two benchmark datasets for blood vessel segmentation in retinal images, and achieved superior performance over methods in the literature.

Customizable Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Customizable Architecture Search (CAS) approach to automatically generate a network architecture for semantic image segmentation. The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked computation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and each edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling), which transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm explores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network. The cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights. In real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under some constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost corresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an operation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to the objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture with customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques. More remarkably, our CAS achieves 72.3% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset with speed of 108 FPS on an Nvidia TitanXp GPU.",['cs.CV']
Massively Parallel Benders Decomposition for Correlation Clustering,"We tackle the problem of graph partitioning for image segmentation using correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP). We reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our Benders decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a node in the CC instance's graph, which are solved in parallel. Each Benders subproblem enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to the negative weight edges attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows, to accelerate optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and allows for massive parallelization.",['cs.CV']
One-stage Shape Instantiation from a Single 2D Image to 3D Point Cloud,"Shape instantiation which predicts the 3D shape of a dynamic target from one or more 2D images is important for real-time intra-operative navigation. Previously, a general shape instantiation framework was proposed with manual image segmentation to generate a 2D Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and with Kernel Partial Least Square Regression (KPLSR) to learn the relationship between the 2D and 3D SSM for 3D shape prediction. In this paper, the two-stage shape instantiation is improved to be one-stage. PointOutNet with 19 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers is used as the network structure and Chamfer distance is used as the loss function to predict the 3D target point cloud from a single 2D image. With the proposed one-stage shape instantiation algorithm, a spontaneous image-to-point cloud training and inference can be achieved. A dataset from 27 Right Ventricle (RV) subjects, indicating 609 experiments, were used to validate the proposed one-stage shape instantiation algorithm. An average point cloud-to-point cloud (PC-to-PC) error of 1.72mm has been achieved, which is comparable to the PLSR-based (1.42mm) and KPLSR-based (1.31mm) two-stage shape instantiation algorithm.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Separable Convolutional LSTMs for Faster Video Segmentation,"Semantic Segmentation is an important module for autonomous robots such as self-driving cars. The advantage of video segmentation approaches compared to single image segmentation is that temporal image information is considered, and their performance increases due to this. Hence, single image segmentation approaches are extended by recurrent units such as convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) cells, which are placed at suitable positions in the basic network architecture. However, a major critique of video segmentation approaches based on recurrent neural networks is their large parameter count and their computational complexity, and so, their inference time of one video frame takes up to 66 percent longer than their basic version. Inspired by the success of the spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, we generalize these techniques for convLSTMs in this work, so that the number of parameters and the required FLOPs are reduced significantly. Experiments on different datasets show that the segmentation approaches using the proposed, modified convLSTM cells achieve similar or slightly worse accuracy, but are up to 15 percent faster on a GPU than the ones using the standard convLSTM cells. Furthermore, a new evaluation metric is introduced, which measures the amount of flickering pixels in the segmented video sequence.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Automatic 3D bi-ventricular segmentation of cardiac images by a shape-refined multi-task deep learning approach,"Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the artefacts in input CMR volumes.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Chan-Vese Reformulation for Selective Image Segmentation,"Selective segmentation involves incorporating user input to partition an image into foreground and background, by discriminating between objects of a similar type. Typically, such methods involve introducing additional constraints to generic segmentation approaches. However, we show that this is often inconsistent with respect to common assumptions about the image. The proposed method introduces a new fitting term that is more useful in practice than the Chan-Vese framework. In particular, the idea is to define a term that allows for the background to consist of multiple regions of inhomogeneity. We provide comparitive experimental results to alternative approaches to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, broadening the possible application of these methods.",['cs.CV']
A General Framework for Complex Network-Based Image Segmentation,"With the recent advances in complex networks theory, graph-based techniques for image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. In order to segment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an image segmentation general framework using complex networks based community detection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential community detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that the proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared to some existing methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
A Partially Reversible U-Net for Memory-Efficient Volumetric Image Segmentation,"One of the key drawbacks of 3D convolutional neural networks for segmentation is their memory footprint, which necessitates compromises in the network architecture in order to fit into a given memory budget. Motivated by the RevNet for image classification, we propose a partially reversible U-Net architecture that reduces memory consumption substantially. The reversible architecture allows us to exactly recover each layer's outputs from the subsequent layer's ones, eliminating the need to store activations for backpropagation. This alleviates the biggest memory bottleneck and enables very deep (theoretically infinitely deep) 3D architectures. On the BraTS challenge dataset, we demonstrate substantial memory savings. We further show that the freed memory can be used for processing the whole field-of-view (FOV) instead of patches. Increasing network depth led to higher segmentation accuracy while growing the memory footprint only by a very small fraction, thanks to the partially reversible architecture.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Learning Shape Representation on Sparse Point Clouds for Volumetric Image Segmentation,"Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images. Among these challenges are large volumes of interest, high class imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose to improve over traditional CNN-based volumetric image segmentation through point-wise classification of point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds allows processing of entire image volumes, balancing highly imbalanced segmentation problems, and explicitly learning an anatomical shape. We build upon PointCNN, a neural network proposed to process point clouds, and propose here to jointly encode shape and volumetric information within the point cloud in a compact and computationally effective manner. We demonstrate how this approach can then be used to refine CNN-based segmentation, which yields significantly improved results in our experiments on the difficult task of peripheral nerve segmentation from magnetic resonance neurography images. By synthetic experiments, we further show the capability of our approach in learning an explicit anatomical shape representation.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
End-to-End Learned Random Walker for Seeded Image Segmentation,"We present an end-to-end learned algorithm for seeded segmentation. Our method is based on the Random Walker algorithm, where we predict the edge weights of the underlying graph using a convolutional neural network. This can be interpreted as learning context-dependent diffusivities for a linear diffusion process. Besides calculating the exact gradient for optimizing these diffusivities, we also propose simplifications that sparsely sample the gradient and still yield competitive results. The proposed method achieves the currently best results on a seeded version of the CREMI neuron segmentation challenge.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Automated Segmentation of Cervical Nuclei in Pap Smear Images using Deformable Multi-path Ensemble Model,"Pap smear testing has been widely used for detecting cervical cancers based on the morphology properties of cell nuclei in microscopic image. An accurate nuclei segmentation could thus improve the success rate of cervical cancer screening. In this work, a method of automated cervical nuclei segmentation using Deformable Multipath Ensemble Model (D-MEM) is proposed. The approach adopts a U-shaped convolutional network as a backbone network, in which dense blocks are used to transfer feature information more effectively. To increase the flexibility of the model, we then use deformable convolution to deal with different nuclei irregular shapes and sizes. To reduce the predictive bias, we further construct multiple networks with different settings, which form an ensemble model. The proposed segmentation framework has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Herlev dataset with Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI) of 0.933, and has the potential to be extended for solving other medical image segmentation tasks.",['cs.CV']
Open Source Presentation Attack Detection Baseline for Iris Recognition,"This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack detection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly wearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses. This software can serve as a baseline in various PAD evaluations, and also as an open-source platform with an up-to-date reference method for iris PAD. The software is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such as OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may be problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to localize the rough position of the iris. The PAD-related features are extracted with the Binary Statistical Image Features (BSIF), which are classified by an ensemble of classifiers incorporating support vector machine, random forest and multilayer perceptron. The models attached to the current software have been trained with the NDCLD'15 database and evaluated on the independent datasets included in the LivDet-Iris 2017 competition. The software implements the functionality of retraining the classifiers with any database of authentic and attack images. The accuracy of the current version offered with this paper exceeds 99% when tested on subject-disjoint subsets of NDCLD'15, and oscillates around 85% when tested on the LivDet-Iris 2017 benchmarks, which is on par with the results obtained by the LivDet-Iris 2017 winner.",['cs.CV']
Non-Local Context Encoder: Robust Biomedical Image Segmentation against Adversarial Attacks,"Recent progress in biomedical image segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has drawn much attention. However, its vulnerability towards adversarial samples cannot be overlooked. This paper is the first one that discovers that all the CNN-based state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation models are sensitive to adversarial perturbations. This limits the deployment of these methods in safety-critical biomedical fields. In this paper, we discover that global spatial dependencies and global contextual information in a biomedical image can be exploited to defend against adversarial attacks. To this end, non-local context encoder (NLCE) is proposed to model short- and long range spatial dependencies and encode global contexts for strengthening feature activations by channel-wise attention. The NLCE modules enhance the robustness and accuracy of the non-local context encoding network (NLCEN), which learns robust enhanced pyramid feature representations with NLCE modules, and then integrates the information across different levels. Experiments on both lung and skin lesion segmentation datasets have demonstrated that NLCEN outperforms any other state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation methods against adversarial attacks. In addition, NLCE modules can be applied to improve the robustness of other CNN-based biomedical image segmentation methods.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Skin Cancer Segmentation and Classification with NABLA-N and Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Networks,"In the last few years, Deep Learning (DL) has been showing superior performance in different modalities of biomedical image analysis. Several DL architectures have been proposed for classification, segmentation, and detection tasks in medical imaging and computational pathology. In this paper, we propose a new DL architecture, the NABLA-N network, with better feature fusion techniques in decoding units for dermoscopic image segmentation tasks. The NABLA-N network has several advances for segmentation tasks. First, this model ensures better feature representation for semantic segmentation with a combination of low to high-level feature maps. Second, this network shows better quantitative and qualitative results with the same or fewer network parameters compared to other methods. In addition, the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) model is used for skin cancer classification. The proposed NABLA-N network and IRRCNN models are evaluated for skin cancer segmentation and classification on the benchmark datasets from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC-2018).

The model is an extension of recently proposed work that maps image pixels to sounds. Here, we introduce a learning approach to disentangle concepts in the neural networks, and assign semantic categories to network feature channels to enable independent image segmentation and sound source separation after audio-visual training on videos. Our evaluations show that the disentangled model outperforms several baselines in semantic segmentation and sound source separation.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Fast Single Image Dehazing via Multilevel Wavelet Transform based Optimization,"The quality of images captured in outdoor environments can be affected by poor weather conditions such as fog, dust, and atmospheric scattering of other particles. This problem can bring extra challenges to high-level computer vision tasks like image segmentation and object detection. However, previous studies on image dehazing suffer from a huge computational workload and corruption of the original image, such as over-saturation and halos. In this paper, we present a novel image dehazing approach based on the optical model for haze images and regularized optimization. Specifically, we convert the non-convex, bilinear problem concerning the unknown haze-free image and light transmission distribution to a convex, linear optimization problem by estimating the atmosphere light constant. Our method is further accelerated by introducing a multilevel Haar wavelet transform. The optimization, instead, is applied to the low frequency sub-band decomposition of the original image. This dimension reduction significantly improves the processing speed of our method and exhibits the potential for real-time applications. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms in terms of both image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network Models for Enhancing Resolution of Rock Micro-CT Images,"Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography ({\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is limited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs between resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in this study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced Deep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock Super Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of 2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and test data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared to bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB range. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in images within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise related detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution images, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to synthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering edgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model is also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image augmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown to act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances which naturally leads to further future development and training of models that segment an image directly. Image restoration by SRCNN on the rock images is of significantly higher quality than traditional methods and suggests SRCNN methods are a viable processing step in a digital rock workflow.",['cs.CV']
Cross-Modal Self-Attention Network for Referring Image Segmentation,"We consider the problem of referring image segmentation. Given an input image and a natural language expression, the goal is to segment the object referred by the language expression in the image. Existing works in this area treat the language expression and the input image separately in their representations. They do not sufficiently capture long-range correlations between these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal self-attention (CMSA) module that effectively captures the long-range dependencies between linguistic and visual features. Our model can adaptively focus on informative words in the referring expression and important regions in the input image. In addition, we propose a gated multi-level fusion module to selectively integrate self-attentive cross-modal features corresponding to different levels in the image. This module controls the information flow of features at different levels. We validate the proposed approach on four evaluation datasets. Our proposed approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CL']"
Machine Vision Guided 3D Medical Image Compression for Efficient Transmission and Accurate Segmentation in the Clouds,"Cloud based medical image analysis has become popular recently due to the high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper we will use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently. Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first machine vision guided medical image compression framework for segmentation in the clouds.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Adaptive Morphological Reconstruction for Seeded Image Segmentation,"Morphological reconstruction (MR) is often employed by seeded image segmentation algorithms such as watershed transform and power watershed as it is able to filter seeds (regional minima) to reduce over-segmentation. However, MR might mistakenly filter meaningful seeds that are required for generating accurate segmentation and it is also sensitive to the scale because a single-scale structuring element is employed. In this paper, a novel adaptive morphological reconstruction (AMR) operation is proposed that has three advantages. Firstly, AMR can adaptively filter useless seeds while preserving meaningful ones. Secondly, AMR is insensitive to the scale of structuring elements because multiscale structuring elements are employed. Finally, AMR has two attractive properties: monotonic increasingness and convergence that help seeded segmentation algorithms to achieve a hierarchical segmentation. Experiments clearly demonstrate that AMR is useful for improving algorithms of seeded image segmentation and seed-based spectral segmentation. Compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms provide better segmentation results requiring less computing time.

Vehicle Image Generation Going Well with The Surroundings,"Since the generative neural networks have made a breakthrough in the image generation problem, lots of researches on their applications have been studied such as image restoration, style transfer and image completion. However, there has been few research generating objects in uncontrolled real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle image generation in real-world scenes. Using a subnetwork based on a precedent work of image completion, our model makes the shape of an object. Details of objects are trained by an additional colorization and refinement subnetwork, resulting in a better quality of generated objects. Unlike many other works, our method does not require any segmentation layout but still makes a plausible vehicle in the image. We evaluate our method by using images from Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) and Cityscape datasets, which are widely used for object detection and image segmentation problems. The adequacy of the generated images by the proposed method has also been evaluated using a widely utilized object detection algorithm and the FID score.",['cs.CV']
Segmentation of Roots in Soil with U-Net,"Plant root research can provide a way to attain stress-tolerant crops that produce greater yield in a diverse array of conditions. Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots. We evaluate our system using 867 images for which we have obtained line-intersect counts, attaining a Spearman rank correlation of 0.9748 and an $r^2$ of 0.9217. We also achieve an $F_1$ of 0.7 when comparing the automated segmentation to the manual annotations, with our automated segmentation system producing segmentations with higher quality than the manual annotations for large portions of the image.",['cs.CV']
Multi-label Cloud Segmentation Using a Deep Network,"Different empirical models have been developed for cloud detection. There is a growing interest in using the ground-based sky/cloud images for this purpose. Several methods exist that perform binary segmentation of clouds. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning architecture (U-Net) to perform multi-label sky/cloud image segmentation. The proposed approach outperforms recent literature by a large margin.",['cs.CV']
Learning-Based Cost Functions for 3D and 4D Multi-Surface Multi-Object Segmentation of Knee MRI: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative,"A fully automated knee MRI segmentation method to study osteoarthritis (OA) was developed using a novel hierarchical set of random forests (RF) classifiers to learn the appearance of cartilage regions and their boundaries. A neighborhood approximation forest is used first to provide contextual feature to the second-level RF classifier that also considers local features and produces location-specific costs for the layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and surfaces (LOGISMOS) framework. Double echo steady state (DESS) MRIs used in this work originated from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. Trained on 34 MRIs with varying degrees of OA, the performance of the learning-based method tested on 108 MRIs showed a significant reduction in segmentation errors (\emph{p}$<$0.05) compared with the conventional gradient-based and single-stage RF-learned costs. The 3D LOGISMOS was extended to longitudinal-3D (4D) to simultaneously segment multiple follow-up visits of the same patient. As such, data from all time-points of the temporal sequence contribute information to a single optimal solution that utilizes both spatial 3D and temporal contexts. 4D LOGISMOS validation on 108 MRIs from baseline and 12 month follow-up scans of 54 patients showed a significant reduction in segmentation errors (\emph{p}$<$0.01) compared to 3D. Finally, the potential of 4D LOGISMOS was further explored on the same 54 patients using 5 annual follow-up scans demonstrating a significant improvement of measuring cartilage thickness (\emph{p}$<$0.01) compared to the sequential 3D approach.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Multi-stream 3D FCN with Multi-scale Deep Supervision for Multi-modality Isointense Infant Brain MR Image Segmentation,"We present a method to address the challenging problem of segmentation of multi-modality isointense infant brain MR images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our method is based on context-guided, multi-stream fully convolutional networks (FCN), which after training, can directly map a whole volumetric data to its volume-wise labels. In order to alleviate the poten-tial gradient vanishing problem during training, we designed multi-scale deep supervision. Furthermore, context infor-mation was used to further improve the performance of our method. Validated on the test data of the MICCAI 2017 Grand Challenge on 6-month infant brain MRI segmentation (iSeg-2017), our method achieved an average Dice Overlap Coefficient of 95.4%, 91.6% and 89.6% for CSF, GM and WM, respectively.",['cs.CV']
The Method of Multimodal MRI Brain Image Segmentation Based on Differential Geometric Features,"Accurate segmentation of brain tissue in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a diffcult task due to different types of brain abnormalities. Using information and features from multimodal MRI including T1, T1-weighted inversion recovery (T1-IR) and T2-FLAIR and differential geometric features including the Jacobian determinant(JD) and the curl vector(CV) derived from T1 modality can result in a more accurate analysis of brain images. In this paper, we use the differential geometric information including JD and CV as image characteristics to measure the differences between different MRI images, which represent local size changes and local rotations of the brain image, and we can use them as one CNN channel with other three modalities (T1-weighted, T1-IR and T2-FLAIR) to get more accurate results of brain segmentation. We test this method on two datasets including IBSR dataset and MRBrainS datasets based on the deep voxelwise residual network, namely VoxResNet, and obtain excellent improvement over single modality or three modalities and increases average DSC(Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM)) by about 1.5% on the well-known MRBrainS18 dataset and about 2.5% on the IBSR dataset. Moreover, we discuss that one modality combined with its JD or CV information can replace the segmentation effect of three modalities, which can provide medical conveniences for doctor to diagnose because only to extract T1-modality MRI image of patients. Finally, we also compare the segmentation performance of our method in two networks, VoxResNet and U-Net network. The results show VoxResNet has a better performance than U-Net network with our method in brain MRI segmentation. We believe the proposed method can advance the performance in brain segmentation and clinical diagnosis.",['cs.CV']
SPDA: Superpixel-based Data Augmentation for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Supervised training a deep neural network aims to ""teach"" the network to mimic human visual perception that is represented by image-and-label pairs in the training data. Superpixelized (SP) images are visually perceivable to humans, but a conventionally trained deep learning model often performs poorly when working on SP images. To better mimic human visual perception, we think it is desirable for the deep learning model to be able to perceive not only raw images but also SP images. In this paper, we propose a new superpixel-based data augmentation (SPDA) method for training deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation. Our method applies a superpixel generation scheme to all the original training images to generate superpixelized images. The SP images thus obtained are then jointly used with the original training images to train a deep learning model. Our experiments of SPDA on four biomedical image datasets show that SPDA is effective and can consistently improve the performance of state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation in 2D and 3D images. Additional studies also demonstrate that SPDA can practically reduce the generalization gap.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Salient object detection on hyperspectral images using features learned from unsupervised segmentation task,"Various saliency detection algorithms from color images have been proposed to mimic eye fixation or attentive object detection response of human observers for the same scenes. However, developments on hyperspectral imaging systems enable us to obtain redundant spectral information of the observed scenes from the reflected light source from objects. A few studies using low-level features on hyperspectral images demonstrated that salient object detection can be achieved. In this work, we proposed a salient object detection model on hyperspectral images by applying manifold ranking (MR) on self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features (high-level features) from unsupervised image segmentation task. Self-supervision of CNN continues until clustering loss or saliency maps converges to a defined error between each iteration. Finally, saliency estimations is done as the saliency map at last iteration when the self-supervision procedure terminates with convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that proposed saliency detection algorithm on hyperspectral images is outperforming state-of-the-arts hyperspectral saliency models including the original MR based saliency model.",['cs.CV']
Towards increased trustworthiness of deep learning segmentation methods on cardiac MRI,"Current state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods have not yet made a broad entrance into the clinical setting in spite of high demand for such automatic methods. One important reason is the lack of reliability caused by models that fail unnoticed and often locally produce anatomically implausible results that medical experts would not make. This paper presents an automatic image segmentation method based on (Bayesian) dilated convolutional networks (DCNN) that generate segmentation masks and spatial uncertainty maps for the input image at hand. The method was trained and evaluated using segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) cavity, right ventricle (RV) endocardium and myocardium (Myo) at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) in 100 cardiac 2D MR scans from the MICCAI 2017 Challenge (ACDC). Combining segmentations and uncertainty maps and employing a human-in-the-loop setting, we provide evidence that image areas indicated as highly uncertain regarding the obtained segmentation almost entirely cover regions of incorrect segmentations. The fused information can be harnessed to increase segmentation performance. Our results reveal that we can obtain valuable spatial uncertainty maps with low computational effort using DCNNs.",['cs.CV']
Semi-Supervised Image-to-Image Translation,"Image-to-image translation is a long-established and a difficult problem in computer vision. In this paper we propose an adversarial based model for image-to-image translation. The regular deep neural-network based methods perform the task of image-to-image translation by comparing gram matrices and using image segmentation which requires human intervention. Our generative adversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach. This approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and content or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional reconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in conserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The advantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is semi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties of generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method has proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image translation.",['cs.CV']
Interactive Image Segmentation using Label Propagation through Complex Networks,"Interactive image segmentation is a topic of many studies in image processing. In a conventional approach, a user marks some pixels of the object(s) of interest and background, and an algorithm propagates these labels to the rest of the image. This paper presents a new graph-based method for interactive segmentation with two stages. In the first stage, nodes representing pixels are connected to their $k$-nearest neighbors to build a complex network with the small-world property to propagate the labels quickly. In the second stage, a regular network in a grid format is used to refine the segmentation on the object borders. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can perform the task with high accuracy. Computer simulations are performed using some real-world images to show its effectiveness in both two-classes and multi-classes problems. It is also applied to all the images from the Microsoft GrabCut dataset for comparison, and the segmentation accuracy is comparable to those achieved by some state-of-the-art methods, while it is faster than them. In particular, it outperforms some recent approaches when the user input is composed only by a few ""scribbles"" draw over the objects. Its computational complexity is only linear on the image size at the best-case scenario and linearithmic in the worst case.",['cs.CV']
Asymmetric Loss Functions and Deep Densely Connected Networks for Highly Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation: Application to Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Detection,"Fully convolutional deep neural networks have been asserted to be fast and precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major challenges in training such networks raises when data is unbalanced, which is common in many medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where lesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision and low recall, being severely biased towards the non-lesion class which is particularly undesired in most medical applications where FNs are more important than FPs. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem, more recently similarity loss functions and focal loss. In this work we trained fully convolutional deep neural networks using an asymmetric similarity loss function to mitigate the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better tradeoff between precision and recall. To this end, we developed a 3D FC-DenseNet with large overlapping image patches as input and an asymmetric similarity loss layer based on Tversky index (using Fbeta scores). We used large overlapping image patches as inputs for intrinsic and extrinsic data augmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion strategy using B-spline weighted soft voting to account for the uncertainty of prediction in patch borders. We applied this method to MS lesion segmentation based on two different datasets of MSSEG and ISBI longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge, where we achieved top performance in both challenges. Our network trained with focal loss ranked first according to the ISBI challenge overall score and resulted in the lowest reported lesion false positive rate among all submitted methods. Our network trained with the asymmetric similarity loss led to the lowest surface distance and the best lesion true positive rate.",['cs.CV']
NFFT meets Krylov methods: Fast matrix-vector products for the graph Laplacian of fully connected networks,"The graph Laplacian is a standard tool in data science, machine learning, and image processing. The corresponding matrix inherits the complex structure of the underlying network and is in certain applications densely populated. This makes computations, in particular matrix-vector products, with the graph Laplacian a hard task. A typical application is the computation of a number of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Standard methods become infeasible as the number of nodes in the graph is too large. We propose the use of the fast summation based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) to perform the dense matrix-vector product with the graph Laplacian fast without ever forming the whole matrix. The enormous flexibility of the NFFT algorithm allows us to embed the accelerated multiplication into Lanczos-based eigenvalues routines or iterative linear system solvers and even consider other than the standard Gaussian kernels. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach on a number of test problems from image segmentation to semi-supervised learning based on graph-based PDEs. In particular, we compare our approach with the Nystr\""om method. Moreover, we present and test an enhanced, hybrid version of the Nystr\""om method, which internally uses the NFFT.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Brain Tumor Segmentation using an Ensemble of 3D U-Nets and Overall Survival Prediction using Radiomic Features,"Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas including peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape, segmentation of the sub-regions is very challenging. Recent development using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in the past several brain segmentation challenges as well as other semantic and medical image segmentation problems. Most models in brain tumor segmentation use a 2D/3D patch to predict the class label for the center voxel and variant patch sizes and scales are used to improve the model performance. However, it has low computation efficiency and also has limited receptive field. U-Net is a widely used network structure for end-to-end segmentation and can be used on the entire image or extracted patches to provide classification labels over the entire input voxels so that it is more efficient and expect to yield better performance with larger input size. Furthermore, instead of picking the best network structure, an ensemble of multiple models, trained on different dataset or different hyper-parameters, can generally improve the segmentation performance. In this study we propose to use an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with different hyper-parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Preliminary results showed effectiveness of this model. In addition, we developed a linear model for survival prediction using extracted imaging and non-imaging features, which, despite the simplicity, can effectively reduce overfitting and regression errors.",['cs.CV']
SUSAN: Segment Unannotated image Structure using Adversarial Network,"Segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a fundamental step in many medical imaging-based applications. The recent implementation of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have significant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of segmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data representing pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the supervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more network parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue masks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based segmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated segmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated training data. A technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is applied as the core of the proposed method to perform image-to-image translation between MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. A joint segmentation network is incorporated into the adversarial network to obtain additional segmentation functionality. The proposed method was evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image datasets acquired at our institution using only a single set of annotated data from a publicly available knee MR image dataset. The new technique may further improve the applicability and efficiency of CNN-based segmentation of medical images while eliminating the need for large amounts of annotated training data.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
On the Computational Inefficiency of Large Batch Sizes for Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Increasing the mini-batch size for stochastic gradient descent offers significant opportunities to reduce wall-clock training time, but there are a variety of theoretical and systems challenges that impede the widespread success of this technique. We investigate these issues, with an emphasis on time to convergence and total computational cost, through an extensive empirical analysis of network training across several architectures and problem domains, including image classification, image segmentation, and language modeling. Although it is common practice to increase the batch size in order to fully exploit available computational resources, we find a substantially more nuanced picture. Our main finding is that across a wide range of network architectures and problem domains, increasing the batch size beyond a certain point yields no decrease in wall-clock time to convergence for \emph{either} train or test loss. This batch size is usually substantially below the capacity of current systems. We show that popular training strategies for large batch size optimization begin to fail before we can populate all available compute resources, and we show that the point at which these methods break down depends more on attributes like model architecture and data complexity than it does directly on the size of the dataset.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Validating Hyperspectral Image Segmentation,"Hyperspectral satellite imaging attracts enormous research attention in the remote sensing community, hence automated approaches for precise segmentation of such imagery are being rapidly developed. In this letter, we share our observations on the strategy for validating hyperspectral image segmentation algorithms currently followed in the literature, and show that it can lead to over-optimistic experimental insights. We introduce a new routine for generating segmentation benchmarks, and use it to elaborate ready-to-use hyperspectral training-test data partitions. They can be utilized for fair validation of new and existing algorithms without any training-test data leakage.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"

Prostate Segmentation using 2D Bridged U-net,"In this paper, we focus on three problems in deep learning based medical image segmentation. Firstly, U-net, as a popular model for medical image segmentation, is difficult to train when convolutional layers increase even though a deeper network usually has a better generalization ability because of more learnable parameters. Secondly, the exponential ReLU (ELU), as an alternative of ReLU, is not much different from ReLU when the network of interest gets deep. Thirdly, the Dice loss, as one of the pervasive loss functions for medical image segmentation, is not effective when the prediction is close to ground truth and will cause oscillation during training. To address the aforementioned three problems, we propose and validate a deeper network that can fit medical image datasets that are usually small in the sample size. Meanwhile, we propose a new loss function to accelerate the learning process and a combination of different activation functions to improve the network performance. Our experimental results suggest that our network is comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Deep Learning for End-to-End Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence Estimation,"Left atrium shape has been shown to be an independent predictor of recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Shape-based representation is imperative to such an estimation process, where correspondence-based representation offers the most flexibility and ease-of-computation for population-level shape statistics. Nonetheless, population-level shape representations in the form of image segmentation and correspondence models derived from cardiac MRI require significant human resources with sufficient anatomy-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that uses deep networks to estimate AF recurrence by predicting shape descriptors directly from MRI images, with NO image pre-processing involved. We also propose a novel data augmentation scheme to effectively train a deep network in a limited training data setting. We compare this new method of estimating shape descriptors from images with the state-of-the-art correspondence-based shape modeling that requires image segmentation and correspondence optimization. Results show that the proposed method and the current state-of-the-art produce statistically similar outcomes on AF recurrence, eliminating the need for expensive pre-processing pipelines and associated human labor.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
Multi-Level Contextual Network for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Accurate and reliable image segmentation is an essential part of biomedical image analysis. In this paper, we consider the problem of biomedical image segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks.

Specifically, we introduce a deep fully convolution residual network with a new skip connection strategy to control the contextual information passed forward. Moreover, our trained model is also computationally inexpensive due to its small number of network parameters. We evaluate our method on two public datasets for epithelium segmentation and tubule segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that the proposed method provides a fast and effective way of producing a pixel-wise dense prediction of biomedical images.",['cs.CV']
Interactive Binary Image Segmentation with Edge Preservation,"Binary image segmentation plays an important role in computer vision and has been widely used in many applications such as image and video editing, object extraction, and photo composition. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive binary image segmentation method based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework and the fast bilateral solver (FBS) technique. Specifically, we employ the geodesic distance component to build the unary term. To ensure both computation efficiency and effective responsiveness for interactive segmentation, superpixels are used in computing geodesic distances instead of pixels. Furthermore, we take a bilateral affinity approach for the pairwise term in order to preserve edge information and denoise. Through the alternating direction strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into two subproblems, which then can be easily solved by steepest gradient descent (SGD) and FBS respectively. Experimental results on the VGG interactive image segmentation dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art ones, and in particular, it can achieve satisfactory edge-smooth segmentation results even when the foreground and background color appearances are quite indistinctive.",['cs.CV']
YouTube-VOS: A Large-Scale Video Object Segmentation Benchmark,"Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 4,453 YouTube video clips and 94 object categories. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and has been released at http://youtube-vos.org. We further evaluate several existing state-of-the-art video object segmentation algorithms on this dataset which aims to establish baselines for the development of new algorithms in the future.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Iris recognition in cases of eye pathology,"This chapter provides insight on how iris recognition, one of the leading biometric identification technologies in the world, can be impacted by pathologies and illnesses present in the eye, what are the possible repercussions of this influence, and what are the possible means for taking such effects into account when matching iris samples.   To make this study possible, a special database of iris images has been used, representing more than 20 different medical conditions of the ocular region (including cataract, glaucoma, rubeosis iridis, synechiae, iris defects, corneal pathologies and other) and containing almost 3000 samples collected from 230 distinct irises. Then, with the use of four different iris recognition methods, a series of experiments has been conducted, concluding in several important observations.   One of the most popular ocular disorders worldwide - the cataract - is shown to worsen genuine comparison scores when results obtained from cataract-affected eyes are compared to those coming from healthy irises. An analysis devoted to different types of impact on eye structures caused by diseases is also carried out with significant results. The enrollment process is highly sensitive to those eye conditions that make the iris obstructed or introduce geometrical distortions. Disorders affecting iris geometry, or producing obstructions are exceptionally capable of degrading the genuine comparison scores, so that the performance of the entire biometric system can be influenced. Experiments also reveal that imperfect execution of the image segmentation stage is the most prominent contributor to recognition errors.",['cs.CV']
Iris Recognition with a Database of Iris Images Obtained in Visible Light Using Smartphone Camera,"This paper delivers a new database of iris images collected in visible light using a mobile phone's camera and presents results of experiments involving existing commercial and open-source iris recognition methods, namely: IriCore, VeriEye, MIRLIN and OSIRIS. Several important observations are made.   First, we manage to show that after simple preprocessing, such images offer good visibility of iris texture even in heavily-pigmented irides. Second, for all four methods, the enrollment stage is not much affected by the fact that different type of data is used as input. This translates to zero or close-to-zero Failure To Enroll, i.e., cases when templates could not be extracted from the samples. Third, we achieved good matching accuracy, with correct genuine match rate exceeding 94.5% for all four methods, while simultaneously being able to maintain zero false match rate in every case. Correct genuine match rate of over 99.5% was achieved using one of the commercial methods, showing that such images can be used with the existing biometric solutions with minimum additional effort required. Finally, the experiments revealed that incorrect image segmentation is the most prevalent cause of recognition accuracy decrease.   To our best knowledge, this is the first database of iris images captured using a mobile device, in which image quality exceeds this of a near-infrared illuminated iris images, as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-6 and 29794-6 documents. This database will be publicly available to all researchers.",['cs.CV']
Cataract influence on iris recognition performance,"This paper presents the experimental study revealing weaker performance of the automatic iris recognition methods for cataract-affected eyes when compared to healthy eyes. There is little research on the topic, mostly incorporating scarce databases that are often deficient in images representing more than one illness. We built our own database, acquiring 1288 eye images of 37 patients of the Medical University of Warsaw. Those images represent several common ocular diseases, such as cataract, along with less ordinary conditions, such as iris pattern alterations derived from illness or eye trauma. Images were captured in near-infrared light (used in biometrics) and for selected cases also in visible light (used in ophthalmological diagnosis). Since cataract is a disorder that is most populated by samples in the database, in this paper we focus solely on this illness. To assess the extent of the performance deterioration we use three iris recognition methodologies (commercial and academic solutions) to calculate genuine match scores for healthy eyes and those influenced by cataract. Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers used in this study (12% of genuine score increase for an academic matcher, up to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example commercial matcher). This increase in genuine scores affected the final false non-match rate in two matchers. To our best knowledge this is the only study of such kind that employs more than one iris matcher, and analyzes the iris image segmentation as a potential source of decreased reliability.",['cs.CV']
Understanding Neural Pathways in Zebrafish through Deep Learning and High Resolution Electron Microscope Data,"The tracing of neural pathways through large volumes of image data is an incredibly tedious and time-consuming process that significantly encumbers progress in neuroscience. We are exploring deep learning's potential to automate segmentation of high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) image data to remove that barrier. We have started with neural pathway tracing through 5.1GB of whole-brain serial-section slices from larval zebrafish collected by the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University. This kind of manual image segmentation requires years of careful work to properly trace the neural pathways in an organism as small as a zebrafish larva (approximately 5mm in total body length). In automating this process, we would vastly improve productivity, leading to faster data analysis and breakthroughs in understanding the complexity of the brain. We will build upon prior attempts to employ deep learning for automatic image segmentation extending methods for unconventional deep learning data.",['cs.CV']
TreeSegNet: Adaptive Tree CNNs for Subdecimeter Aerial Image Segmentation,"For the task of subdecimeter aerial imagery segmentation, fine-grained semantic segmentation results are usually difficult to obtain because of complex remote sensing content and optical conditions. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance on this task. Although many deep neural network structures and techniques have been applied to improve the accuracy, few have paid attention to better differentiating the easily confused classes. In this paper, we propose TreeSegNet which adopts an adaptive network to increase the classification rate at the pixelwise level. Specifically, based on the infrastructure of DeepUNet, a Tree-CNN block in which each node represents a ResNeXt unit is constructed adaptively according to the confusion matrix and the proposed TreeCutting algorithm. By transporting feature maps through concatenating connections, the Tree-CNN block fuses multiscale features and learns best weights for the model. In experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset, the results obtained by TreeSegNet are better than those of other published state-of-the-art methods. Detailed comparison and analysis show that the improvement brought by the adaptive Tree-CNN block is significant.",['cs.CV']
Weakly-Supervised Learning-Based Feature Localization in Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Glioma Images,"Confocal Laser Endomicroscope (CLE) is a novel handheld fluorescence imaging device that has shown promise for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumor tissue. Currently CLE is capable of image display only and lacks an automatic system to aid the surgeon in analyzing the images. The goal of this project was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma with feature localization function. Despite the tremendous progress in object detection and image segmentation methods in recent years, most of such methods require large annotated datasets for training. However, manual annotation of thousands of histopathological images by physicians is costly and time consuming. To overcome this problem, we propose a Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, and then localizes incidences of a class-of-interest in the test image. We developed a novel convolutional neural network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To validate our method, we compared proposed model's output to the manual annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images. Proposed model achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate features and 87% mean accuracy and 88% mean intersection over union on restrictive fine features, while outperforming other state of the art methods tested. This system can improve accuracy and efficiency in characterization of CLE images of glioma tissue during surgery, augment intraoperative decision-making process regarding tumor margin and affect resection rates.",['cs.CV']
A multi-contrast MRI approach to thalamus segmentation,"Thalamic alterations are relevant to many neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Routine interventions to improve symptom severity in movement disorders, for example, often consist of surgery or deep brain stimulation to diencephalic nuclei. Therefore, accurate delineation of grey matter thalamic subregions is of the upmost clinical importance. MRI is highly appropriate for structural segmentation as it provides different views of the anatomy from a single scanning session. Though with several contrasts potentially available, it is also of increasing importance to develop new image segmentation techniques that can operate multi-spectrally. We hereby propose a new segmentation method for use with multi-modality data, which we evaluated for automated segmentation of major thalamic subnuclear groups using T1-, T2*-weighted and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) information. The proposed method consists of four steps: highly iterative image co-registration, manual segmentation on the average training-data template, supervised learning for pattern recognition, and a final convex optimisation step imposing further spatial constraints to refine the solution. This led to solutions in greater agreement with manual segmentation than the standard Morel atlas based approach. Furthermore, we show that the multi-contrast approach boosts segmentation performances. We then investigated whether prior knowledge using the training-template contours could further improve convex segmentation accuracy and robustness, which led to highly precise multi-contrast segmentations in single subjects. This approach can be extended to most 3D imaging data types and any region of interest discernible in single scans or multi-subject templates.",['cs.CV']
Automatically Designing CNN Architectures for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep neural network architectures have traditionally been designed and explored with human expertise in a long-lasting trial-and-error process. This process requires huge amount of time, expertise, and resources. To address this tedious problem, we propose a novel algorithm to optimally find hyperparameters of a deep network architecture automatically. We specifically focus on designing neural architectures for medical image segmentation task. Our proposed method is based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning for which the reward function is assigned a segmentation evaluation utility (i.e., dice index). We show the efficacy of the proposed method with its low computational cost in comparison with the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation networks. We also present a new architecture design, a densely connected encoder-decoder CNN, as a strong baseline architecture to apply the proposed hyperparameter search algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithm to each layer of the baseline architectures. As an application, we train the proposed system on cine cardiac MR images from Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) MICCAI 2017. Starting from a baseline segmentation architecture, the resulting network architecture obtains the state-of-the-art results in accuracy without performing any trial-and-error based architecture design approaches or close supervision of the hyperparameters changes.","['stat.ML', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Sem-GAN: Semantically-Consistent Image-to-Image Translation,"Unpaired image-to-image translation is the problem of mapping an image in the source domain to one in the target domain, without requiring corresponding image pairs. To ensure the translated images are realistically plausible, recent works, such as Cycle-GAN, demands this mapping to be invertible. While, this requirement demonstrates promising results when the domains are unimodal, its performance is unpredictable in a multi-modal scenario such as in an image segmentation task. This is because, invertibility does not necessarily enforce semantic correctness. To this end, we present a semantically-consistent GAN framework, dubbed Sem-GAN, in which the semantics are defined by the class identities of image segments in the source domain as produced by a semantic segmentation algorithm. Our proposed framework includes consistency constraints on the translation task that, together with the GAN loss and the cycle-constraints, enforces that the images when translated will inherit the appearances of the target domain, while (approximately) maintaining their identities from the source domain. We present experiments on several image-to-image translation tasks and demonstrate that Sem-GAN improves the quality of the translated images significantly, sometimes by more than 20% on the FCN score. Further, we show that semantic segmentation models, trained with synthetic images translated via Sem-GAN, leads to significantly better segmentation results than other variants.",['cs.CV']
"Efficient identification, localization and quantification of grapevine inflorescences in unprepared field images using Fully Convolutional Networks","Yield and its prediction is one of the most important tasks in grapevine breeding purposes and vineyard management. Commonly, this trait is estimated manually right before harvest by extrapolation, which mostly is labor-intensive, destructive and inaccurate. In the present study an automated image-based workflow was developed quantifying inflorescences and single flowers in unprepared field images of grapevines, i.e. no artificial background or light was applied. It is a novel approach for non-invasive, inexpensive and objective phenotyping with high-throughput.   First, image regions depicting inflorescences were identified and localized. This was done by segmenting the images into the classes ""inflorescence"" and ""non-inflorescence"" using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Efficient image segmentation hereby is the most challenging step regarding the small geometry and dense distribution of flowers (several hundred flowers per inflorescence), similar color of all plant organs in the fore- and background as well as the circumstance that only approximately 5% of an image show inflorescences. The trained FCN achieved a mean Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 87.6% on the test data set. Finally, individual flowers were extracted from the ""inflorescence""-areas using Circular Hough Transform. The flower extraction achieved a recall of 80.3% and a precision of 70.7% using the segmentation derived by the trained FCN model.   Summarized, the presented approach is a promising strategy in order to predict yield potential automatically in the earliest stage of grapevine development which is applicable for objective monitoring and evaluations of breeding material, genetic repositories or commercial vineyards.",['cs.CV']
H-DenseUNet: Hybrid Densely Connected UNet for Liver and Tumor Segmentation from CT Volumes,"Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), including 2D and 3D FCNs, serve as the back-bone in many volumetric image segmentation. However, 2D convolutions can not fully leverage the spatial information along the third dimension while 3D convolutions suffer from high computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of a 2D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3D counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We formulate the learning process of H-DenseUNet in an end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion (HFF) layer. We extensively evaluated our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and 3DIRCADb Dataset. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance for liver segmentation even with a single model.",['cs.CV']
Function Norms and Regularization in Deep Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their excellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However, regularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the complex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring function complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive regularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based approximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural networks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the literature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating the necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound for functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic optimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the improved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex function sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image segmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay, dropout, and batch normalization. Source code will be released at the time of publication.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
CompNet: Complementary Segmentation Network for Brain MRI Extraction,"Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose complementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain from T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The proposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and have two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its complementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway extracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to brain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on the OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the two-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is verified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its invariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network design is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation problems with better generalization.",['cs.CV']
Language-Based Image Editing with Recurrent Attentive Models,"We investigate the problem of Language-Based Image Editing (LBIE). Given a source image and a natural language description, we want to generate a target image by editing the source image based on the description. We propose a generic modeling framework for two sub-tasks of LBIE: language-based image segmentation and image colorization. The framework uses recurrent attentive models to fuse image and language features. Instead of using a fixed step size, we introduce for each region of the image a termination gate to dynamically determine after each inference step whether to continue extrapolating additional information from the textual description. The effectiveness of the framework is validated on three datasets. First, we introduce a synthetic dataset, called CoSaL, to evaluate the end-to-end performance of our LBIE system. Second, we show that the framework leads to state-of-the-art performance on image segmentation on the ReferIt dataset. Third, we present the first language-based colorization result on the Oxford-102 Flowers dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"
Contextual Hourglass Networks for Segmentation and Density Estimation,"Hourglass networks such as the U-Net and V-Net are popular neural architectures for medical image segmentation and counting problems. Typical instances of hourglass networks contain shortcut connections between mirroring layers. These shortcut connections improve the performance and it is hypothesized that this is due to mitigating effects on the vanishing gradient problem and the ability of the model to combine feature maps from earlier and later layers. We propose a method for not only combining feature maps of mirroring layers but also feature maps of layers with different spatial dimensions. For instance, the method enables the integration of the bottleneck feature map with those of the reconstruction layers. The proposed approach is applicable to any hourglass architecture. We evaluated the contextual hourglass networks on image segmentation and object counting problems in the medical domain. We achieve competitive results outperforming popular hourglass networks by up to 17 percentage points.",['cs.CV']
Efficient semantic image segmentation with superpixel pooling,"In this work, we evaluate the use of superpixel pooling layers in deep network architectures for semantic segmentation. Superpixel pooling is a flexible and efficient replacement for other pooling strategies that incorporates spatial prior information. We propose a simple and efficient GPU-implementation of the layer and explore several designs for the integration of the layer into existing network architectures. We provide experimental results on the IBSR and Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating that superpixel pooling can be leveraged to consistently increase network accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

"Learn the new, keep the old: Extending pretrained models with new anatomy and images","Deep learning has been widely accepted as a promising solution for medical image segmentation, given a sufficiently large representative dataset of images with corresponding annotations. With ever increasing amounts of annotated medical datasets, it is infeasible to train a learning method always with all data from scratch. This is also doomed to hit computational limits, e.g., memory or runtime feasible for training. Incremental learning can be a potential solution, where new information (images or anatomy) is introduced iteratively. Nevertheless, for the preservation of the collective information, it is essential to keep some ""important"" (i.e. representative) images and annotations from the past, while adding new information. In this paper, we introduce a framework for applying incremental learning for segmentation and propose novel methods for selecting representative data therein. We comparatively evaluate our methods in different scenarios using MR images and validate the increased learning capacity with using our methods.","['cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network based on U-Net (R2U-Net) for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning (DL) based semantic segmentation methods have been providing state-of-the-art performance in the last few years. More specifically, these techniques have been successfully applied to medical image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. One deep learning technique, U-Net, has become one of the most popular for these applications. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based on U-Net as well as a Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RRCNN) based on U-Net models, which are named RU-Net and R2U-Net respectively. The proposed models utilize the power of U-Net, Residual Network, as well as RCNN. There are several advantages of these proposed architectures for segmentation tasks. First, a residual unit helps when training deep architecture. Second, feature accumulation with recurrent residual convolutional layers ensures better feature representation for segmentation tasks. Third, it allows us to design better U-Net architecture with same number of network parameters with better performance for medical image segmentation. The proposed models are tested on three benchmark datasets such as blood vessel segmentation in retina images, skin cancer segmentation, and lung lesion segmentation. The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to equivalent models including U-Net and residual U-Net (ResU-Net).",['cs.CV']
Convolutional CRFs for Semantic Segmentation,"For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the most efficient models have traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available.

Discrete-Continuous ADMM for Transductive Inference in Higher-Order MRFs,"This paper introduces a novel algorithm for transductive inference in higher-order MRFs, where the unary energies are parameterized by a variable classifier. The considered task is posed as a joint optimization problem in the continuous classifier parameters and the discrete label variables. In contrast to prior approaches such as convex relaxations, we propose an advantageous decoupling of the objective function into discrete and continuous subproblems and a novel, efficient optimization method related to ADMM. This approach preserves integrality of the discrete label variables and guarantees global convergence to a critical point. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in several experiments including video object segmentation on the DAVIS data set and interactive image segmentation.",['cs.LG']
Segmentation of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images Using Variational Methods and Empirical Wavelets,"In the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is important to be able to functionalize surfaces chemically for a wide variety of applications. Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area used to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular resolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine the surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images reveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since they convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material.   In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we propose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image segmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and the other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a cartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and texture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified multiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is segmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering algorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features, specifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition and of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized framework to segment STM images and other data. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we apply it to actual STM images of cyanide monolayers on Au\{111\} and present their corresponding segmentation results.",['cs.CV']
Outline Objects using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Image segmentation needs both local boundary position information and global object context information. The performance of the recent state-of-the-art method, fully convolutional networks, reaches a bottleneck due to the neural network limit after balancing between the two types of information simultaneously in an end-to-end training style. To overcome this problem, we divide the semantic image segmentation into temporal subtasks. First, we find a possible pixel position of some object boundary; then trace the boundary at steps within a limited length until the whole object is outlined. We present the first deep reinforcement learning approach to semantic image segmentation, called DeepOutline, which outperforms other algorithms in Coco detection leaderboard in the middle and large size person category in Coco val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, it provides an insight into a divide and conquer way by reinforcement learning on computer vision problems.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Derivate-based Component-Trees for Multi-Channel Image Segmentation,"We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an arbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the classical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure enables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on the component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example application, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally Stable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be applied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our approach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than their background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications where MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the derivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of pixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an increasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",['cs.CV']
A Multi-Layer Approach to Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional Random Field for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional random fields (SP-HO-CRFs) are known for their effectiveness in enforcing both short and long spatial contiguity for pixelwise labelling in computer vision. However, their higher-order potentials are usually too complex to learn and often incur a high computational cost in performing inference. We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of object categories such as ""trees"" and ""bushes"". Multiple sets of experiments conducted on dataset MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.",['cs.CV']
"Ω-Net (Omega-Net): Fully Automatic, Multi-View Cardiac MR Detection, Orientation, and Segmentation with Deep Neural Networks","Pixelwise segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium and the four cardiac chambers in 2-D steady state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences is an essential preprocessing step for a wide range of analyses. Variability in contrast, appearance, orientation, and placement of the heart between patients, clinical views, scanners, and protocols makes fully automatic semantic segmentation a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we present ${\Omega}$-Net (Omega-Net): a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for simultaneous localization, transformation into a canonical orientation, and semantic segmentation. First, an initial segmentation is performed on the input image, second, the features learned during this initial segmentation are used to predict the parameters needed to transform the input image into a canonical orientation, and third, a final segmentation is performed on the transformed image. In this work, ${\Omega}$-Nets of varying depths were trained to detect five foreground classes in any of three clinical views (short axis, SA, four-chamber, 4C, two-chamber, 2C), without prior knowledge of the view being segmented. The architecture was trained on a cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and healthy control subjects. Network performance as measured by weighted foreground intersection-over-union (IoU) was substantially improved in the best-performing ${\Omega}$- Net compared with U-Net segmentation without localization or orientation. In addition, {\Omega}-Net was retrained from scratch on the 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the LV and RV bloodpools, and performed slightly worse in segmentation of the LV myocardium. We conclude this architecture represents a substantive advancement over prior approaches, with implications for biomedical image segmentation more generally.",['cs.CV']
Combining Multi-level Contexts of Superpixel using Convolutional Neural Networks to perform Natural Scene Labeling,"Modern deep learning algorithms have triggered various image segmentation approaches. However most of them deal with pixel based segmentation. However, superpixels provide a certain degree of contextual information while reducing computation cost. In our approach, we have performed superpixel level semantic segmentation considering 3 various levels as neighbours for semantic contexts. Furthermore, we have enlisted a number of ensemble approaches like max-voting and weighted-average. We have also used the Dempster-Shafer theory of uncertainty to analyze confusion among various classes. Our method has proved to be superior to a number of different modern approaches on the same dataset.",['cs.CV']
Simultaneous Traffic Sign Detection and Boundary Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network,"We propose a novel traffic sign detection system that simultaneously estimates the location and precise boundary of traffic signs using convolutional neural network (CNN). Estimating the precise boundary of traffic signs is important in navigation systems for intelligent vehicles where traffic signs can be used as 3D landmarks for road environment. Previous traffic sign detection systems, including recent methods based on CNN, only provide bounding boxes of traffic signs as output, and thus requires additional processes such as contour estimation or image segmentation to obtain the precise sign boundary. In this work, the boundary estimation of traffic signs is formulated as a 2D pose and shape class prediction problem, and this is effectively solved by a single CNN. With the predicted 2D pose and the shape class of a target traffic sign in an input image, we estimate the actual boundary of the target sign by projecting the boundary of a corresponding template sign image into the input image plane. By formulating the boundary estimation problem as a CNN-based pose and shape prediction task, our method is end-to-end trainable, and more robust to occlusion and small targets than other boundary estimation methods that rely on contour estimation or image segmentation. The proposed method with architectural optimization provides an accurate traffic sign boundary estimation which is also efficient in compute, showing a detection frame rate higher than 7 frames per second on low-power mobile platforms.",['cs.CV']
Self-Learning to Detect and Segment Cysts in Lung CT Images without Manual Annotation,"Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks achieve impressive performances on many medical image segmentation tasks by supervised learning on large manually annotated data. However, expert annotations on big medical datasets are tedious, expensive or sometimes unavailable. Weakly supervised learning could reduce the effort for annotation but still required certain amounts of expertise. Recently, deep learning shows a potential to produce more accurate predictions than the original erroneous labels. Inspired by this, we introduce a very weakly supervised learning method, for cystic lesion detection and segmentation in lung CT images, without any manual annotation. Our method works in a self-learning manner, where segmentation generated in previous steps (first by unsupervised segmentation then by neural networks) is used as ground truth for the next level of network learning. Experiments on a cystic lung lesion dataset show that the deep learning could perform better than the initial unsupervised annotation, and progressively improve itself after self-learning.",['cs.CV']
Fully Convolutional Multi-scale Residual DenseNets for Cardiac Segmentation and Automated Cardiac Diagnosis using Ensemble of Classifiers,"Deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based architectures have shown great potential in medical image segmentation. However, such architectures usually have millions of parameters and inadequate number of training samples leading to over-fitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we present a novel highly parameter and memory efficient FCN based architecture for medical image analysis. We propose a novel up-sampling path which incorporates long skip and short-cut connections to overcome the feature map explosion in FCN like architectures. In order to processes the input images at multiple scales and view points simultaneously, we propose to incorporate Inception module's parallel structures. We also propose a novel dual loss function whose weighting scheme allows to combine advantages of cross-entropy and dice loss. We have validated our proposed network architecture on two publicly available datasets, namely: (i) Automated Cardiac Disease Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC-2017), (ii) Left Ventricular Segmentation Challenge (LV-2011). Our approach in ACDC-2017 challenge stands second place for segmentation and first place in automated cardiac disease diagnosis tasks with an accuracy of 100%. In the LV-2011 challenge our approach attained 0.74 Jaccard index, which is so far the highest published result in fully automated algorithms. From the segmentation we extracted clinically relevant cardiac parameters and hand-crafted features which reflected the clinical diagnostic analysis to train an ensemble system for cardiac disease classification. Our approach combined both cardiac segmentation and disease diagnosis into a fully automated framework which is computational efficient and hence has the potential to be incorporated in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for clinical application.",['cs.CV']
A First Derivative Potts Model for Segmentation and Denoising Using ILP,"Unsupervised image segmentation and denoising are two fundamental tasks in image processing. Usually, graph based models such as multicut are used for segmentation and variational models are employed for denoising. Our approach addresses both problems at the same time. We propose a novel ILP formulation of the first derivative Potts model with the $\ell_1$ data term, where binary variables are introduced to deal with the $\ell_0$ norm of the regularization term. The ILP is then solved by a standard off-the-shelf MIP solver. Numerical experiments are compared with the multicut problem.",['cs.CV']
Automated image segmentation for detecting cell spreading for metastasizing assessments of cancer development,"The automated segmentation of cells in microscopic images is an open research problem that has important implications for studies of the developmental and cancer processes based on in vitro models.

Camera-trap images segmentation using multi-layer robust principal component analysis,"The segmentation of animals from camera-trap images is a difficult task. To illustrate, there are various challenges due to environmental conditions and hardware limitation in these images. We proposed a multi-layer robust principal component analysis (multi-layer RPCA) approach for background subtraction. Our method computes sparse and low-rank images from a weighted sum of descriptors, using color and texture features as case of study for camera-trap images segmentation. The segmentation algorithm is composed of histogram equalization or Gaussian filtering as pre-processing, and morphological filters with active contour as post-processing. The parameters of our multi-layer RPCA were optimized with an exhaustive search. The database consists of camera-trap images from the Colombian forest taken by the Instituto de Investigaci\'on de Recursos Biol\'ogicos Alexander von Humboldt. We analyzed the performance of our method in inherent and therefore challenging situations of camera-trap images. Furthermore, we compared our method with some state-of-the-art algorithms of background subtraction, where our multi-layer RPCA outperformed these other methods. Our multi-layer RPCA reached 76.17 and 69.97% of average fine-grained F-measure for color and infrared sequences, respectively. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work proposing multi-layer RPCA and using it for camera-trap images segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Conditional Random Field and Deep Feature Learning for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation is considered to be one of the critical tasks in hyperspectral remote sensing image processing. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has established itself as a powerful model in segmentation and classification by demonstrating excellent performances. The use of a graphical model such as a conditional random field (CRF) contributes further in capturing contextual information and thus improving the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a method to segment hyperspectral images by considering both spectral and spatial information via a combined framework consisting of CNN and CRF. We use multiple spectral cubes to learn deep features using CNN, and then formulate deep CRF with CNN-based unary and pairwise potential functions to effectively extract the semantic correlations between patches consisting of three-dimensional data cubes. Effective piecewise training is applied in order to avoid the computationally expensive iterative CRF inference. Furthermore, we introduce a deep deconvolution network that improves the segmentation masks. We also introduce a new dataset and experimented our proposed method on it along with several widely adopted benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. By comparing our results with those from several state-of-the-art models, we show the promising potential of our method.",['cs.CV']
Classification With an Edge: Improving Semantic Image Segmentation with Boundary Detection,"We present an end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation with built-in awareness of semantically meaningful boundaries. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental remote sensing task, and most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here, we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model by adding boundary detection to the Segnet encoder-decoder architecture. Second, we also include boundary detection in FCN-type models and set up a high-end classifier ensemble. We show that boundary detection significantly improves semantic segmentation with CNNs. Our high-end ensemble achieves > 90% overall accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark.",['cs.CV']
Partial Labeled Gastric Tumor Segmentation via patch-based Reiterative Learning,"Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the major hurdle in biomedical image analysis is the determination of the cancer extent. This assignment has high clinical relevance and would generally require vast microscopic assessment by pathologists. Recent advances in deep learning have produced inspiring results on biomedical image segmentation, while its outcome is reliant on comprehensive annotation. This requires plenty of labor costs, for the ground truth must be annotated meticulously by pathologists. In this paper, a reiterative learning framework was presented to train our network on partial annotated biomedical images, and superior performance was achieved without any pre-trained or further manual annotation. We eliminate the boundary error of patch-based model through our overlapped region forecast algorithm. Through these advisable methods, a mean intersection over union coefficient (IOU) of 0.883 and mean accuracy of 91.09% on the partial labeled dataset was achieved, which made us win the 2017 China Big Data & Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competitions.",['cs.CV']
Deep CNN ensembles and suggestive annotations for infant brain MRI segmentation,"Precise 3D segmentation of infant brain tissues is an essential step towards comprehensive volumetric studies and quantitative analysis of early brain developement. However, computing such segmentations is very challenging, especially for 6-month infant brain, due to the poor image quality, among other difficulties inherent to infant brain MRI, e.g., the isointense contrast between white and gray matter and the severe partial volume effect due to small brain sizes. This study investigates the problem with an ensemble of semi-dense fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which employs T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images as input. We demonstrate that the ensemble agreement is highly correlated with the segmentation errors. Therefore, our method provides measures that can guide local user corrections. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first ensemble of 3D CNNs for suggesting annotations within images. Furthermore, inspired by the very recent success of dense networks, we propose a novel architecture, SemiDenseNet, which connects all convolutional layers directly to the end of the network. Our architecture allows the efficient propagation of gradients during training, while limiting the number of parameters, requiring one order of magnitude less parameters than popular medical image segmentation networks such as 3D U-Net. Another contribution of our work is the study of the impact that early or late fusions of multiple image modalities might have on the performances of deep architectures. We report evaluations of our method on the public data of the MICCAI iSEG-2017 Challenge on 6-month infant brain MRI segmentation, and show very competitive results among 21 teams, ranking first or second in most metrics.",['cs.CV']
An Error Detection and Correction Framework for Connectomics,"We define and study error detection and correction tasks that are useful for 3D reconstruction of neurons from electron microscopic imagery, and for image segmentation more generally. Both tasks take as input the raw image and a binary mask representing a candidate object. For the error detection task, the desired output is a map of split and merge errors in the object. For the error correction task, the desired output is the true object. We call this object mask pruning, because the candidate object mask is assumed to be a superset of the true object. We train multiscale 3D convolutional networks to perform both tasks. We find that the error-detecting net can achieve high accuracy. The accuracy of the error-correcting net is enhanced if its input object mask is ""advice"" (union of erroneous objects) from the error-detecting net.",['cs.CV']
Clickstream analysis for crowd-based object segmentation with confidence,"With the rapidly increasing interest in machine learning based solutions for automatic image annotation, the availability of reference annotations for algorithm training is one of the major bottlenecks in the field. Crowdsourcing has evolved as a valuable option for low-cost and large-scale data annotation; however, quality control remains a major issue which needs to be addressed. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the annotation process to improve crowd-sourced image segmentation. Our method involves training a regressor to estimate the quality of a segmentation from the annotator's clickstream data. The quality estimation can be used to identify spam and weight individual annotations by their (estimated) quality when merging multiple segmentations of one image. Using a total of 29,000 crowd annotations performed on publicly available data of different object classes, we show that (1) our method is highly accurate in estimating the segmentation quality based on clickstream data, (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods for merging multiple annotations. As the regressor does not need to be trained on the object class that it is applied to it can be regarded as a low-cost option for quality control and confidence analysis in the context of crowd-based image annotation.",['cs.CV']
Efficient and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Dense Prediction,"Convolutional neural networks have shown great success on feature extraction from raw input data such as images. Although convolutional neural networks are invariant to translations on the inputs, they are not invariant to other transformations, including rotation and flip. Recent attempts have been made to incorporate more invariance in image recognition applications, but they are not applicable to dense prediction tasks, such as image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a set of methods based on kernel rotation and flip to enable rotation and flip invariance in convolutional neural networks. The kernel rotation can be achieved on kernels of 3 $\times$ 3, while kernel flip can be applied on kernels of any size. By rotating in eight or four angles, the convolutional layers could produce the corresponding number of feature maps based on eight or four different kernels. By using flip, the convolution layer can produce three feature maps. By combining produced feature maps using maxout, the resource requirement could be significantly reduced while still retain the invariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve various invariance at reasonable resource requirements in terms of both memory and time.",['cs.CV']
Curve-Structure Segmentation from Depth Maps: A CNN-based Approach and Its Application to Exploring Cultural Heritage Objects,"Motivated by the important archaeological application of exploring cultural heritage objects, in this paper we study the challenging problem of automatically segmenting curve structures that are very weakly stamped or carved on an object surface in the form of a highly noisy depth map. Different from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly learn and utilize more curve geometry and pattern information for addressing this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of curve structures and at each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of curve structures. In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of depth images scanned from unearthed pottery sherds dating to the Woodland period of Southeastern North America.",['cs.CV']
WAYLA - Generating Images from Eye Movements,"We present a method for reconstructing images viewed by observers based only on their eye movements. By exploring the relationships between gaze patterns and image stimuli, the ""What Are You Looking At?"" (WAYLA) system learns to synthesize photo-realistic images that are similar to the original pictures being viewed. The WAYLA approach is based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Conditional GAN) image-to-image translation technique of Isola et al. We consider two specific applications - the first, of reconstructing newspaper images from gaze heat maps, and the second, of detailed reconstruction of images containing only text. The newspaper image reconstruction process is divided into two image-to-image translation operations, the first mapping gaze heat maps into image segmentations, and the second mapping the generated segmentation into a newspaper image. We validate the performance of our approach using various evaluation metrics, along with human visual inspection. All results confirm the ability of our network to perform image generation tasks using eye tracking data.",['cs.CV']
SEGMENT3D: A Web-based Application for Collaborative Segmentation of 3D images used in the Shoot Apical Meristem,"The quantitative analysis of 3D confocal microscopy images of the shoot apical meristem helps understanding the growth process of some plants. Cell segmentation in these images is crucial for computational plant analysis and many automated methods have been proposed. However, variations in signal intensity across the image mitigate the effectiveness of those approaches with no easy way for user correction. We propose a web-based collaborative 3D image segmentation application, SEGMENT3D, to leverage automatic segmentation results. The image is divided into 3D tiles that can be either segmented interactively from scratch or corrected from a pre-existing segmentation. Individual segmentation results per tile are then automatically merged via consensus analysis and then stitched to complete the segmentation for the entire image stack. SEGMENT3D is a comprehensive application that can be applied to other 3D imaging modalities and general objects. It also provides an easy way to create supervised data to advance segmentation using machine learning models.",['cs.CV']
Improved Workflow for Unsupervised Multiphase Image Segmentation,"Quantitative image analysis often depends on accurate classification of pixels through a segmentation process. However, imaging artifacts such as the partial volume effect and sensor noise complicate the classification process. These effects increase the pixel intensity variance of each constituent class, causing intensities from one class to overlap with another. This increased variance makes threshold based segmentation methods insufficient due to ambiguous overlap regions in the pixel intensity distributions. The class ambiguity becomes even more complex for systems with more than two constituents, such as unsaturated moist granular media. In this paper, we propose an image processing workflow that improves segmentation accuracy for multiphase systems. First, the ambiguous transition regions between classes are identified and removed, which allows for global thresholding of single-class regions. Then the transition regions are classified using a distance function, and finally both segmentations are combined into one classified image. This workflow includes three methodologies for identifying transition pixels and we demonstrate on a variety of synthetic images that these approaches are able to accurately separate the ambiguous transition pixels from the single-class regions. For situations with typical amounts of image noise, misclassification errors and area differences calculated between each class of the synthetic images and the resultant segmented images range from 0.69-1.48% and 0.01-0.74%, respectively, showing the segmentation accuracy of this approach. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately segment x-ray microtomography images of moist granular media using these computationally efficient methodologies.",['cs.CV']
Texture Fuzzy Segmentation using Skew Divergence Adaptive Affinity Functions,"Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to different objects in a digital image, and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper, we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our method.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GR']"
Improving Dermoscopic Image Segmentation with Enhanced Convolutional-Deconvolutional Networks,"Automatic skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images is an essential step in computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. However, this task is challenging due to significant variations of lesion appearances across different patients. This challenge is further exacerbated when dealing with a large amount of image data. In this paper, we extended our previous work by developing a deeper network architecture with smaller kernels to enhance its discriminant capacity. In addition, we explicitly included color information from multiple color spaces to facilitate network training and thus to further improve the segmentation performance. We extensively evaluated our method on the ISBI 2017 skin lesion segmentation challenge. By training with the 2000 challenge training images, our method achieved an average Jaccard Index (JA) of 0.765 on the 600 challenge testing images, which ranked itself in the first place in the challenge",['cs.CV']
