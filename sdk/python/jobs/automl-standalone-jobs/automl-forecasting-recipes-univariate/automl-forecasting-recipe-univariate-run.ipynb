    "|**n_cross_validations**|Number of cross-validation folds to use for model/pipeline selection. The default value is \"auto\", in which case AutoMl determines the number of cross-validations automatically, if a validation set is not provided. Or, users could specify an integer value.|\n",
    "|**name**|The name of the Job/Run. This is an optional property. If not specified, a random name will be generated.\n",

This timeout includes setup, featurization and training runs but does not include the ensembling and model explainability runs at the end of the process since those actions need to happen once all the trials (children jobs) are done. If not specified, the default job's total timeout is 6 days (8,640 minutes). To specify a timeout less than or equal to 1 hour (60 minutes), make sure your dataset's size is not greater than 10,000,000 (rows times column) or an error results. It is hard to say what the timeout limit should be because the runtimes depend on multiple factors such as number of unique time series in the dataset, length of time series, statistical properties of the data, etc. If your dataset is less than 10,000,000 observations, you can try to set the experiment to 1 hour. If you are seeing less than 30 child jobs completed in this time frame, increase the timeout limit and re-run the experiment.|\n",

    "|**frequency**|Forecast frequency. This optional parameter represents the period with which the forecast is desired, for example, daily, weekly, yearly, etc. Use this parameter for the correction of time series containing irregular data points or for padding of short time series. The frequency needs to be a pandas offset alias.
