    "This notebook trains a model using prepared datasets derived from the CoNLL-2003 dataset, introduced by Sang et al. in [Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/introduction-to-the-conll-2003-shared-task). The derived version is available on KAGGLE: [CoNLL003 (English-version)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alaakhaled/conll003-englishversion?select=valid.txt). Below, we go over how you can use AutoML for training a Text NER model. We will use the CoNLL dataset to train, demonstrate how you can sweep over models to get the best-performing one for the task at hand, and deploy the model to use in inference scenarios."
