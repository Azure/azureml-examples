    "The objective of this notebook is to illustrate how to use the component-based AutoML single model solution. It walks you through all stages of model evaluation and production process starting with data ingestion and concluding with batch endpoint deployment for production. In this tutorial we will illustrate how to leverage AutoML and train a destributed TCN model ([link](placeholder)). However, the same notebook can be used to train a non-distributed TCN as well as the conventional ML models.\n",

    "We use a subset of UCI electricity data ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014#)) with the objective of predicting electricity demand per consumer 24 hours ahead. The data was preprocessed using the [data prep notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/v1/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/forecasting-data-preparation/auto-ml-forecasting-data-preparation.ipynb). Please refer to it for illustration on how to download the data from the source, aggregate to an hourly frequency, convert from wide to long format and upload to the Datastore. Here, we will work with the data that has been pre-processed and saved locally in the parquet format.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of steps you need to take before you can put a model into production. A user needs to prepare the data, partition it into appropriate sets, select the best model, evaluate it against a baseline, and monitor the model in real life to collect enough observations on how it would perform had it been put in production. Some of these steps are time consuming, some require certain expertise in writing code. The steps shown in this notebook follow a typical thought process one follows before the model is put in production.\n",
