    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](../../../resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](../../../resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create an `AutoML regression Job` with the 'regression()' factory-function.\n",
    "- Train the model using AmlCompute by submitting/running the AutoML regression training job\n",
    "- Obtaing the model and score predictions with it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML regression job. This is one of the nine ML-tasks supported by AutoML. Other ML-tasks are 'forecasting', 'classification', 'image classification', 'image object detection', 'nlp text classification', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use the Hardware Performance Dataset to showcase how you can use AutoML for a simple regression problem. The Regression goal is to predict the performance of certain combinations of hardware parts."

    "- `target_column_name` - The name of the column to target for predictions. It must always be specified. This parameter is applicable to 'training_data', 'validation_data' and 'test_data'.\n",
    "- `primary_metric` - The metric that AutoML will optimize for model selection.\n",
    "- `training_data` - The data to be used for training. It should contain both training feature columns and a target column. Optionally, this data can be split for segregating a validation or test dataset. \n",
    "You can use a registered MLTable in the workspace using the format '<mltable_name>:<version>' OR you can use a local file or folder as a MLTable. For e.g Input(mltable='my_mltable:1') OR Input(mltable=MLTable(local_path=\"./data\"))\n",
    "The parameter 'training_data' must always be provided.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the AutoML job will run. In this example we are using a compute called 'cpu-cluster' present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. \n",
    "- `name` - The name of the Job/Run. This is an optional property. If not specified, a random name will be generated.\n",
    "- `experiment_name` - The name of the Experiment. An Experiment is like a folder with multiple runs in Azure ML Workspace that should be related to the same logical machine learning experiment.\n",

    "### set_limits() parameters:\n",
    "This is an optional configuration method to configure limits parameters such as timeouts.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "- timeout_minutes - Maximum amount of time in minutes that the whole AutoML job can take before the job terminates. This timeout includes setup, featurization and training runs but does not include the ensembling and model explainability runs at the end of the process since those actions need to happen once all the trials (children jobs) are done. If not specified, the default job's total timeout is 6 days (8,640 minutes). To specify a timeout less than or equal to 1 hour (60 minutes), make sure your dataset's size is not greater than 10,000,000 (rows times column) or an error results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- trial_timeout_minutes - Maximum time in minutes that each trial (child job) can run for before it terminates. If not specified, a value of 1 month or 43200 minutes is used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- max_trials - The maximum number of trials/runs each with a different combination of algorithm and hyperparameters to try during an AutoML job. If not specified, the default is 1000 trials. If using 'enable_early_termination' the number of trials used can be smaller.\n",
    "    \n",
