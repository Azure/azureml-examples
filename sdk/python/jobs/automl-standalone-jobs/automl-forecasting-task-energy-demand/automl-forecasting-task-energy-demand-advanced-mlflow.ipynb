    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](../../../resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](../../../resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",

    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create an `AutoML time-series forecasting Job` with the 'forecasting()' factory-fuction\n",
    "- Train the model using AmlCompute by submitting/running the AutoML forecasting training job\n",
    "- Obtain the model and use it to generate forecast\n",

    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML forecasting job. This is one of the nine ML-tasks supported by AutoML. Other ML-tasks are 'regression', 'classification', 'image classification', 'image object detection', 'nlp text classification', etc.\n",

    "|**training_data**|The training data to be used for this experiment. You can use a registered MLTable in the workspace using the format `<mltable_name>:<version>` OR you can use a local file or folder as a MLTable. For e.g `Input(mltable='my_mltable:1')` OR `Input(mltable=MLTable(local_path=\"./data\"))` The parameter 'training_data' must always be provided.|\n",
    "|**compute**|The compute on which the AutoML job will run. In this example we are using a compute called 'energy-cluster-v2' present in the workspace. You can replace it with any other compute in the workspace.|\n",
    "|**n_cross_validations**|Number of cross-validation folds to use for model/pipeline selection. The default value is \"auto\", in which case AutoMl determines the number of cross-validations automatically, if a validation set is not provided. Or, users could specify an integer value.|\n",
    "|**name**|The name of the Job/Run. This is an optional property. If not specified, a random name will be generated.\n",
    "|**experiment_name**|The name of the Experiment. An Experiment is like a folder with multiple runs in Azure ML Workspace that should be related to the same logical machine learning experiment.

This timeout includes setup, featurization and training runs but does not include the ensembling and model explainability runs at the end of the process since those actions need to happen once all the trials (children jobs) are done. If not specified, the default job's total timeout is 6 days (8,640 minutes). To specify a timeout less than or equal to 1 hour (60 minutes), make sure your dataset's size is not greater than 10,000,000 (rows times column) or an error results. It is hard to say what the timeout limit should be because the runtimes depend on multiple factors such as number of unique time series in the dataset, length of time series, statistical properties of the data, etc. If your dataset is less than 10,000,000 observations, you can try to set the experiment to 1 hour. If you are seeing less than 30 child jobs completed in this time frame, increase the timeout limit and re-run the experiment.|\n",

    "|**max_trials**|The maximum number of trials/runs each with a different combination of algorithm and hyperparameters to try during an AutoML job. If not specified, the default is 1000 trials. If you are setting the `enable_early_termination=True` the number of trials will be smaller.|\n",
    "|**max_concurrent_trials**|Represents the maximum number of trials (children jobs) that would be executed in parallel. It's a good practice to set this number equal to the number of nodes in your cluster.|\n",
    "|**enable_early_termination**|Whether to enable early termination if the score is not improving over 10 iterations. Early stopping window starts only after first 20 iterations. This means that the first iteration where stopping can occur is the 31st.|\n",

    "|**frequency**|Forecast frequency. This optional parameter represents the period with which the forecast is desired, for example, daily, weekly, yearly, etc. Use this parameter for the correction of time series containing irregular data points or for padding of short time series. The frequency needs to be a pandas offset alias. Please refer to [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects) for more information.\n",

The `target_lags` keyword specifies how far back we will construct the lags of the target variable, and the `target_rolling_window_size` specifies the size of the rolling window over which we will generate the `max`, `min` and `sum` features.\n",
