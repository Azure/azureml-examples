    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](../../../resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](../../../resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create an `AutoML time-series forecasting Job` with the 'forecasting()' factory-fuction.\n",
    "- Train the model using AmlCompute by submitting/running the AutoML forecasting training job\n",
    "- Obtaing the model and score predictions with it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML forecasting job. This is one of the nine ML-tasks supported by AutoML. Other ML-tasks are 'regression', 'classification', 'image classification', 'image object detection', 'nlp text classification', etc.\n",

    "- `primary_metric` - The metric that AutoML will optimize for model selection.\n",

If not specified, the default job's total timeout is 6 days (8,640 minutes). To specify a timeout less than or equal to 1 hour (60 minutes), make sure your dataset's size is not greater than 10,000,000 (rows times column) or an error results.\n",

    "- max_trials - The maximum number of trials/runs each with a different combination of algorithm and hyperparameters to try during an AutoML job. If not specified, the default is 1000 trials. If using 'enable_early_termination' the number of trials used can be smaller.\n",
