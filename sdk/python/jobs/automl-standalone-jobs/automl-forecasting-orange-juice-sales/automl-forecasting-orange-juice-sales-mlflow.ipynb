    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](../../../resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb)\n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](../../../resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create an `AutoML time-series forecasting Job` with the 'forecasting()' factory-fuction.\n",
    "- Train the model using AmlCompute by submitting/running the AutoML forecasting training job\n",
    "- Obtaing the model and score predictions with it\n",

    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML forecasting job. This is one of the nine ML-tasks supported by AutoML. Other ML-tasks are 'regression', 'classification', 'image classification', 'image object detection', 'nlp text classification', etc.\n",

The supported imputing methods for target column are constant and ffill (forward fill). The supported imputing methods for feature columns are mean, median, most frequent, constant and ffill (forward fill). This customization can be used for the scenario that our customers know which imputation methods fit best to the input data. For instance, some datasets use NaN to represent 0 which the correct behavior should impute all the missing value with 0.
