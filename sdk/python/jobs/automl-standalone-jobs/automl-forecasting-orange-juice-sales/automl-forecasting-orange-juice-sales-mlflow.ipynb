        "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
        "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",

This customization can be used in the scenario that the type of the column cannot correctly reflect its purpose. Some numerical columns, for instance, can be treated as Categorical columns which need to be converted to categorical while some can be treated as epoch timestamp which need to be converted to datetime. To tell our SDK to correctly preprocess these columns, a configuration need to be add with the columns and their desired types.\n",

The supported imputing methods for target column are constant and ffill (forward fill). The supported imputing methods for feature columns are mean, median, most frequent, constant and ffill (forward fill). This customization can be used for the scenario that our customers know which imputation methods fit best to the input data. For instance, some datasets use NaN to represent 0 which the correct behavior should impute all the missing value with 0. To achieve this behavior, these columns need to be configured as constant imputation with `fill_value` 0."
