For e.g Input(mltable='my_mltable:1') OR Input(mltable=MLTable(local_path=\"./data\")) The parameter 'training_data' must always be provided.|\n",
    "|**compute**|The compute on which the AutoML job will run. In this example we are using a compute called 'cpu-cluster' present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace.|\n",
    "|**n_cross_validations**|Number of cross-validation folds to use for model/pipeline selection. The default value is \"auto\", in which case AutoMl determines the number of cross-validations automatically, if a validation set is not provided. Or users could specify an integer value.|\n",
