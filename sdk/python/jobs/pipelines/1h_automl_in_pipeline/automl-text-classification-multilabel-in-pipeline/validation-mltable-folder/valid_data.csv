Survey on Semantic Stereo Matching / Semantic Depth Estimation,"Stereo matching is one of the widely used techniques for inferring depth from stereo images owing to its robustness and speed. It has become one of the major topics of research since it finds its applications in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and many other fields. Finding pixel correspondences in non-textured, occluded and reflective areas is the major challenge in stereo matching. Recent developments have shown that semantic cues from image segmentation can be used to improve the results of stereo matching. Many deep neural network architectures have been proposed to leverage the advantages of semantic segmentation in stereo matching. This paper aims to give a comparison among the state of art networks both in terms of accuracy and in terms of speed which are of higher importance in real-time applications.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Future Medical Imaging,"The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation, image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i) Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying, developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Enforcing Mutual Consistency of Hard Regions for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to effectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive edges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple sightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new mutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the model's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant and low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order to learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation results of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Parameter Decoupling Strategy for Semi-supervised 3D Left Atrium Segmentation,"Consistency training has proven to be an advanced semi-supervised framework and achieved promising results in medical image segmentation tasks through enforcing an invariance of the predictions over different views of the inputs. However, with the iterative updating of model parameters, the models would tend to reach a coupled state and eventually lose the ability to exploit unlabeled data. To address the issue, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation model based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistent predictions from diverse views. Specifically, we first adopt a two-branch network to simultaneously produce predictions for each image. During the training process, we decouple the two prediction branch parameters by quadratic cosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this, the feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency of probability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features. In the overall training process, the parameters of feature extractor and classifiers are updated alternately by consistency regularization operation and decoupling operation to gradually improve the generalization performance of the model. Our method has achieved a competitive result over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Code is available at https://github.com/BX0903/PDC.",['cs.CV']
EdgeFlow: Achieving Practical Interactive Segmentation with Edge-Guided Flow,"High-quality training data play a key role in image segmentation tasks. Usually, pixel-level annotations are expensive, laborious and time-consuming for the large volume of training data. To reduce labelling cost and improve segmentation quality, interactive segmentation methods have been proposed, which provide the result with just a few clicks. However, their performance does not meet the requirements of practical segmentation tasks in terms of speed and accuracy. In this work, we propose EdgeFlow, a novel architecture that fully utilizes interactive information of user clicks with edge-guided flow. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without any post-processing or iterative optimization scheme. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, with the proposed method, we develop an efficient interactive segmentation tool for practical data annotation tasks. The source code and tool is avaliable at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg.","['cs.CV', 'cs.HC']"
Efficient Hybrid Transformer: Learning Global-local Context for Urban Sence Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of fine-resolution urban scene images plays a vital role in extensive practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urban change detection, environmental protection and economic assessment. Driven by rapid developments in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the semantic segmentation task for many years. Convolutional neural networks adopt hierarchical feature representation and have strong local context extraction. However, the local property of the convolution layer limits the network from capturing global information that is crucial for improving fine-resolution image segmentation. Recently, Transformer comprise a hot topic in the computer vision domain. Vision Transformer demonstrates the great capability of global information modelling, boosting many vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and especially semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid Transformer (EHT) for semantic segmentation of urban scene images. EHT takes advantage of CNNs and Transformer, learning global-local context to strengthen the feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EHT has higher efficiency with competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Specifically, the proposed EHT achieves a 67.0% mIoU on the UAVid test set and outperforms other lightweight models significantly. The code will be available soon.",['cs.CV']
Towards to Robust and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Framework,"To mitigate the radiologist's workload, computer-aided diagnosis with the capability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deep learning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use cases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications due to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the representation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed representations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and generalization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In particular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining architecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the generalization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned knowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image reconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the model to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on multi chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed framework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to corruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Semi-supervised Meta-learning with Disentanglement for Domain-generalised Medical Image Segmentation,"Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains) remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics (domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based meta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and meta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have shown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully supervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image segmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations. Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not approximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning framework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related to domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to reconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better approximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can achieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited amount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust on different segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisation performance on two public benchmarks.",['cs.CV']
UCTransNet: Rethinking the Skip Connections in U-Net from a Channel-wise Perspective with Transformer,"Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism. Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections, which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention (named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity. Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer or U-shaped framework.

From Contexts to Locality: Ultra-high Resolution Image Segmentation via Locality-aware Contextual Correlation,"Ultra-high resolution image segmentation has raised increasing interests in recent years due to its realistic applications. In this paper, we innovate the widely used high-resolution image segmentation pipeline, in which an ultra-high resolution image is partitioned into regular patches for local segmentation and then the local results are merged into a high-resolution semantic mask. In particular, we introduce a novel locality-aware contextual correlation based segmentation model to process local patches, where the relevance between local patch and its various contexts are jointly and complementarily utilized to handle the semantic regions with large variations. Additionally, we present a contextual semantics refinement network that associates the local segmentation result with its contextual semantics, and thus is endowed with the ability of reducing boundary artifacts and refining mask contours during the generation of final high-resolution mask. Furthermore, in comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks. Our released codes are available at https://github.com/liqiokkk/FCtL.",['cs.CV']
"A Critical Connectivity Radius for Segmenting Randomly-Generated, High Dimensional Data Points","Motivated by a $2$-dimensional (unsupervised) image segmentation task whereby local regions of pixels are clustered via edge detection methods, a more general probabilistic mathematical framework is devised. Critical thresholds are calculated that indicate strong correlation between randomly-generated, high dimensional data points that have been projected into structures in a partition of a bounded, $2$-dimensional area, of which, an image is a special case. A neighbor concept for structures in the partition is defined and a critical radius is uncovered. Measured from a central structure in localized regions of the partition, the radius indicates strong, long and short range correlation in the count of occupied structures. The size of a short interval of radii is estimated upon which the transition from short-to-long range correlation is virtually assured, which defines a demarcation of when an image ceases to be ""interesting"".",['cs.LG']
Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models trained on public datasets have achieved great success in recent years. However, these models didn't consider the personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled personalized images by investigating the data's personalized traits. To open up future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on the proposed dataset. The code and the PIS dataset will be made publicly available.",['cs.CV']
Box-Adapt: Domain-Adaptive Medical Image Segmentation using Bounding BoxSupervision,"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medicalimage segmentation, but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained segmentation masks, andthe annotation of these masks can be very expensive andtime-consuming. Therefore, recent methods try to use un-supervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other datasets (source do-mains) to a new dataset (target domain). However, due tothe absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than segmentation masks. Accordingly, we proposea new weakly-supervised domain adaptation method calledBox-Adapt, which fully explores the fine-grained segmenta-tion mask in the source domain and the weak bounding boxin the target domain. Our Box-Adapt is a two-stage methodthat first performs joint training on the source and target do-mains, and then conducts self-training with the pseudo-labelsof the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourmethod in the liver segmentation task. Weakly supervised do-main adaptation",['cs.CV']
ISNet: Integrate Image-Level and Semantic-Level Context for Semantic Segmentation,"Co-occurrent visual pattern makes aggregating contextual information a common paradigm to enhance the pixel representation for semantic image segmentation. The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of the whole image, i.e., aggregating the image-level contextual information. Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual information. To address this, this paper proposes to augment the pixel representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second, we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this paper to report state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, LIP, COCOStuff and Cityscapes.",['cs.CV']
Mining Contextual Information Beyond Image for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper studies the context aggregation problem in semantic image segmentation. The existing researches focus on improving the pixel representations by aggregating the contextual information within individual images. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the representations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input image. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training, to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN, PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements. Mining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff.",['cs.CV']
Deep Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision: A Comprehensive Survey,"Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research directions on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Duo-SegNet: Adversarial Dual-Views for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Segmentation of images is a long-standing challenge in medical AI. This is mainly due to the fact that training a neural network to perform image segmentation requires a significant number of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised image segmentation technique based on the concept of multi-view learning. In contrast to the previous art, we introduce an adversarial form of dual-view training and employ a critic to formulate the learning problem in multi-view training as a min-max problem. Thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluations on several datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation algorithms consistently and comfortably. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/himashi92/Duo-SegNet",['cs.CV']
Self-Paced Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Meta-labels,"Pre-training a recognition model with contrastive learning on a large dataset of unlabeled data has shown great potential to boost the performance of a downstream task, e.g., image classification. However, in domains such as medical imaging, collecting unlabeled data can be challenging and expensive. In this work, we propose to adapt contrastive learning to work with meta-label annotations, for improving the model's performance in medical image segmentation even when no additional unlabeled data is available. Meta-labels such as the location of a 2D slice in a 3D MRI scan or the type of device used, often come for free during the acquisition process. We use the meta-labels for pre-training the image encoder as well as to regularize a semi-supervised training, in which a reduced set of annotated data is used for training. Finally, to fully exploit the weak annotations, a self-paced learning approach is used to help the learning and discriminate useful labels from noise. Results on three different medical image segmentation datasets show that our approach: i) highly boosts the performance of a model trained on a few scans, ii) outperforms previous contrastive and semi-supervised approaches, and iii) reaches close to the performance of a model trained on the full data.",['cs.CV']
Membership Inference Attacks are Easier on Difficult Problems,"Membership inference attacks (MIA) try to detect if data samples were used to train a neural network model, e.g. to detect copyright abuses. We show that models with higher dimensional input and output are more vulnerable to MIA, and address in more detail models for image translation and semantic segmentation, including medical image segmentation. We show that reconstruction-errors can lead to very effective MIA attacks as they are indicative of memorization. Unfortunately, reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating between non-predictable images used in training and easy to predict images that were never seen before. To overcome this, we propose using a novel predictability error that can be computed for each sample, and its computation does not require a training set. Our membership error, obtained by subtracting the predictability error from the reconstruction error, is shown to achieve high MIA accuracy on an extensive number of benchmarks.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CR']"
SimCVD: Simple Contrastive Voxel-Wise Representation Distillation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Real-Time Multi-Modal Semantic Fusion on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple complementary sensors have tremendous potential for fast autonomous or remote-controlled semantic scene analysis, e.g., for disaster examination. In this work, we propose a UAV system for real-time semantic inference and fusion of multiple sensor modalities. Semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans and RGB images, as well as object detection on RGB and thermal images, run online onboard the UAV computer using lightweight CNN architectures and embedded inference accelerators. We follow a late fusion approach where semantic information from multiple modalities augments 3D point clouds and image segmentation masks while also generating an allocentric semantic map. Our system provides augmented semantic images and point clouds with $\approx\,$9$\,$Hz. We evaluate the integrated system in real-world experiments in an urban environment.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
Few-Shot Segmentation with Global and Local Contrastive Learning,"In this work, we address the challenging task of few-shot segmentation. Previous few-shot segmentation methods mainly employ the information of support images as guidance for query image segmentation. Although some works propose to build cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of query information still depends on the support images. We here propose to extract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the few-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to learn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed global-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined priors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the limitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve better interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on PASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets.",['cs.CV']
AASeg: Attention Aware Network for Real Time Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a new network named Attention Aware Network (AASeg) for real time semantic image segmentation. Our network incorporates spatial and channel information using Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA) modules respectively. It also uses dense local multi-scale context information using Multi Scale Context (MSC) module. The feature maps are concatenated individually to produce the final segmentation map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a comprehensive analysis, quantitative experimental results and ablation study using Cityscapes, ADE20K and Camvid datasets. Our network performs better than most previous architectures with a 74.4\% Mean IOU on Cityscapes test dataset while running at 202.7 FPS.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning for 2D Medical Image Segmentation,"Contrastive Learning (CL) is a recent representation learning approach, which encourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned image representations. Since medical images often contain multiple semantic classes in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as opposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image patches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed using the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo labeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which works in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and encourages better clustering in the feature space. We evaluate our method on four public medical segmentation datasets and a novel histopathology dataset that we introduce. Our method obtains consistent improvements over state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches for all datasets.",['cs.CV']
Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation,"Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains. However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived from anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall loss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the target images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios, with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and cardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of the art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information, as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular adversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting. Our framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and our code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA",['cs.CV']
Efficient and Generic Interactive Segmentation Framework to Correct Mispredictions during Clinical Evaluation of Medical Images,"Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and 12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus, multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other interactive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the medical expert. The source-code and the detailed results are available here [1].",['cs.CV']
"Distribution-Free, Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets","While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making. Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise uncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued predictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future test points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit finite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate the size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple, distribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it in five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems where some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label classification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3) classification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4) image segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an object of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss extensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and distributionally robust learning.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
Recurrent Mask Refinement for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"Although having achieved great success in medical image segmentation, deep convolutional neural networks usually require a large dataset with manual annotations for training and are difficult to generalize to unseen classes. Few-shot learning has the potential to address these challenges by learning new classes from only a few labeled examples. In this work, we propose a new framework for few-shot medical image segmentation based on prototypical networks. Our innovation lies in the design of two key modules: 1) a context relation encoder (CRE) that uses correlation to capture local relation features between foreground and background regions; and 2) a recurrent mask refinement module that repeatedly uses the CRE and a prototypical network to recapture the change of context relationship and refine the segmentation mask iteratively. Experiments on two abdomen CT datasets and an abdomen MRI dataset show the proposed method obtains substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 16.32%, 8.45% and 6.24% in terms of DSC, respectively. Code is publicly available.",['cs.CV']
Transductive image segmentation: Self-training and effect of uncertainty estimation,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data during training to learn better models. Previous studies on SSL for medical image segmentation focused mostly on improving model generalization to unseen data. In some applications, however, our primary interest is not generalization but to obtain optimal predictions on a specific unlabeled database that is fully available during model development. Examples include population studies for extracting imaging phenotypes. This work investigates an often overlooked aspect of SSL, transduction. It focuses on the quality of predictions made on the unlabeled data of interest when they are included for optimization during training, rather than improving generalization. We focus on the self-training framework and explore its potential for transduction. We analyze it through the lens of Information Gain and reveal that learning benefits from the use of calibrated or under-confident models. Our extensive experiments on a large MRI database for multi-class segmentation of traumatic brain lesions shows promising results when comparing transductive with inductive predictions. We believe this study will inspire further research on transductive learning, a well-suited paradigm for medical image analysis.",['cs.CV']
Visual Boundary Knowledge Translation for Foreground Segmentation,"When confronted with objects of unknown types in an image, humans can effortlessly and precisely tell their visual boundaries. This recognition mechanism and underlying generalization capability seem to contrast to state-of-the-art image segmentation networks that rely on large-scale category-aware annotated training samples. In this paper, we make an attempt towards building models that explicitly account for visual boundary knowledge, in hope to reduce the training effort on segmenting unseen categories. Specifically, we investigate a new task termed as Boundary Knowledge Translation (BKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, BKT aims to translate the visual boundary knowledge learned from the labeled categories, to a set of novel categories, each of which is provided only a few labeled samples. To this end, we propose a Translation Segmentation Network (Trans-Net), which comprises a segmentation network and two boundary discriminators. The segmentation network, combined with a boundary-aware self-supervised mechanism, is devised to conduct foreground segmentation, while the two discriminators work together in an adversarial manner to ensure an accurate segmentation of the novel categories under light supervision. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only tens of labeled samples as guidance, Trans-Net achieves close results on par with fully supervised methods.",['cs.CV']
OPFython: A Python-Inspired Optimum-Path Forest Classifier,"Machine learning techniques have been paramount throughout the last years, being applied in a wide range of tasks, such as classification, object recognition, person identification, and image segmentation. Nevertheless, conventional classification algorithms, e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Bayesian classifiers, might lack complexity and diversity, not suitable when dealing with real-world data. A recent graph-inspired classifier, known as the Optimum-Path Forest, has proven to be a state-of-the-art technique, comparable to Support Vector Machines and even surpassing it in some tasks. This paper proposes a Python-based Optimum-Path Forest framework, denoted as OPFython, where all of its functions and classes are based upon the original C language implementation. Additionally, as OPFython is a Python-based library, it provides a more friendly environment and a faster prototyping workspace than the C language.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
"Comprehensive Validation of Automated Whole Body Skeletal Muscle, Adipose Tissue, and Bone Segmentation from 3D CT images for Body Composition Analysis: Towards Extended Body Composition","The latest advances in computer-assisted precision medicine are making it feasible to move from population-wide models that are useful to discover aggregate patterns that hold for group-based analysis to patient-specific models that can drive patient-specific decisions with regard to treatment choices, and predictions of outcomes of treatment. Body Composition is recognized as an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of diseases, as well as a predictor of individual patient-specific clinical outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering of internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the amount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of artificial intelligence such as deep learning are making it feasible now to segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all internal anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed previously, namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to scale to the hundreds of 2D axial slices that made up a 3D volumetric image. Automated tools such as presented here will now enable harvesting whole-body measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of the drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape, and functional status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby limiting the field to a very small and limited subset. These discoveries and the potential to perform individual image segmentation with high speed and accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into individual specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging, chemotoxicity, surgery and survival after the onset of a major disease such as cancer.",['cs.CV']
Crosslink-Net: Double-branch Encoder Segmentation Network via Fusing Vertical and Horizontal Convolutions,"Accurate image segmentation plays a crucial role in medical image analysis, yet it faces great challenges of various shapes, diverse sizes, and blurry boundaries. To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder architecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets. The code is released at https://github.com/Qianyu1226/Crosslink-Net.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Reservoir Computing Approach for Gray Images Segmentation,"The paper proposes a novel approach for gray scale images segmentation. It is based on multiple features extraction from single feature per image pixel, namely its intensity value, using Echo state network. The newly extracted features -- reservoir equilibrium states -- reveal hidden image characteristics that improve its segmentation via a clustering algorithm. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the intrinsic plasticity tuning of reservoir fits its equilibrium states to the original image intensity distribution thus allowing for its better segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on the benchmark image Lena.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Superpixel-guided Iterative Learning from Noisy Labels for Medical Image Segmentation,"Learning segmentation from noisy labels is an important task for medical image analysis due to the difficulty in acquiring highquality annotations. Most existing methods neglect the pixel correlation and structural prior in segmentation, often producing noisy predictions around object boundaries. To address this, we adopt a superpixel representation and develop a robust iterative learning strategy that combines noise-aware training of segmentation network and noisy label refinement, both guided by the superpixels. This design enables us to exploit the structural constraints in segmentation labels and effectively mitigate the impact of label noise in learning. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches, and achieves superior robustness in a wide range of label noises. Code is available at https://github.com/gaozhitong/SP_guided_Noisy_Label_Seg.",['cs.CV']
Weighted Intersection over Union (wIoU): A New Evaluation Metric for Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric for performance evaluation of semantic segmentation. In recent years, many studies have tried to train pixel-level classifiers on large-scale image datasets to perform accurate semantic segmentation. The goal of semantic segmentation is to assign a class label of each pixel in the scene. It has various potential applications in computer vision fields e.g., object detection, classification, scene understanding and Etc. To validate the proposed wIoU evaluation metric, we tested state-of-the art methods on public benchmark datasets (e.g., KITTI) based on the proposed wIoU metric and compared with other conventional evaluation metrics.",['cs.CV']
What Image Features Boost Housing Market Predictions?,"The attractiveness of a property is one of the most interesting, yet challenging, categories to model. Image characteristics are used to describe certain attributes, and to examine the influence of visual factors on the price or timeframe of the listing. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques for the extraction of visual features for efficient numerical inclusion in modern-day predictive algorithms. We discuss techniques such as Shannon's entropy, calculating the center of gravity, employing image segmentation, and using Convolutional Neural Networks. After comparing these techniques as applied to a set of property-related images (indoor, outdoor, and satellite), we conclude the following: (i) the entropy is the most efficient single-digit visual measure for housing price prediction; (ii) image segmentation is the most important visual feature for the prediction of housing lifespan; and (iii) deep image features can be used to quantify interior characteristics and contribute to captivation modeling. The set of 40 image features selected here carries a significant amount of predictive power and outperforms some of the strongest metadata predictors. Without any need to replace a human expert in a real-estate appraisal process, we conclude that the techniques presented in this paper can efficiently describe visible characteristics, thus introducing perceived attractiveness as a quantitative measure into the predictive modeling of housing.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Learning from Partially Overlapping Labels: Image Segmentation under Annotation Shift,"Scarcity of high quality annotated images remains a limiting factor for training accurate image segmentation models. While more and more annotated datasets become publicly available, the number of samples in each individual database is often small. Combining different databases to create larger amounts of training data is appealing yet challenging due to the heterogeneity as a result of differences in data acquisition and annotation processes, often yielding incompatible or even conflicting information. In this paper, we investigate and propose several strategies for learning from partially overlapping labels in the context of abdominal organ segmentation. We find that combining a semi-supervised approach with an adaptive cross entropy loss can successfully exploit heterogeneously annotated data and substantially improve segmentation accuracy compared to baseline and alternative approaches.",['cs.CV']
TransClaw U-Net: Claw U-Net with Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation,"In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis has become an increasingly popular topic. Methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved good performance in medical image segmentation and classification. Due to the limitations of the convolution operation, the long-term spatial features are often not accurately obtained. Hence, we propose a TransClaw U-Net network structure, which combines the convolution operation with the transformer operation in the encoding part. The convolution part is applied for extracting the shallow spatial features to facilitate the recovery of the image resolution after upsampling. The transformer part is used to encode the patches, and the self-attention mechanism is used to obtain global information between sequences. The decoding part retains the bottom upsampling structure for better detail segmentation performance. The experimental results on Synapse Multi-organ Segmentation Datasets show that the performance of TransClaw U-Net is better than other network structures. The ablation experiments also prove the generalization performance of TransClaw U-Net.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Anatomy of Domain Shift Impact on U-Net Layers in MRI Segmentation,"Domain Adaptation (DA) methods are widely used in medical image segmentation tasks to tackle the problem of differently distributed train (source) and test (target) data. We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of annotated samples from the target domain. It corresponds to one of the most relevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum possible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific layers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is no consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for images with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with high-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture that automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned. More specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the policy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused from the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level as the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme scarcity of annotated data. Secondly, we show that SpotTUnet policy provides a layer-wise visualization of the domain shift impact on the network, which could be further used to develop robust domain generalization methods. In order to extensively evaluate SpotTUnet performance, we use a publicly available dataset of brain MR images (CC359), characterized by explicit domain shift. We release a reproducible experimental pipeline.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation Based on Multi-Domain Data Aggregation,"A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning, but for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain sufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated images are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on task-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning, we utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for various medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a self-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new loss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and pretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive experiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream segmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly. Compared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on various tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially bridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of annotated data).",['cs.CV']
Towards Robust General Medical Image Segmentation,"The reliability of Deep Learning systems depends on their accuracy but also on their robustness against adversarial perturbations to the input data. Several attacks and defenses have been proposed to improve the performance of Deep Neural Networks under the presence of adversarial noise in the natural image domain. However, robustness in computer-aided diagnosis for volumetric data has only been explored for specific tasks and with limited attacks. We propose a new framework to assess the robustness of general medical image segmentation systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we propose a new benchmark to evaluate robustness in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) by extending the recent AutoAttack natural image classification framework to the domain of volumetric data segmentation, and (ii) we present a novel lattice architecture for RObust Generic medical image segmentation (ROG). Our results show that ROG is capable of generalizing across different tasks of the MSD and largely surpasses the state-of-the-art under sophisticated adversarial attacks.",['cs.CV']
Medical Matting: A New Perspective on Medical Segmentation with Uncertainty,"In medical image segmentation, it is difficult to mark ambiguous areas accurately with binary masks, especially when dealing with small lesions. Therefore, it is a challenge for radiologists to reach a consensus by using binary masks under the condition of multiple annotations. However, these areas may contain anatomical structures that are conducive to diagnosis. Uncertainty is introduced to study these situations. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is usually measured by the variances between predictions in a multiple trial way. It is not intuitive, and there is no exact correspondence in the image. Inspired by image matting, we introduce matting as a soft segmentation method and a new perspective to deal with and represent uncertain regions into medical scenes, namely medical matting. More specifically, because there is no available medical matting dataset, we first labeled two medical datasets with alpha matte. Secondly, the matting method applied to the natural image is not suitable for the medical scene, so we propose a new architecture to generate binary masks and alpha matte in a row. Thirdly, the uncertainty map is introduced to highlight the ambiguous regions from the binary results and improve the matting performance. Evaluated on these datasets, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art matting algorithms by a large margin, and alpha matte is proved to be a more efficient labeling form than a binary mask.",['cs.CV']
A Deep Learning Object Detection Method for an Efficient Clusters Initialization,"Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples into clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in numerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval, image segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the existing clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is the dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g. number of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the literature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation metrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and memory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we apply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to detect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with their sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a DL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of initialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated clusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the incoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that the proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization parameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing solutions.",['cs.CV']
Segmentation with Multiple Acceptable Annotations: A Case Study of Myocardial Segmentation in Contrast Echocardiography,"Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume that a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation. This is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic myocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and serious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can vary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case, how can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we train the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by proposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation performance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our proposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new metric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn general features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set demonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function outperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from multiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our grading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better identify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using Dice.",['cs.CV']
Are conditional GANs explicitly conditional?,"This paper proposes two important contributions for conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to improve the wide variety of applications that exploit this architecture. The first main contribution is an analysis of cGANs to show that they are not explicitly conditional. In particular, it will be shown that the discriminator and subsequently the cGAN does not automatically learn the conditionality between inputs. The second contribution is a new method, called acontrario, that explicitly models conditionality for both parts of the adversarial architecture via a novel acontrario loss that involves training the discriminator to learn unconditional (adverse) examples. This leads to a novel type of data augmentation approach for GANs (acontrario learning) which allows to restrict the search space of the generator to conditional outputs using adverse examples. Extensive experimentation is carried out to evaluate the conditionality of the discriminator by proposing a probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN architecture for different applications show significant improvements in performance on well known datasets including, semantic image synthesis, image segmentation and monocular depth prediction using different metrics including Fr\'echet Inception Distance(FID), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Root Mean Square Error log (RMSE log) and Number of statistically-Different Bins (NDB)","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Attention Toward Neighbors: A Context Aware Framework for High Resolution Image Segmentation,"High-resolution image segmentation remains challenging and error-prone due to the enormous size of intermediate feature maps. Conventional methods avoid this problem by using patch based approaches where each patch is segmented independently. However, independent patch segmentation induces errors, particularly at the patch boundary due to the lack of contextual information in very high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to the full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual information from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network to see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger feature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our proposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly improved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy.",['cs.CV']
Adapting Off-the-Shelf Source Segmenter for Target Medical Image Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf"" segmentation model pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g., self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods with the source data.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Transformer Meets Convolution: A Bilateral Awareness Net-work for Semantic Segmentation of Very Fine Resolution Ur-ban Scene Images,"Semantic segmentation from very fine resolution (VFR) urban scene images plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the tremendous details contained in the VFR image severely limit the potential of the existing deep learning approaches. More seriously, the considerable variations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the representational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to the confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this manuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is built on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid dataset, demonstrate the effective-ness of our BANet. Specifically, a 64.6% mIoU is achieved on the UAVid dataset.",['cs.CV']
Automatic Head Overcoat Thickness Measure with NASNet-Large-Decoder Net,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the primary tools to show microstructural characterization of materials as well as film thickness. However, manual determination of film thickness from TEM images is time-consuming as well as subjective, especially when the films in question are very thin and the need for measurement precision is very high. Such is the case for head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive industry. It is therefore necessary to develop software to automatically measure HOC thickness. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a HOC layer segmentation method using NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in deep learning for image segmentation. To further improve segmentation results, we are the first to propose a post-processing layer to remove irrelevant portions in the segmentation result. To measure the thickness of the segmented HOC layer, we propose a regressive convolutional neural network (RCNN) model as well as orthogonal thickness calculation methods. Experimental results demonstrate a higher dice score for our model which has lower mean squared error and outperforms current state-of-the-art manual measurement.",['cs.CV']
Improving Multi-Modal Learning with Uni-Modal Teachers,"Learning multi-modal representations is an essential step towards real-world robotic applications, and various multi-modal fusion models have been developed for this purpose. However, we observe that existing models, whose objectives are mostly based on joint training, often suffer from learning inferior representations of each modality. We name this problem Modality Failure, and hypothesize that the imbalance of modalities and the implicit bias of common objectives in fusion method prevent encoders of each modality from sufficient feature learning. To this end, we propose a new multi-modal learning method, Uni-Modal Teacher, which combines the fusion objective and uni-modal distillation to tackle the modality failure problem. We show that our method not only drastically improves the representation of each modality, but also improves the overall multi-modal task performance. Our method can be effectively generalized to most multi-modal fusion approaches. We achieve more than 3% improvement on the VGGSound audio-visual classification task, as well as improving performance on the NYU depth V2 RGB-D image segmentation task.",['cs.LG']
Positional Contrastive Learning for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation,"The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large labeled training sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in medical image domain because of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling efforts. Contrastive learning, an unsupervised learning technique, has been proved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data. The learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the performance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in contrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is relatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for medical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ across the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation, most state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a lot of false-negative pairs and result in degraded segmentation quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel positional contrastive learning (PCL) framework to generate contrastive data pairs by leveraging the position information in volumetric medical images. Experimental results on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed PCL method can substantially improve the segmentation performance compared to existing methods in both semi-supervised setting and transfer learning setting.",['cs.CV']
Trilateral Attention Network for Real-time Medical Image Segmentation,"Accurate segmentation of medical images into anatomically meaningful regions is critical for the extraction of quantitative indices or biomarkers. The common pipeline for segmentation comprises regions of interest detection stage and segmentation stage, which are independent of each other and typically performed using separate deep learning networks. The performance of the segmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and the receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called Trilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation in medical images. TaNet has a module for region localization, and three segmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional kernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global pathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich handcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular kernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By jointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different sets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and speed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation. The code and models will be made publicly available in TaNet Github page.",['cs.CV']
CMF: Cascaded Multi-model Fusion for Referring Image Segmentation,"In this work, we address the task of referring image segmentation (RIS), which aims at predicting a segmentation mask for the object described by a natural language expression. Most existing methods focus on establishing unidirectional or directional relationships between visual and linguistic features to associate two modalities together, while the multi-scale context is ignored or insufficiently modeled. Multi-scale context is crucial to localize and segment those objects that have large scale variations during the multi-modal fusion process. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective Cascaded Multi-modal Fusion (CMF) module, which stacks multiple atrous convolutional layers in parallel and further introduces a cascaded branch to fuse visual and linguistic features. The cascaded branch can progressively integrate multi-scale contextual information and facilitate the alignment of two modalities during the multi-modal fusion process. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jianhua2022/CMF-Refseg.",['cs.CV']
Optimal Latent Vector Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation,"This paper addresses the domain shift problem for segmentation. As a solution, we propose OLVA, a novel and lightweight unsupervised domain adaptation method based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Optimal Transport (OT) theory. Thanks to the VAE, our model learns a shared cross-domain latent space that follows a normal distribution, which reduces the domain shift. To guarantee valid segmentations, our shared latent space is designed to model the shape rather than the intensity variations. We further rely on an OT loss to match and align the remaining discrepancy between the two domains in the latent space. We demonstrate OLVA's effectiveness for the segmentation of multiple cardiac structures on the public Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) dataset, where the source domain consists of annotated 3D MR images and the unlabelled target domain of 3D CTs. Our results show remarkable improvements with an additional margin of 12.5\% dice score over concurrent generative training approaches.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']"
A Hybrid mmWave and Camera System for Long-Range Depth Imaging,"mmWave radars offer excellent depth resolution owing to their high bandwidth at mmWave radio frequencies. Yet, they suffer intrinsically from poor angular resolution, that is an order-of-magnitude worse than camera systems, and are therefore not a capable 3-D imaging solution in isolation. We propose Metamoran, a system that combines the complimentary strengths of radar and camera systems to obtain depth images at high azimuthal resolutions at distances of several tens of meters with high accuracy, all from a single fixed vantage point. Metamoran enables rich long-range depth imaging outdoors with applications to roadside safety infrastructure, surveillance and wide-area mapping. Our key insight is to use the high azimuth resolution from cameras using computer vision techniques, including image segmentation and monocular depth estimation, to obtain object shapes and use these as priors for our novel specular beamforming algorithm. We also design this algorithm to work in cluttered environments with weak reflections and in partially occluded scenarios. We perform a detailed evaluation of Metamoran's depth imaging and sensing capabilities in 200 diverse scenes at a major U.S. city. Our evaluation shows that Metamoran estimates the depth of an object up to 60~m away with a median error of 28~cm, an improvement of 13$\times$ compared to a naive radar+camera baseline and 23$\times$ compared to monocular depth estimation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO', 'eess.SP']"
Bayesian dense inverse searching algorithm for real-time stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery,"This paper reports a CPU-level real-time stereo matching method for surgical images (10 Hz on 640 * 480 image with a single core of i5-9400). The proposed method is built on the fast ''dense inverse searching'' algorithm, which estimates the disparity of the stereo images. The overlapping image patches (arbitrary squared image segment) from the images at different scales are aligned based on the photometric consistency presumption. We propose a Bayesian framework to evaluate the probability of the optimized patch disparity at different scales. Moreover, we introduce a spatial Gaussian mixed probability distribution to address the pixel-wise probability within the patch. In-vivo and synthetic experiments show that our method can handle ambiguities resulted from the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency caused by the Lambertian reflectance. Our Bayesian method correctly balances the probability of the patch for stereo images at different scales. Experiments indicate that the estimated depth has higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline methods in the surgical scenario.",['cs.CV']
DS-TransUNet:Dual Swin Transformer U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation,"Automatic medical image segmentation has made great progress benefit from the development of deep learning. However, most existing methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fail to build long-range dependencies and global context connections due to the limitation of receptive field in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in modeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended considerable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based U-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores the pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework called Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first attempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin Transformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture to enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike many prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts dual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse and fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the core component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive Fusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies between features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to further explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling process. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
RLCorrector: Reinforced Proofreading for Connectomics Image Segmentation,"The segmentation of nanoscale electron microscopy (EM) images is crucial but challenging in connectomics. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated the significant potential of automatic segmentation for tera-scale EM images. However, none of the existing segmentation methods are error-free, and they require proofreading, which is typically implemented as an interactive, semi-automatic process via manual intervention. Herein, we propose a fully automatic proofreading method based on reinforcement learning. The main idea is to model the human decision process in proofreading using a reinforcement agent to achieve fully automatic proofreading. We systematically design the proposed system by combining multiple reinforcement learning agents in a hierarchical manner, where each agent focuses only on a specific task while preserving dependency between agents. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the episodic task setting of reinforcement learning can efficiently manage a combination of merge and split errors concurrently presented in the input. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system by comparing it with state-of-the-art proofreading methods using various testing examples.",['cs.CV']
Few-shot segmentation of medical images based on meta-learning with implicit gradients,"Classical supervised methods commonly used often suffer from the requirement of an abudant number of training samples and are unable to generalize on unseen datasets. As a result, the broader application of any trained model is very limited in clinical settings. However, few-shot approaches can minimize the need for enormous reliable ground truth labels that are both labor intensive and expensive. To this end, we propose to exploit an optimization-based implicit model agnostic meta-learning {iMAML} algorithm in a few-shot setting for medical image segmentation. Our approach can leverage the learned weights from a diverse set of training samples and can be deployed on a new unseen dataset. We show that unlike classical few-shot learning approaches, our method has improved generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits iMAML for medical image segmentation. Our quantitative results on publicly available skin and polyp datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the naive supervised baseline model and two recent few-shot segmentation approaches by large margins.",['cs.CV']
Using GANs to Augment Data for Cloud Image Segmentation Task,"While cloud/sky image segmentation has extensive real-world applications, a large amount of labelled data is needed to train a highly accurate models to perform the task. Scarcity of such volumes of cloud/sky images with corresponding ground-truth binary maps makes it highly difficult to train such complex image segmentation models. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate data to augment the training set in order to increase the prediction accuracy of image segmentation model. We further present a way to estimate ground-truth binary maps for the GAN-generated images to facilitate their effective use as augmented images. Finally, we validate our work with different statistical techniques.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Adaptive and Progressive Feature Alignment,"Contemporary domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to address data annotation challenges by assuming that target domains are completely unannotated. However, annotating a few target samples is usually very manageable and worthwhile especially if it improves the adaptation performance substantially. This paper presents SSDAS, a Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptive image Segmentation network that employs a few labeled target samples as anchors for adaptive and progressive feature alignment between labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. We position the few labeled target samples as references that gauge the similarity between source and target features and guide adaptive inter-domain alignment for learning more similar source features. In addition, we replace the dissimilar source features by high-confidence target features continuously during the iterative training process, which achieves progressive intra-domain alignment between confident and unconfident target features. Extensive experiments show the proposed SSDAS greatly outperforms a number of baselines, i.e., UDA-based semantic segmentation and SSDA-based image classification. In addition, SSDAS is complementary and can be easily incorporated into UDA-based methods with consistent improvements in domain adaptive semantic segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Points2Polygons: Context-Based Segmentation from Weak Labels Using Adversarial Networks,"In applied image segmentation tasks, the ability to provide numerous and precise labels for training is paramount to the accuracy of the model at inference time. However, this overhead is often neglected, and recently proposed segmentation architectures rely heavily on the availability and fidelity of ground truth labels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies. Failure to acknowledge the difficulty in creating adequate ground truths can lead to an over-reliance on pre-trained models or a lack of adoption in real-world applications. We introduce Points2Polygons (P2P), a model which makes use of contextual metric learning techniques that directly addresses this problem. Points2Polygons performs well against existing fully-supervised segmentation baselines with limited training data, despite using lightweight segmentation models (U-Net with a ResNet18 backbone) and having access to only weak labels in the form of object centroids and no pre-training. We demonstrate this on several different small but non-trivial datasets. We show that metric learning using contextual data provides key insights for self-supervised tasks in general, and allow segmentation models to easily generalize across traditionally label-intensive domains in computer vision.",['cs.CV']
IPatch: A Remote Adversarial Patch,"Applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical screening use deep learning models to localize and identify hundreds of objects in a single frame. In the past, it has been shown how an attacker can fool these models by placing an adversarial patch within a scene. However, these patches must be placed in the target location and do not explicitly alter the semantics elsewhere in the image.   In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a model's perception of an image's semantics. These patches can be placed anywhere within an image to change the classification or semantics of locations far from the patch. We call this new class of adversarial examples `remote adversarial patches' (RAP).   We implement our own RAP called IPatch and perform an in-depth analysis on image segmentation RAP attacks using five state-of-the-art architectures with eight different encoders on the CamVid street view dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the attack can be extended to object recognition models with preliminary results on the popular YOLOv3 model. We found that the patch can change the classification of a remote target region with a success rate of up to 93% on average.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']"
High-Resolution Segmentation of Tooth Root Fuzzy Edge Based on Polynomial Curve Fitting with Landmark Detection,"As the most economical and routine auxiliary examination in the diagnosis of root canal treatment, oral X-ray has been widely used by stomatologists. It is still challenging to segment the tooth root with a blurry boundary for the traditional image segmentation method. To this end, we propose a model for high-resolution segmentation based on polynomial curve fitting with landmark detection (HS-PCL). It is based on detecting multiple landmarks evenly distributed on the edge of the tooth root to fit a smooth polynomial curve as the segmentation of the tooth root, thereby solving the problem of fuzzy edge. In our model, a maximum number of the shortest distances algorithm (MNSDA) is proposed to automatically reduce the negative influence of the wrong landmarks which are detected incorrectly and deviate from the tooth root on the fitting result. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only reduces Hausdorff95 (HD95) by 33.9% and Average Surface Distance (ASD) by 42.1% compared with the state-of-the-art method, but it also achieves excellent results on the minute quantity of datasets, which greatly improves the feasibility of automatic root canal therapy evaluation by medical image computing.",['cs.CV']
Learning Fuzzy Clustering for SPECT/CT Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks,"Quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (QBSPECT) has the potential to provide a better quantitative assessment of bone metastasis than planar bone scintigraphy due to its ability to better quantify activity in overlapping structures. An important element of assessing response of bone metastasis is accurate image segmentation. However, limited by the properties of QBSPECT images, the segmentation of anatomical regions-of-interests (ROIs) still relies heavily on the manual delineation by experts. This work proposes a fast and robust automated segmentation method for partitioning a QBSPECT image into lesion, bone, and background. We present a new unsupervised segmentation loss function and its semi- and supervised variants for training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet). The loss functions were developed based on the objective function of the classical Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. We conducted a comprehensive study to compare our proposed methods with ConvNets trained using supervised loss functions and conventional clustering methods. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and several other metrics were used as figures of merit as applied to the task of delineating lesion and bone in both simulated and clinical SPECT/CT images. We experimentally demonstrated that the proposed methods yielded good segmentation results on a clinical dataset even though the training was done using realistic simulated images. A ConvNet-based image segmentation method that uses novel loss functions was developed and evaluated. The method can operate in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or fully-supervised modes depending on the availability of annotated training data. The results demonstrated that the proposed method provides fast and robust lesion and bone segmentation for QBSPECT/CT. The method can potentially be applied to other medical image segmentation applications.",['cs.CV']
Argmax Flows and Multinomial Diffusion: Learning Categorical Distributions,"Generative flows and diffusion models have been predominantly trained on ordinal data, for example natural images. This paper introduces two extensions of flows and diffusion for categorical data such as language or image segmentation: Argmax Flows and Multinomial Diffusion. Argmax Flows are defined by a composition of a continuous distribution (such as a normalizing flow), and an argmax function. To optimize this model, we learn a probabilistic inverse for the argmax that lifts the categorical data to a continuous space. Multinomial Diffusion gradually adds categorical noise in a diffusion process, for which the generative denoising process is learned. We demonstrate that our method outperforms existing dequantization approaches on text modelling and modelling on image segmentation maps in log-likelihood.","['stat.ML', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"
Learning Uncertainty For Safety-Oriented Semantic Segmentation In Autonomous Driving,"In this paper, we show how uncertainty estimation can be leveraged to enable safety critical image segmentation in autonomous driving, by triggering a fallback behavior if a target accuracy cannot be guaranteed. We introduce a new uncertainty measure based on disagreeing predictions as measured by a dissimilarity function. We propose to estimate this dissimilarity by training a deep neural architecture in parallel to the task-specific network. It allows this observer to be dedicated to the uncertainty estimation, and let the task-specific network make predictions. We propose to use self-supervision to train the observer, which implies that our method does not require additional training data. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is much less computationally intensive at inference time than competing methods (e.g. MCDropout), while delivering better results on safety-oriented evaluation metrics on the CamVid dataset, especially in the case of glare artifacts.",['cs.CV']
BoundarySqueeze: Image Segmentation as Boundary Squeezing,"We propose a novel method for fine-grained high-quality image segmentation of both objects and scenes. Inspired by dilation and erosion from morphological image processing techniques, we treat the pixel level segmentation problems as squeezing object boundary. From this perspective, we propose \textbf{Boundary Squeeze} module: a novel and efficient module that squeezes the object boundary from both inner and outer directions which leads to precise mask representation. To generate such squeezed representation, we propose a new bidirectionally flow-based warping process and design specific loss signals to supervise the learning process. Boundary Squeeze Module can be easily applied to both instance and semantic segmentation tasks as a plug-and-play module by building on top of existing models. We show that our simple yet effective design can lead to high qualitative results on several different datasets and we also provide several different metrics on boundary to prove the effectiveness over previous work. Moreover, the proposed module is light-weighted and thus has potential for practical usage. Our method yields large gains on COCO, Cityscapes, for both instance and semantic segmentation and outperforms previous state-of-the-art PointRend in both accuracy and speed under the same setting. Code and model will be available.",['cs.CV']

Deep Active Contours Using Locally Controlled Distance Vector Flow,"Active contours Model (ACM) has been extensively used in computer vision and image processing. In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been combined with active contours replacing the user in the process of contour evolution and image segmentation to eliminate limitations associated with ACM's dependence on parameters of the energy functional and initialization. However, prior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here. In addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to initial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully automatic image segmentation method to address problems of manual initialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries, in addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We train two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and generate a ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization circle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing from each pixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which is equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly available datasets including two building instance segmentation datasets, Vaihingen and Bing huts, and two mammography image datasets, INBreast and DDSM-BCRP. Our approach outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 7.38 and 8.62 percent in Boundary F-score (BoundF) for Vaihingen and Bing huts datasets, respectively. Dice similarity coefficient for the INBreast and DDSM-BCRP datasets is 94.23% and 90.89%, respectively indicating our method is comparable to state-of-the-art frameworks.",['cs.CV']
A Large-Scale Benchmark for Food Image Segmentation,"Food image segmentation is a critical and indispensible task for developing health-related applications such as estimating food calories and nutrients. Existing food image segmentation models are underperforming due to two reasons: (1) there is a lack of high quality food image datasets with fine-grained ingredient labels and pixel-wise location masks -- the existing datasets either carry coarse ingredient labels or are small in size; and (2) the complex appearance of food makes it difficult to localize and recognize ingredients in food images, e.g., the ingredients may overlap one another in the same image, and the identical ingredient may appear distinctly in different food images. In this work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension FoodSeg154) containing 9,490 images. We annotate these images with 154 ingredient classes and each image has an average of 6 ingredient labels and pixel-wise masks. In addition, we propose a multi-modality pre-training approach called ReLeM that explicitly equips a segmentation model with rich and semantic food knowledge. In experiments, we use three popular semantic segmentation methods (i.e., Dilated Convolution based, Feature Pyramid based, and Vision Transformer based) as baselines, and evaluate them as well as ReLeM on our new datasets. We believe that the FoodSeg103 (and its extension FoodSeg154) and the pre-trained models using ReLeM can serve as a benchmark to facilitate future works on fine-grained food image understanding. We make all these datasets and methods public at \url{https://xiongweiwu.github.io/foodseg103.html}.","['cs.CV', 'cs.MM']"
CASSOD-Net: Cascaded and Separable Structures of Dilated Convolution for Embedded Vision Systems and Applications,"The field of view (FOV) of convolutional neural networks is highly related to the accuracy of inference. Dilated convolutions are known as an effective solution to the problems which require large FOVs. However, for general-purpose hardware or dedicated hardware, it usually takes extra time to handle dilated convolutions compared with standard convolutions. In this paper, we propose a network module, Cascaded and Separable Structure of Dilated (CASSOD) Convolution, and a special hardware system to handle the CASSOD networks efficiently. A CASSOD-Net includes multiple cascaded $2 \times 2$ dilated filters, which can be used to replace the traditional $3 \times 3$ dilated filters without decreasing the accuracy of inference. Two example applications, face detection and image segmentation, are tested with dilated convolutions and the proposed CASSOD modules. The new network for face detection achieves higher accuracy than the previous work with only 47% of filter weights in the dilated convolution layers of the context module. Moreover, the proposed hardware system can accelerate the computations of dilated convolutions, and it is 2.78 times faster than traditional hardware systems when the filter size is $3 \times 3$.",['cs.CV']
Distributional Gaussian Process Layers for Outlier Detection in Image Segmentation,"We propose a parameter efficient Bayesian layer for hierarchical convolutional Gaussian Processes that incorporates Gaussian Processes operating in Wasserstein-2 space to reliably propagate uncertainty. This directly replaces convolving Gaussian Processes with a distance-preserving affine operator on distributions. Our experiments on brain tissue-segmentation show that the resulting architecture approaches the performance of well-established deterministic segmentation algorithms (U-Net), which has never been achieved with previous hierarchical Gaussian Processes. Moreover, by applying the same segmentation model to out-of-distribution data (i.e., images with pathology such as brain tumors), we show that our uncertainty estimates result in out-of-distribution detection that outperforms the capabilities of previous Bayesian networks and reconstruction-based approaches that learn normative distributions.","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']"
Rethinking BiSeNet For Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"BiSeNet has been proved to be a popular two-stream network for real-time segmentation. However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial information is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained tasks, e.g., image classification, may be inefficient for image segmentation due to the deficiency of task-specific design. To handle these problems, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Short-Term Dense Concatenate network (STDC network) by removing structure redundancy. Specifically, we gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them for image representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network. In the decoder, we propose a Detail Aggregation module by integrating the learning of spatial information into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deep features are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. On Cityscapes, we achieve 71.9% mIoU on the test set with a speed of 250.4 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, which is 45.2% faster than the latest methods, and achieve 76.8% mIoU with 97.0 FPS while inferring on higher resolution images.",['cs.CV']
Quantization of Deep Neural Networks for Accurate EdgeComputing,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their great potential in recent years, exceeding the per-formance of human experts in a wide range of applications. Due to their large sizes, however, compressiontechniques such as weight quantization and pruning are usually applied before they can be accommodated onthe edge. It is generally believed that quantization leads to performance degradation, and plenty of existingworks have explored quantization strategies aiming at minimum accuracy loss. In this paper, we argue thatquantization, which essentially imposes regularization on weight representations, can sometimes help toimprove accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three widely used applications: fully con-nected network (FCN) for biomedical image segmentation, convolutional neural network (CNN) for imageclassification on ImageNet, and recurrent neural network (RNN) for automatic speech recognition, and experi-mental results show that quantization can improve the accuracy by 1%, 1.95%, 4.23% on the three applicationsrespectively with 3.5x-6.4x memory reduction.",['cs.CV']
ObjectAug: Object-level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation aims to obtain object labels with precise boundaries, which usually suffers from overfitting. Recently, various data augmentation strategies like regional dropout and mix strategies have been proposed to address the problem. These strategies have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts. However, current strategies operate at the image level, and objects and the background are coupled. Thus, the boundaries are not well augmented due to the fixed semantic scenario. In this paper, we propose ObjectAug to perform object-level augmentation for semantic image segmentation. ObjectAug first decouples the image into individual objects and the background using the semantic labels. Next, each object is augmented individually with commonly used augmentation methods (e.g., scaling, shifting, and rotation). Then, the black area brought by object augmentation is further restored using image inpainting. Finally, the augmented objects and background are assembled as an augmented image. In this way, the boundaries can be fully explored in the various semantic scenarios. In addition, ObjectAug can support category-aware augmentation that gives various possibilities to objects in each category, and can be easily combined with existing image-level augmentation methods to further boost performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both natural image and medical image datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our ObjectAug can evidently improve segmentation performance.",['cs.CV']
Flow-based Video Segmentation for Human Head and Shoulders,"Video segmentation for the human head and shoulders is essential in creating elegant media for videoconferencing and virtual reality applications. The main challenge is to process high-quality background subtraction in a real-time manner and address the segmentation issues under motion blurs, e.g., shaking the head or waving hands during conference video. To overcome the motion blur problem in video segmentation, we propose a novel flow-based encoder-decoder network (FUNet) that combines both traditional Horn-Schunck optical-flow estimation technique and convolutional neural networks to perform robust real-time video segmentation. We also introduce a video and image segmentation dataset: ConferenceVideoSegmentationDataset. Code and pre-trained models are available on our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/kuangzijian/Flow-Based-Video-Matting}.",['cs.CV']
Spatially Varying Label Smoothing: Capturing Uncertainty from Expert Annotations,"The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities regarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We argue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no extra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can lead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the underlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is trained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown to be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking the local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions with low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the structural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends itself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are available. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical segmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and single and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS, despite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved uncertainty and model calibration.",['cs.CV']
Constrained domain adaptation for Image segmentation,"We propose to adapt segmentation networks with a constrained formulation, which embeds domain-invariant prior knowledge about the segmentation regions. Such knowledge may take the form of simple anatomical information, e.g., structure size or shape, estimated from source samples or known a priori. Our method imposes domain-invariant inequality constraints on the network outputs of unlabeled target samples. It implicitly matches prediction statistics between target and source domains with permitted uncertainty of prior knowledge. We address our constrained problem with a differentiable penalty, fully suited for standard stochastic gradient descent approaches, removing the need for computationally expensive Lagrangian optimization with dual projections. Unlike current two-step adversarial training, our formulation is based on a single loss in a single network, which simplifies adaptation by avoiding extra adversarial steps, while improving convergence and quality of training.   The comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art adversarial methods reveals substantially better performance on the challenging task of adapting spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our results also show a robustness to imprecision of size priors, approaching the accuracy of a fully supervised model trained directly in a target domain.Our method can be readily used for various constraints and segmentation problems.",['cs.CV']
Ensemble Learning based on Classifier Prediction Confidence and Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimisation for polyp localisation,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the first cause of death in many countries. CRC originates from a small clump of cells on the lining of the colon called polyps, which over time might grow and become malignant. Early detection and removal of polyps are therefore necessary for the prevention of colon cancer. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble of medical polyp segmentation algorithms. Based on an observation that different segmentation algorithms will perform well on different subsets of examples because of the nature and size of training sets they have been exposed to and because of method-intrinsic factors, we propose to measure the confidence in the prediction of each algorithm and then use an associate threshold to determine whether the confidence is acceptable or not. An algorithm is selected for the ensemble if the confidence is below its associate threshold. The optimal threshold for each segmentation algorithm is found by using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO), a swarm intelligence algorithm. The Dice coefficient, a popular performance metric for image segmentation, is used as the fitness criteria. Experimental results on two polyp segmentation datasets MICCAI2015 and Kvasir-SEG confirm that our ensemble achieves better results compared to some well-known segmentation algorithms.",['cs.CV']
Two layer Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation,"In recent years, deep learning has rapidly become a method of choice for the segmentation of medical images. Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures such as UNet have achieved state-of-the-art results on many medical datasets. To further improve the performance in the segmentation task, we develop an ensemble system which combines various deep learning architectures. We propose a two-layer ensemble of deep learning models for the segmentation of medical images. The prediction for each training image pixel made by each model in the first layer is used as the augmented data of the training image for the second layer of the ensemble. The prediction of the second layer is then combined by using a weights-based scheme in which each model contributes differently to the combined result. The weights are found by solving linear regression problems. Experiments conducted on two popular medical datasets namely CAMUS and Kvasir-SEG show that the proposed method achieves better results concerning two performance metrics (Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff distance) compared to some well-known benchmark algorithms.",['cs.CV']
Deep Tiered Image Segmentation For Detecting Internal Ice Layers in Radar Imagery,"Understanding the structure of Earth's polar ice sheets is important for modeling how global warming will impact polar ice and, in turn, the Earth's climate. Ground-penetrating radar is able to collect observations of the internal structure of snow and ice, but the process of manually labeling these observations is slow and laborious. Recent work has developed automatic techniques for finding the boundaries between the ice and the bedrock, but finding internal layers - the subtle boundaries that indicate where one year's ice accumulation ended and the next began - is much more challenging because the number of layers varies and the boundaries often merge and split. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for solving a general class of tiered segmentation problems. We then apply it to detecting internal layers in polar ice, evaluating on a large-scale dataset of polar ice radar data with human-labeled annotations as ground truth.",['cs.CV']
MeanShift++: Extremely Fast Mode-Seeking With Applications to Segmentation and Object Tracking,"MeanShift is a popular mode-seeking clustering algorithm used in a wide range of applications in machine learning. However, it is known to be prohibitively slow, with quadratic runtime per iteration. We propose MeanShift++, an extremely fast mode-seeking algorithm based on MeanShift that uses a grid-based approach to speed up the mean shift step, replacing the computationally expensive neighbors search with a density-weighted mean of adjacent grid cells. In addition, we show that this grid-based technique for density estimation comes with theoretical guarantees. The runtime is linear in the number of points and exponential in dimension, which makes MeanShift++ ideal on low-dimensional applications such as image segmentation and object tracking. We provide extensive experimental analysis showing that MeanShift++ can be more than 10,000x faster than MeanShift with competitive clustering results on benchmark datasets and nearly identical image segmentations as MeanShift. Finally, we show promising results for object tracking.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Polygonal Building Segmentation by Frame Field Learning,"While state of the art image segmentation models typically output segmentations in raster format, applications in geographic information systems often require vector polygons. To help bridge the gap between deep network output and the format used in downstream tasks, we add a frame field output to a deep segmentation model for extracting buildings from remote sensing images. We train a deep neural network that aligns a predicted frame field to ground truth contours. This additional objective improves segmentation quality by leveraging multi-task learning and provides structural information that later facilitates polygonization; we also introduce a polygonization algorithm that utilizes the frame field along with the raster segmentation.

Task-agnostic Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Kernel Density Estimation,"In the recent years, researchers proposed a number of successful methods to perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep neural networks (DNNs). So far the scope of the highly accurate methods has been limited to image level classification tasks. However, attempts for generally applicable methods beyond classification did not attain similar performance. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a simple yet effective task-agnostic OOD detection method. We estimate the probability density functions (pdfs) of intermediate features of a pre-trained DNN by performing kernel density estimation (KDE) on the training dataset. As direct application of KDE to feature maps is hindered by their high dimensionality, we use a set of lower-dimensional marginalized KDE models instead of a single high-dimensional one. At test time, we evaluate the pdfs on a test sample and produce a confidence score that indicates the sample is OOD. The use of KDE eliminates the need for making simplifying assumptions about the underlying feature pdfs and makes the proposed method task-agnostic. We perform extensive experiments on classification tasks using benchmark datasets for OOD detection. Additionally, we perform experiments on medical image segmentation tasks using brain MRI datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves high OOD detection performance in both classification and segmentation tasks and improves state-of-the-art in almost all cases.

Boundary IoU: Improving Object-Centric Image Segmentation Evaluation,"We present Boundary IoU (Intersection-over-Union), a new segmentation evaluation measure focused on boundary quality. We perform an extensive analysis across different error types and object sizes and show that Boundary IoU is significantly more sensitive than the standard Mask IoU measure to boundary errors for large objects and does not over-penalize errors on smaller objects. The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on Boundary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision) and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show that the new evaluation metrics track boundary quality improvements that are generally overlooked by current Mask IoU-based evaluation metrics. We hope that the adoption of the new boundary-sensitive evaluation metrics will lead to rapid progress in segmentation methods that improve boundary quality.",['cs.CV']
DCNAS: Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically designing scalable network architectures for dense image predictions. However, existing NAS algorithms usually compromise on restricted search space and search on proxy task to meet the achievable computational demands. To allow as wide as possible network architectures and avoid the gap between target and proxy dataset, we propose a Densely Connected NAS (DCNAS) framework, which directly searches the optimal network structures for the multi-scale representations of visual information, over a large-scale target dataset. Specifically, by connecting cells with each other using learnable weights, we introduce a densely connected search space to cover an abundance of mainstream network designs. Moreover, by combining both path-level and channel-level sampling strategies, we design a fusion module to reduce the memory consumption of ample search space. We demonstrate that the architecture obtained from our DCNAS algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performances on public semantic image segmentation benchmarks, including 84.3% on Cityscapes, and 86.9% on PASCAL VOC 2012. We also retain leading performances when evaluating the architecture on the more challenging ADE20K and Pascal Context dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Learning Versatile Neural Architectures by Propagating Network Codes,"This work explores how to design a single neural network that is capable of adapting to multiple heterogeneous tasks of computer vision, such as image segmentation, 3D detection, and video recognition. This goal is challenging because network architecture designs in different tasks are inconsistent. We solve this challenge by proposing Network Coding Propagation (NCP), a novel ""neural predictor"", which is able to predict an architecture's performance in multiple datasets and tasks. Unlike prior arts of neural architecture search (NAS) that typically focus on a single task, NCP has several unique benefits. (1) NCP can be trained on different NAS benchmarks, such as NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-MR, which contains a novel network space designed by us for jointly searching an architecture among multiple tasks, including ImageNet, Cityscapes, KITTI, and HMDB51. (2) NCP learns from network codes but not original data, enabling it to update the architecture efficiently across datasets. (3) Extensive experiments evaluate NCP on object classification, detection, segmentation, and video recognition. For example, with 17\% fewer FLOPs, a single architecture returned by NCP achieves 86\% and 77.16\% on ImageNet-50-1000 and Cityscapes respectively, outperforming its counterparts. More interestingly, NCP enables a single architecture applicable to both image segmentation and video recognition, which achieves competitive performance on both HMDB51 and ADE20K compared to the singular counterparts.

Improving Image co-segmentation via Deep Metric Learning,"Deep Metric Learning (DML) is helpful in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we firstly introduce DML into image co-segmentation. We propose a novel Triplet loss for Image Segmentation, called IS-Triplet loss for short, and combine it with traditional image segmentation loss. Different from the general DML task which learns the metric between pictures, we treat each pixel as a sample, and use their embedded features in high-dimensional space to form triples, then we tend to force the distance between pixels of different categories greater than of the same category by optimizing IS-Triplet loss so that the pixels from different categories are easier to be distinguished in the high-dimensional feature space. We further present an efficient triple sampling strategy to make a feasible computation of IS-Triplet loss. Finally, the IS-Triplet loss is combined with 3 traditional image segmentation losses to perform image segmentation. We apply the proposed approach to image co-segmentation and test it on the SBCoseg dataset and the Internet dataset. The experimental result shows that our approach can effectively improve the discrimination of pixels' categories in high-dimensional space and thus help traditional loss achieve better performance of image segmentation with fewer training epochs.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Topology-Aware Segmentation Using Discrete Morse Theory,"In the segmentation of fine-scale structures from natural and biomedical images, per-pixel accuracy is not the only metric of concern. Topological correctness, such as vessel connectivity and membrane closure, is crucial for downstream analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a new approach to train deep image segmentation networks for better topological accuracy. In particular, leveraging the power of discrete Morse theory (DMT), we identify global structures, including 1D skeletons and 2D patches, which are important for topological accuracy. Trained with a novel loss based on these global structures, the network performance is significantly improved especially near topologically challenging locations (such as weak spots of connections and membranes). On diverse datasets, our method achieves superior performance on both the DICE score and topological metrics.",['cs.CV']
Semi-Supervised Learning for Eye Image Segmentation,"Recent advances in appearance-based models have shown improved eye tracking performance in difficult scenarios like occlusion due to eyelashes, eyelids or camera placement, and environmental reflections on the cornea and glasses. The key reason for the improvement is the accurate and robust identification of eye parts (pupil, iris, and sclera regions). The improved accuracy often comes at the cost of labeling an enormous dataset, which is complex and time-consuming. This work presents two semi-supervised learning frameworks to identify eye-parts by taking advantage of unlabeled images where labeled datasets are scarce. With these frameworks, leveraging the domain-specific augmentation and novel spatially varying transformations for image segmentation, we show improved performance on various test cases. For instance, for a model trained on just 48 labeled images, these frameworks achieved an improvement of 0.38% and 0.65% in segmentation performance over the baseline model, which is trained only with the labeled dataset.",['cs.CV']
PointFlow: Flowing Semantics Through Points for Aerial Image Segmentation,"Aerial Image Segmentation is a particular semantic segmentation problem and has several challenging characteristics that general semantic segmentation does not have. There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely foreground-background imbalanced distribution, and the other is multiple small objects along with the complex background. Such problems make the recent dense affinity context modeling perform poorly even compared with baselines due to over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency. In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object boundaries, respectively. Experimental results on three different aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on three aerial benchmarks. Further experiments on three general semantic segmentation datasets prove the generality of our method. Code will be provided in (https: //github.com/lxtGH/PFSegNets).",['cs.CV']
Deep Superpixel Cut for Unsupervised Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation, one of the most critical vision tasks, has been studied for many years. Most of the early algorithms are unsupervised methods, which use hand-crafted features to divide the image into many regions. Recently, owing to the great success of deep learning technology, CNNs based methods show superior performance in image segmentation. However, these methods rely on a large number of human annotations, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a deep unsupervised method for image segmentation, which contains the following two stages. First, a Superpixelwise Autoencoder (SuperAE) is designed to learn the deep embedding and reconstruct a smoothed image, then the smoothed image is passed to generate superpixels. Second, we present a novel clustering algorithm called Deep Superpixel Cut (DSC), which measures the deep similarity between superpixels and formulates image segmentation as a soft partitioning problem. Via backpropagation, DSC adaptively partitions the superpixels into perceptual regions. Experimental results on the BSDS500 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",['cs.CV']
The Weakly-Labeled Rand Index,"Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) surveys produce imagery with large regions of transition between seabed types. Due to these regions, it is difficult to label and segment the imagery and, furthermore, challenging to score the image segmentations appropriately. While there are many approaches to quantify performance in standard crisp segmentation schemes, drawing hard boundaries in remote sensing imagery where gradients and regions of uncertainty exist is inappropriate. These cases warrant weak labels and an associated appropriate scoring approach. In this paper, a labeling approach and associated modified version of the Rand index for weakly-labeled data is introduced to address these issues. Results are evaluated with the new index and compared to traditional segmentation evaluation methods. Experimental results on a SAS data set containing must-link and cannot-link labels show that our Weakly-Labeled Rand index scores segmentations appropriately in reference to qualitative performance and is more suitable than traditional quantitative metrics for scoring weakly-labeled data.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
CoTr: Efficiently Bridging CNN and Transformer for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de facto standard for nowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used in these networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range dependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although Transformer was born to address this issue, it suffers from extreme computational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature maps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a {\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\bf Tr}ansformer {\bf (CoTr)} for accurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is constructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the extracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all image positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key positions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the computational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced, making it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps, which are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation. We conduct an extensive evaluation on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV) dataset that covers 11 major human organs. The results indicate that our CoTr leads to a substantial performance improvement over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods on the 3D multi-organ segmentation task.

K-means Segmentation Based-on Lab Color Space for Embryo Egg Detection,"The hatching process also influences the success of hatching eggs beside the initial egg factor. So that the results have a large percentage of hatching, it is necessary to check the development of the embryo at the beginning of the hatching. This process aims to sort eggs that have embryos to remain hatched until the end. Maximum checking is done the first week in the hatching period. This study aims to detect the presence of embryos in eggs. Detection of the existence of embryos is processed using segmentation. Egg images are segmented using the K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the images acquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of Lab color space images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means process uses cluster k=3, where this cluster divided the image into three parts, namely background, eggs, and yolk eggs. Yolk eggs are part of eggs that have embryonic characteristics. This study applies the concept of color in the initial segmentation and grayscale in the final stages. The results of the initial phase show that the image segmentation results using k-means clustering based on Lab color space provide a grouping of three parts. At the grayscale image processing stage, the results of color image segmentation are processed with grayscaling, image enhancement, and morphology. Thus, it seems clear that the yolk segmented shows the presence of egg embryos. Based on this process and results, K-means segmentation based on Lab color space can be used for the initial stages of the embryo detection process. The evaluation uses MSE and MSSIM, with values of 0.0486 and 0.9979; this can be used as a reference that the results obtained can indicate the detection of embryos in egg yolk.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Generative Synthetic Augmentation using Label-to-Image Translation for Nuclei Image Segmentation,"In medical image diagnosis, pathology image analysis using semantic segmentation becomes important for efficient screening as a field of digital pathology. The spatial augmentation is ordinary used for semantic segmentation. Tumor images under malignant are rare and to annotate the labels of nuclei region takes much time-consuming. We require an effective use of dataset to maximize the segmentation accuracy. It is expected that some augmentation to transform generalized images influence the segmentation performance. We propose a synthetic augmentation using label-to-image translation, mapping from a semantic label with the edge structure to a real image. Exactly this paper deal with stain slides of nuclei in tumor. Actually, we demonstrate several segmentation algorithms applied to the initial dataset that contains real images and labels using synthetic augmentation in order to add their generalized images. We computes and reports that a proposed synthetic augmentation procedure improve their accuracy.","['cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
MixSearch: Searching for Domain Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Architectures,"Considering the scarcity of medical data, most datasets in medical image analysis are an order of magnitude smaller than those of natural images. However, most Network Architecture Search (NAS) approaches in medical images focused on specific datasets and did not take into account the generalization ability of the learned architectures on unseen datasets as well as different domains. In this paper, we address this point by proposing to search for generalizable U-shape architectures on a composited dataset that mixes medical images from multiple segmentation tasks and domains creatively, which is named MixSearch. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to mix multiple small-scale datasets from multiple domains and segmentation tasks to produce a large-scale dataset. Then, a novel weaved encoder-decoder structure is designed to search for a generalized segmentation network in both cell-level and network-level. The network produced by the proposed MixSearch framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared with advanced encoder-decoder networks across various datasets.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Uncertainty-based method for improving poorly labeled segmentation datasets,"The success of modern deep learning algorithms for image segmentation heavily depends on the availability of large datasets with clean pixel-level annotations (masks), where the objects of interest are accurately delineated. Lack of time and expertise during data annotation leads to incorrect boundaries and label noise. It is known that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can memorize even completely random labels, resulting in poor accuracy. We propose a framework to train binary segmentation DCNNs using sets of unreliable pixel-level annotations. Erroneously labeled pixels are identified based on the estimated aleatoric uncertainty of the segmentation and are relabeled to the true value.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Saliency-Aware Class-Agnostic Food Image Segmentation,"Advances in image-based dietary assessment methods have allowed nutrition professionals and researchers to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment, where images of food consumed are captured using smartphones or wearable devices. These images are then analyzed using computer vision methods to estimate energy and nutrition content of the foods. Food image segmentation, which determines the regions in an image where foods are located, plays an important role in this process. Current methods are data dependent, thus cannot generalize well for different food types. To address this problem, we propose a class-agnostic food image segmentation method. Our method uses a pair of eating scene images, one before start eating and one after eating is completed. Using information from both the before and after eating images, we can segment food images by finding the salient missing objects without any prior information about the food class. We model a paradigm of top down saliency which guides the attention of the human visual system (HVS) based on a task to find the salient missing objects in a pair of images. Our method is validated on food images collected from a dietary study which showed promising results.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
L-SNet: from Region Localization to Scale Invariant Medical Image Segmentation,"Coarse-to-fine models and cascade segmentation architectures are widely adopted to solve the problem of large scale variations in medical image segmentation. However, those methods have two primary limitations: the first-stage segmentation becomes a performance bottleneck; the lack of overall differentiability makes the training process of two stages asynchronous and inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a differentiable two-stage network architecture to tackle these problems. In the first stage, a localization network (L-Net) locates Regions of Interest (RoIs) in a detection fashion; in the second stage, a segmentation network (S-Net) performs fine segmentation on the recalibrated RoIs; a RoI recalibration module between L-Net and S-Net eliminating the inconsistencies. Experimental results on the public dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art coarse-to-fine models with negligible computation overheads.",['cs.CV']
Self-paced and self-consistent co-training for semi-supervised image segmentation,"Deep co-training has recently been proposed as an effective approach for image segmentation when annotated data is scarce. In this paper, we improve existing approaches for semi-supervised segmentation with a self-paced and self-consistent co-training method. To help distillate information from unlabeled images, we first design a self-paced learning strategy for co-training that lets jointly-trained neural networks focus on easier-to-segment regions first, and then gradually consider harder ones.This is achieved via an end-to-end differentiable loss inthe form of a generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence(JSD). Moreover, to encourage predictions from different networks to be both consistent and confident, we enhance this generalized JSD loss with an uncertainty regularizer based on entropy. The robustness of individual models is further improved using a self-ensembling loss that enforces their prediction to be consistent across different training iterations. We demonstrate the potential of our method on three challenging image segmentation problems with different image modalities, using small fraction of labeled data. Results show clear advantages in terms of performance compared to the standard co-training baselines and recently proposed state-of-the-art approaches for semi-supervised segmentation",['cs.CV']
Mask-based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a crucial component in image analysis. Training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation requires a large amount of labeled data, where the production of such labeled data is both costly and labor intensive. Semi-supervised learning algorithms address this issue by utilizing unlabeled data and so reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training. In particular, data augmentation techniques such as CutMix and ClassMix generate additional training data from existing labeled data. In this paper we propose a new approach for data augmentation, termed ComplexMix, which incorporates aspects of CutMix and ClassMix with improved performance. The proposed approach has the ability to control the complexity of the augmented data while attempting to be semantically-correct and address the tradeoff between complexity and correctness. The proposed ComplexMix approach is evaluated on a standard dataset for semantic segmentation and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our method yields improvement over state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets for semantic image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Network-Agnostic Knowledge Transfer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Conventional transfer learning leverages weights of pre-trained networks, but mandates the need for similar neural architectures. Alternatively, knowledge distillation can transfer knowledge between heterogeneous networks but often requires access to the original training data or additional generative networks. Knowledge transfer between networks can be improved by being agnostic to the choice of network architecture and reducing the dependence on original training data. We propose a knowledge transfer approach from a teacher to a student network wherein we train the student on an independent transferal dataset, whose annotations are generated by the teacher. Experiments were conducted on five state-of-the-art networks for semantic segmentation and seven datasets across three imaging modalities. We studied knowledge transfer from a single teacher, combination of knowledge transfer and fine-tuning, and knowledge transfer from multiple teachers. The student model with a single teacher achieved similar performance as the teacher; and the student model with multiple teachers achieved better performance than the teachers. The salient features of our algorithm include: 1)no need for original training data or generative networks, 2) knowledge transfer between different architectures, 3) ease of implementation for downstream tasks by using the downstream task dataset as the transferal dataset, 4) knowledge transfer of an ensemble of models, trained independently, into one student model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for knowledge transfer and easily tunable.",['cs.CV']
DSAL: Deeply Supervised Active Learning from Strong and Weak Labelers for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation is one of the most essential biomedical image processing problems for different imaging modalities, including microscopy and X-ray in the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) domain. However, annotating biomedical images is knowledge-driven, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of active learning methods generally still require huge computational costs and utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high uncertainties and low uncertainties for strong labelers and weak labelers respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'eess.IV']"
Personal Fixations-Based Object Segmentation with Object Localization and Boundary Preservation,"As a natural way for human-computer interaction, fixation provides a promising solution for interactive image segmentation. In this paper, we focus on Personal Fixations-based Object Segmentation (PFOS) to address issues in previous studies, such as the lack of appropriate dataset and the ambiguity in fixations-based interaction. In particular, we first construct a new PFOS dataset by carefully collecting pixel-level binary annotation data over an existing fixation prediction dataset, such dataset is expected to greatly facilitate the study along the line. Then, considering characteristics of personal fixations, we propose a novel network based on Object Localization and Boundary Preservation (OLBP) to segment the gazed objects. Specifically, the OLBP network utilizes an Object Localization Module (OLM) to analyze personal fixations and locates the gazed objects based on the interpretation. Then, a Boundary Preservation Module (BPM) is designed to introduce additional boundary information to guard the completeness of the gazed objects. Moreover, OLBP is organized in the mixed bottom-up and top-down manner with multiple types of deep supervision. Extensive experiments on the constructed PFOS dataset show the superiority of the proposed OLBP network over 17 state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OLM and BPM components. The constructed PFOS dataset and the proposed OLBP network are available at https://github.com/MathLee/OLBPNet4PFOS.",['cs.CV']
U-Noise: Learnable Noise Masks for Interpretable Image Segmentation,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for decision making in a myriad of critical applications, ranging from medical to societal and even judicial. Given the importance of these decisions, it is crucial for us to be able to interpret these models. We introduce a new method for interpreting image segmentation models by learning regions of images in which noise can be applied without hindering downstream model performance. We apply this method to segmentation of the pancreas in CT scans, and qualitatively compare the quality of the method to existing explainability techniques, such as Grad-CAM and occlusion sensitivity. Additionally we show that, unlike other methods, our interpretability model can be quantitatively evaluated based on the downstream performance over obscured images.",['cs.CV']
Diminishing Uncertainty within the Training Pool: Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,"Active learning is a unique abstraction of machine learning techniques where the model/algorithm could guide users for annotation of a set of data points that would be beneficial to the model, unlike passive machine learning. The primary advantage being that active learning frameworks select data points that can accelerate the learning process of a model and can reduce the amount of data needed to achieve full accuracy as compared to a model trained on a randomly acquired data set. Multiple frameworks for active learning combined with deep learning have been proposed, and the majority of them are dedicated to classification tasks. Herein, we explore active learning for the task of segmentation of medical imaging data sets. We investigate our proposed framework using two datasets: 1.) MRI scans of the hippocampus, 2.) CT scans of pancreas and tumors. This work presents a query-by-committee approach for active learning where a joint optimizer is used for the committee. At the same time, we propose three new strategies for active learning: 1.) increasing frequency of uncertain data to bias the training data set; 2.) Using mutual information among the input images as a regularizer for acquisition to ensure diversity in the training dataset; 3.) adaptation of Dice log-likelihood for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). The results indicate an improvement in terms of data reduction by achieving full accuracy while only using 22.69 % and 48.85 % of the available data for each dataset, respectively.",['cs.CV']
Deep Class-Specific Affinity-Guided Convolutional Network for Multimodal Unpaired Image Segmentation,"Multi-modal medical image segmentation plays an essential role in clinical diagnosis. It remains challenging as the input modalities are often not well-aligned spatially. Existing learning-based methods mainly consider sharing trainable layers across modalities and minimizing visual feature discrepancies. While the problem is often formulated as joint supervised feature learning, multiple-scale features and class-specific representation have not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose an affinity-guided fully convolutional network for multimodal image segmentation. To learn effective representations, we design class-specific affinity matrices to encode the knowledge of hierarchical feature reasoning, together with the shared convolutional layers to ensure the cross-modality generalization. Our affinity matrix does not depend on spatial alignments of the visual features and thus allows us to train with unpaired, multimodal inputs. We extensively evaluated our method on two public multimodal benchmark datasets and outperform state-of-the-art methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Power-SLIC: Diagram-based superpixel generation,"Superpixel algorithms, which group pixels similar in color and other low-level properties, are increasingly used for pre-processing in image segmentation. Commonly important criteria for the computation of superpixels are boundary adherence, speed, and regularity.   Boundary adherence and regularity are typically contradictory goals. Most recent algorithms have focused on improving boundary adherence. Motivated by improving superpixel regularity, we propose a diagram-based superpixel generation method called Power-SLIC.   On the BSDS500 data set, Power-SLIC outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of compactness and boundary precision, and its boundary adherence is the most robust against varying levels of Gaussian noise. In terms of speed, Power-SLIC is competitive with SLIC.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"

In this paper, we focus on cloud cover nowcasting, which has various application areas such as satellite shots optimisation and photovoltaic energy production forecast.   Following recent deep learning successes on multiple imagery tasks, we applied deep convolutionnal neural networks on Meteosat satellite images for cloud cover nowcasting.

Computer Stereo Vision for Autonomous Driving,"As an important component of autonomous systems, autonomous car perception has had a big leap with recent advances in parallel computing architectures. With the use of tiny but full-feature embedded supercomputers, computer stereo vision has been prevalently applied in autonomous cars for depth perception. The two key aspects of computer stereo vision are speed and accuracy. They are both desirable but conflicting properties, as the algorithms with better disparity accuracy usually have higher computational complexity. Therefore, the main aim of developing a computer stereo vision algorithm for resource-limited hardware is to improve the trade-off between speed and accuracy. In this chapter, we introduce both the hardware and software aspects of computer stereo vision for autonomous car systems. Then, we discuss four autonomous car perception tasks, including 1) visual feature detection, description and matching, 2) 3D information acquisition, 3) object detection/recognition and 4) semantic image segmentation. The principles of computer stereo vision and parallel computing on multi-threading CPU and GPU architectures are then detailed.",['cs.CV']
Unlabeled Data Guided Semi-supervised Histopathology Image Segmentation,"Automatic histopathology image segmentation is crucial to disease analysis. Limited available labeled data hinders the generalizability of trained models under the fully supervised setting. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on generative methods has been proven to be effective in utilizing diverse image characteristics. However, it has not been well explored what kinds of generated images would be more useful for model training and how to use such images. In this paper, we propose a new data guided generative method for histopathology image segmentation by leveraging the unlabeled data distributions. First, we design an image generation module. Image content and style are disentangled and embedded in a clustering-friendly space to utilize their distributions. New images are synthesized by sampling and cross-combining contents and styles. Second, we devise an effective data selection policy for judiciously sampling the generated images: (1) to make the generated training set better cover the dataset, the clusters that are underrepresented in the original training set are covered more; (2) to make the training process more effective, we identify and oversample the images of ""hard cases"" in the data for which annotated training data may be scarce. Our method is evaluated on glands and nuclei datasets. We show that under both the inductive and transductive settings, our SSL method consistently boosts the performance of common segmentation models and attains state-of-the-art results.",['cs.CV']
Unsupervised Image Segmentation using Mutual Mean-Teaching,"Unsupervised image segmentation aims at assigning the pixels with similar feature into a same cluster without annotation, which is an important task in computer vision. Due to lack of prior knowledge, most of existing model usually need to be trained several times to obtain suitable results. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised image segmentation model based on the Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT) framework to produce more stable results. In addition, since the labels of pixels from two model are not matched, a label alignment algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm is proposed to match the cluster labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to segment various types of images and achieves better performance than the existing methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
mDALU: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation and Label Unification with Partial Datasets,"Object recognition advances very rapidly these days. One challenge is to generalize existing methods to new domains, to more classes and/or to new data modalities. In order to avoid annotating one dataset for each of these new cases, one needs to combine and reuse existing datasets that may belong to different domains, have partial annotations, and/or have different data modalities. This paper treats this task as a multi-source domain adaptation and label unification (mDALU) problem and proposes a novel method for it. Our method consists of a partially-supervised adaptation stage and a fully-supervised adaptation stage. In the former, partial knowledge is transferred from multiple source domains to the target domain and fused therein. Negative transfer between unmatched label space is mitigated via three new modules: domain attention, uncertainty maximization and attention-guided adversarial alignment. In the latter, knowledge is transferred in the unified label space after a label completion process with pseudo-labels. We verify the method on three different tasks, image classification, 2D semantic image segmentation, and joint 2D-3D semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms all competing methods significantly.",['cs.CV']
"Artist, Style And Year Classification Using Face Recognition And Clustering With Convolutional Neural Networks","Artist, year and style classification of fine-art paintings are generally achieved using standard image classification methods, image segmentation, or more recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This works aims to use newly developed face recognition methods such as FaceNet that use CNNs to cluster fine-art paintings using the extracted faces in the paintings, which are found abundantly. A dataset consisting of over 80,000 paintings from over 1000 artists is chosen, and three separate face recognition and clustering tasks are performed. The produced clusters are analyzed by the file names of the paintings and the clusters are named by their majority artist, year range, and style. The clusters are further analyzed and their performance metrics are calculated. The study shows promising results as the artist, year, and styles are clustered with an accuracy of 58.8, 63.7, and 81.3 percent, while the clusters have an average purity of 63.1, 72.4, and 85.9 percent.",['cs.CV']
Towards Robust Medical Image Segmentation on Small-Scale Data with Incomplete Labels,"The data-driven nature of deep learning models for semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-level annotations. However, large-scale and fully labeled medical datasets are often unavailable for practical tasks. Recently, partially supervised methods have been proposed to utilize images with incomplete labels to mitigate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. As an emerging research area, the breakthroughs made by existing methods rely on either large-scale data or complex model design, which makes them 1) less practical for certain real-life tasks and 2) less robust for small-scale data. It is time to step back and think about the robustness of partially supervised methods and how to maximally utilize small-scale and partially labeled data for medical image segmentation tasks. To bridge the methodological gaps in label-efficient deep learning with partial supervision, we propose RAMP, a simple yet efficient data augmentation framework for partially supervised medical image segmentation by exploiting the assumption that patients share anatomical similarities. We systematically evaluate RAMP and the previous methods in various controlled multi-structure segmentation tasks. Compared to the mainstream approaches, RAMP consistently improves the performance of traditional segmentation networks on small-scale partially labeled data and utilize additional image-wise weak annotations.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
High-level Prior-based Loss Functions for Medical Image Segmentation: A Survey,"Today, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state of the art performance for supervised medical image segmentation, across various imaging modalities and tasks. Despite early success, segmentation networks may still generate anatomically aberrant segmentations, with holes or inaccuracies near the object boundaries. To mitigate this effect, recent research works have focused on incorporating spatial information or prior knowledge to enforce anatomically plausible segmentation. If the integration of prior knowledge in image segmentation is not a new topic in classical optimization approaches, it is today an increasing trend in CNN based image segmentation, as shown by the growing literature on the topic. In this survey, we focus on high level prior, embedded at the loss function level. We categorize the articles according to the nature of the prior: the object shape, size, topology, and the inter-regions constraints. We highlight strengths and limitations of current approaches, discuss the challenge related to the design and the integration of prior-based losses, and the optimization strategies, and draw future research directions.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Segmentation overlapping wear particles with few labelled data and imbalance sample,"Ferrograph image segmentation is of significance for obtaining features of wear particles. However, wear particles are usually overlapped in the form of debris chains, which makes challenges to segment wear debris. An overlapping wear particle segmentation network (OWPSNet) is proposed in this study to segment the overlapped debris chains. The proposed deep learning model includes three parts: a region segmentation network, an edge detection network and a feature refine module. The region segmentation network is an improved U shape network, and it is applied to separate the wear debris form background of ferrograph image. The edge detection network is used to detect the edges of wear particles. Then, the feature refine module combines low-level features and high-level semantic features to obtain the final results. In order to solve the problem of sample imbalance, we proposed a square dice loss function to optimize the model. Finally, extensive experiments have been carried out on a ferrograph image dataset. Results show that the proposed model is capable of separating overlapping wear particles. Moreover, the proposed square dice loss function can improve the segmentation results, especially for the segmentation results of wear particle edge.",['cs.CV']
DoDNet: Learning to segment multi-organ and tumors from multiple partially labeled datasets,"Due to the intensive cost of labor and expertise in annotating 3D medical images at a voxel level, most benchmark datasets are equipped with the annotations of only one type of organs and/or tumors, resulting in the so-called partially labeling issue. To address this, we propose a dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on partially labeled datasets. DoDNet consists of a shared encoder-decoder architecture, a task encoding module, a controller for generating dynamic convolution filters, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The information of the current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior to tell the model what the task is expected to solve. Different from existing approaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are generated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and assigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as done by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and flexible manner. We have created a large-scale partially labeled dataset, termed MOTS, and demonstrated the superior performance of our DoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. We also transferred the weights pre-trained on MOTS to a downstream multi-organ segmentation task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This study provides a general 3D medical image segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large-scale partially labelled dataset and can be extended (after fine-tuning) to downstream volumetric medical data segmentation tasks.

Enforcing Perceptual Consistency on Generative Adversarial Networks by Using the Normalised Laplacian Pyramid Distance,"In recent years there has been a growing interest in image generation through deep learning. While an important part of the evaluation of the generated images usually involves visual inspection, the inclusion of human perception as a factor in the training process is often overlooked. In this paper we propose an alternative perceptual regulariser for image-to-image translation using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). To do so automatically (avoiding visual inspection), we use the Normalised Laplacian Pyramid Distance (NLPD) to measure the perceptual similarity between the generated image and the original image. The NLPD is based on the principle of normalising the value of coefficients with respect to a local estimate of mean energy at different scales and has already been successfully tested in different experiments involving human perception. We compare this regulariser with the originally proposed L1 distance and note that when using NLPD the generated images contain more realistic values for both local and global contrast. We found that using NLPD as a regulariser improves image segmentation accuracy on generated images as well as improving two no-reference image quality metrics.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
ROAM: Random Layer Mixup for Semi-Supervised Learning in Medical Imaging,"Medical image segmentation is one of the major challenges addressed by machine learning methods. Yet, deep learning methods profoundly depend on a large amount of annotated data, which is time-consuming and costly. Though, semi-supervised learning methods approach this problem by leveraging an abundant amount of unlabeled data along with a small amount of labeled data in the training process. Recently, MixUp regularizer has been successfully introduced to semi-supervised learning methods showing superior performance. MixUp augments the model with new data points through linear interpolation of the data at the input space. We argue that this option is limited. Instead, we propose ROAM, a RandOm lAyer Mixup, which encourages the network to be less confident for interpolated data points at randomly selected space. ROAM generates more data points that have never seen before, and hence it avoids over-fitting and enhances the generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our method on three publicly available datasets on whole-brain image segmentation. ROAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in fully supervised (89.5%) and semi-supervised (87.0%) settings with a relative improvement of up to 2.40% and 16.50%, respectively for the whole-brain segmentation.",['cs.CV']
w-Net: Dual Supervised Medical Image Segmentation Model with Multi-Dimensional Attention and Cascade Multi-Scale Convolution,"Deep learning-based medical image segmentation technology aims at automatic recognizing and annotating objects on the medical image. Non-local attention and feature learning by multi-scale methods are widely used to model network, which drives progress in medical image segmentation. However, those attention mechanism methods have weakly non-local receptive fields' strengthened connection for small objects in medical images. Then, the features of important small objects in abstract or coarse feature maps may be deserted, which leads to unsatisfactory performance. Moreover, the existing multi-scale methods only simply focus on different sizes of view, whose sparse multi-scale features collected are not abundant enough for small objects segmentation. In this work, a multi-dimensional attention segmentation model with cascade multi-scale convolution is proposed to predict accurate segmentation for small objects in medical images. As the weight function, multi-dimensional attention modules provide coefficient modification for significant/informative small objects features. Furthermore, The cascade multi-scale convolution modules in each skip-connection path are exploited to capture multi-scale features in different semantic depth. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets: KiTS19, Pancreas CT of Decathlon-10, and MICCAI 2018 LiTS Challenge, demonstrating better segmentation performances than the state-of-the-art baselines.",['cs.CV']
Interpretable and synergistic deep learning for visual explanation and statistical estimations of segmentation of disease features from medical images,"Deep learning (DL) models for disease classification or segmentation from medical images are increasingly trained using transfer learning (TL) from unrelated natural world images. However, shortcomings and utility of TL for specialized tasks in the medical imaging domain remain unknown and are based on assumptions that increasing training data will improve performance. We report detailed comparisons, rigorous statistical analysis and comparisons of widely used DL architecture for binary segmentation after TL with ImageNet initialization (TII-models) with supervised learning with only medical images(LMI-models) of macroscopic optical skin cancer, microscopic prostate core biopsy and Computed Tomography (CT) DICOM images. Through visual inspection of TII and LMI model outputs and their Grad-CAM counterparts, our results identify several counter intuitive scenarios where automated segmentation of one tumor by both models or the use of individual segmentation output masks in various combinations from individual models leads to 10% increase in performance. We also report sophisticated ensemble DL strategies for achieving clinical grade medical image segmentation and model explanations under low data regimes. For example; estimating performance, explanations and replicability of LMI and TII models described by us can be used for situations in which sparsity promotes better learning. A free GitHub repository of TII and LMI models, code and more than 10,000 medical images and their Grad-CAM output from this study can be used as starting points for advanced computational medicine and DL research for biomedical discovery and applications.","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']"
Global Image Segmentation Process using Machine Learning algorithm & Convolution Neural Network method for Self- Driving Vehicles,"In autonomous Vehicles technology Image segmentation was a major problem in visual perception. This image segmentation process is mainly used in medical applications. Here we adopted an image segmentation process to visual perception tasks for predicting the agents on the surrounding environment, identifying the road boundaries and tracking the line markings. Main objective of the paper is to divide the input images using the image segmentation process and Convolution Neural Network method for efficient results of visual perception.

Recyclable Waste Identification Using CNN Image Recognition and Gaussian Clustering,"Waste recycling is an important way of saving energy and materials in the production process. In general cases recyclable objects are mixed with unrecyclable objects, which raises a need for identification and classification. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to complete both tasks. The model uses transfer learning from a pretrained Resnet-50 CNN to complete feature extraction. A subsequent fully connected layer for classification was trained on the augmented TrashNet dataset [1]. In the application, sliding-window is used for image segmentation in the pre-classification stage. In the post-classification stage, the labelled sample points are integrated with Gaussian Clustering to locate the object. The resulting model has achieved an overall detection rate of 48.4% in simulation and final classification accuracy of 92.4%.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
Context-based Image Segment Labeling (CBISL),"Working with images, one often faces problems with incomplete or unclear information. Image inpainting can be used to restore missing image regions but focuses, however, on low-level image features such as pixel intensity, pixel gradient orientation, and color. This paper aims to recover semantic image features (objects and positions) in images. Based on published gated PixelCNNs, we demonstrate a new approach referred to as quadro-directional PixelCNN to recover missing objects and return probable positions for objects based on the context. We call this approach context-based image segment labeling (CBISL). The results suggest that our four-directional model outperforms one-directional models (gated PixelCNN) and returns a human-comparable performance.",['cs.CV']
Highway Driving Dataset for Semantic Video Segmentation,"Scene understanding is an essential technique in semantic segmentation. Although there exist several datasets that can be used for semantic segmentation, they are mainly focused on semantic image segmentation with large deep neural networks. Therefore, these networks are not useful for real time applications, especially in autonomous driving systems. In order to solve this problem, we make two contributions to semantic segmentation task. The first contribution is that we introduce the semantic video dataset, the Highway Driving dataset, which is a densely annotated benchmark for a semantic video segmentation task. The Highway Driving dataset consists of 20 video sequences having a 30Hz frame rate, and every frame is densely annotated. Secondly, we propose a baseline algorithm that utilizes a temporal correlation. Together with our attempt to analyze the temporal correlation, we expect the Highway Driving dataset to encourage research on semantic video segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Contrastive learning of global and local features for medical image segmentation with limited annotations,"A key requirement for the success of supervised deep learning is a large labeled dataset - a condition that is difficult to meet in medical image analysis. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can help in this regard by providing a strategy to pre-train a neural network with unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning for a downstream task with limited annotations. Contrastive learning, a particular variant of SSL, is a powerful technique for learning image-level representations. In this work, we propose strategies for extending the contrastive learning framework for segmentation of volumetric medical images in the semi-supervised setting with limited annotations, by leveraging domain-specific and problem-specific cues. Specifically, we propose (1) novel contrasting strategies that leverage structural similarity across volumetric medical images (domain-specific cue) and (2) a local version of the contrastive loss to learn distinctive representations of local regions that are useful for per-pixel segmentation (problem-specific cue). We carry out an extensive evaluation on three Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets. In the limited annotation setting, the proposed method yields substantial improvements compared to other self-supervision and semi-supervised learning techniques. When combined with a simple data augmentation technique, the proposed method reaches within 8% of benchmark performance using only two labeled MRI volumes for training, corresponding to only 4% (for ACDC) of the training data used to train the benchmark. The code is made public at https://github.com/krishnabits001/domain_specific_cl.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Disentangling Human Error from the Ground Truth in Segmentation of Medical Images,"Recent years have seen increasing use of supervised learning methods for segmentation tasks. However, the predictive performance of these algorithms depends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the medical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human experts provide their estimates of the ""true"" segmentation labels under the influence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy labels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic segmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for jointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of individual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the estimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity with the noisy training data. We first define a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST and study the properties of the proposed algorithm. We then demonstrate the utility of the method on three public medical imaging segmentation datasets with simulated (when necessary) and real diverse annotations: 1) MSLSC (multiple-sclerosis lesions); 2) BraTS (brain tumours); 3) LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities). In all cases, our method outperforms competing methods and relevant baselines particularly in cases where the number of annotations is small and the amount of disagreement is large. The experiments also show strong ability to capture the complex spatial characteristics of annotators' mistakes.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
A Teacher-Student Framework for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation From Mixed Supervision,"Standard segmentation of medical images based on full-supervised convolutional networks demands accurate dense annotations. Such learning framework is built on laborious manual annotation with restrict demands for expertise, leading to insufficient high-quality labels. To overcome such limitation and exploit massive weakly labeled data, we relaxed the rigid labeling requirement and developed a semi-supervised learning framework based on a teacher-student fashion for organ and lesion segmentation with partial dense-labeled supervision and supplementary loose bounding-box supervision which are easier to acquire. Observing the geometrical relation of an organ and its inner lesions in most cases, we propose a hierarchical organ-to-lesion (O2L) attention module in a teacher segmentor to produce pseudo-labels. Then a student segmentor is trained with combinations of manual-labeled and pseudo-labeled annotations. We further proposed a localization branch realized via an aggregation of high-level features in a deep decoder to predict locations of organ and lesion, which enriches student segmentor with precise localization information. We validated each design in our model on LiTS challenge datasets by ablation study and showed its state-of-the-art performance compared with recent methods. We show our model is robust to the quality of bounding box and achieves comparable performance compared with full-supervised learning methods.",['cs.CV']
Gastric histopathology image segmentation using a hierarchical conditional random field,"For the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied in the intelligent diagnosis of gastric cancer, existing methods mostly focus on individual characteristics or network frameworks without a policy to depict the integral information. Mainly, Conditional Random Field (CRF), an efficient and stable algorithm for analyzing images containing complicated contents, can characterize spatial relation in images. In this paper, a novel Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) based Gastric Histopathology Image Segmentation (GHIS) method is proposed, which can automatically localize abnormal (cancer) regions in gastric histopathology images obtained by an optical microscope to assist histopathologists in medical work. This HCRF model is built up with higher order potentials, including pixel-level and patch-level potentials, and graph-based post-processing is applied to further improve its segmentation performance. Especially, a CNN is trained to build up the pixel-level potentials and another three CNNs are fine-tuned to build up the patch-level potentials for sufficient spatial segmentation information. In the experiment, a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained gastric histopathological dataset with 560 abnormal images are divided into training, validation and test sets with a ratio of 1 : 1 : 2. Finally, segmentation accuracy, recall and specificity of 78.91%, 65.59%, and 81.33% are achieved on the test set. Our HCRF model demonstrates high segmentation performance and shows its effectiveness and future potential in the GHIS field.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
HS-ResNet: Hierarchical-Split Block on Convolutional Neural Network,"This paper addresses representational block named Hierarchical-Split Block, which can be taken as a plug-and-play block to upgrade existing convolutional neural networks, improves model performance significantly in a network. Hierarchical-Split Block contains many hierarchical split and concatenate connections within one single residual block. We find multi-scale features is of great importance for numerous vision tasks. Moreover, Hierarchical-Split block is very flexible and efficient, which provides a large space of potential network architectures for different applications. In this work, we present a common backbone based on Hierarchical-Split block for tasks: image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic image segmentation/parsing. Our approach shows significant improvements over all these core tasks in comparison with the baseline. As shown in Figure1, for image classification, our 50-layers network(HS-ResNet50) achieves 81.28% top-1 accuracy with competitive latency on ImageNet-1k dataset. It also outperforms most state-of-the-art models. The source code and models will be available on: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas",['cs.CV']
PP-LinkNet: Improving Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Satellite Imagery with Multi-stage Training,"Road network and building footprint extraction is essential for many applications such as updating maps, traffic regulations, city planning, ride-hailing, disaster response \textit{etc}. Mapping road networks is currently both expensive and labor-intensive. Recently, improvements in image segmentation through the application of deep neural networks has shown promising results in extracting road segments from large scale, high resolution satellite imagery. However, significant challenges remain due to lack of enough labeled training data needed to build models for industry grade applications. In this paper, we propose a two-stage transfer learning technique to improve robustness of semantic segmentation for satellite images that leverages noisy pseudo ground truth masks obtained automatically (without human labor) from crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. We further propose Pyramid Pooling-LinkNet (PP-LinkNet), an improved deep neural network for segmentation that uses focal loss, poly learning rate, and context module. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through evaluations done on three popular datasets over two tasks, namely, road extraction and building foot-print detection. Specifically, we obtain 78.19\% meanIoU on SpaceNet building footprint dataset, 67.03\% and 77.11\% on the road topology metric on SpaceNet and DeepGlobe road extraction dataset, respectively.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Self-Supervision with Superpixels: Training Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation without Annotation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) has great potential for medical imaging applications. Most of the existing FSS techniques require abundant annotated semantic classes for training. However, these methods may not be applicable for medical images due to the lack of annotations. To address this problem we make several contributions: (1) A novel self-supervised FSS framework for medical images in order to eliminate the requirement for annotations during training. Additionally, superpixel-based pseudo-labels are generated to provide supervision; (2) An adaptive local prototype pooling module plugged into prototypical networks, to solve the common challenging foreground-background imbalance problem in medical image segmentation; (3) We demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed approach for medical images using three different tasks: abdominal organ segmentation for CT and MRI, as well as cardiac segmentation for MRI. Our results show that, for medical image segmentation, the proposed method outperforms conventional FSS methods which require manual annotations for training.",['cs.CV']
Depth-wise layering of 3d images using dense depth maps: a threshold based approach,"Image segmentation has long been a basic problem in computer vision. Depth-wise Layering is a kind of segmentation that slices an image in a depth-wise sequence unlike the conventional image segmentation problems dealing with surface-wise decomposition. The proposed Depth-wise Layering technique uses a single depth image of a static scene to slice it into multiple layers. The technique employs a thresholding approach to segment rows of the dense depth map into smaller partitions called Line-Segments in this paper. Then, it uses the line-segment labelling method to identify number of objects and layers of the scene independently. The final stage is to link objects of the scene to their respective object-layers. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique by applying that on many images along with their dense depth maps. The experiments have shown promising results of layering.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Realistic Image Normalization for Multi-Domain Segmentation,"Image normalization is a building block in medical image analysis. Conventional approaches are customarily utilized on a per-dataset basis. This strategy, however, prevents the current normalization algorithms from fully exploiting the complex joint information available across multiple datasets. Consequently, ignoring such joint information has a direct impact on the performance of segmentation algorithms. This paper proposes to revisit the conventional image normalization approach by instead learning a common normalizing function across multiple datasets. Jointly normalizing multiple datasets is shown to yield consistent normalized images as well as an improved image segmentation. To do so, a fully automated adversarial and task-driven normalization approach is employed as it facilitates the training of realistic and interpretable images while keeping performance on-par with the state-of-the-art. The adversarial training of our network aims at finding the optimal transfer function to improve both the segmentation accuracy and the generation of realistic images. We evaluated the performance of our normalizer on both infant and adult brains images from the iSEG, MRBrainS and ABIDE datasets. Results reveal the potential of our normalization approach for segmentation, with Dice improvements of up to 57.5% over our baseline. Our method can also enhance data availability by increasing the number of samples available when learning from multiple imaging domains.","['cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Deep Learning for Earth Image Segmentation based on Imperfect Polyline Labels with Annotation Errors,"In recent years, deep learning techniques (e.g., U-Net, DeepLab) have achieved tremendous success in image segmentation. The performance of these models heavily relies on high-quality ground truth segment labels. Unfortunately, in many real-world problems, ground truth segment labels often have geometric annotation errors due to manual annotation mistakes, GPS errors, or visually interpreting background imagery at a coarse resolution. Such location errors will significantly impact the training performance of existing deep learning algorithms. Existing research on label errors either models ground truth errors in label semantics (assuming label locations to be correct) or models label location errors with simple square patch shifting. These methods cannot fully incorporate the geometric properties of label location errors. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a generic learning framework based on the EM algorithm to update deep learning model parameters and infer hidden true label locations simultaneously. Evaluations on a real-world hydrological dataset in the streamline refinement application show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy (reducing the number of false positives by 67% and reducing the number of false negatives by 55%).","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
RefVOS: A Closer Look at Referring Expressions for Video Object Segmentation,"The task of video object segmentation with referring expressions (language-guided VOS) is to, given a linguistic phrase and a video, generate binary masks for the object to which the phrase refers. Our work argues that existing benchmarks used for this task are mainly composed of trivial cases, in which referents can be identified with simple phrases. Our analysis relies on a new categorization of the phrases in the DAVIS-2017 and Actor-Action datasets into trivial and non-trivial REs, with the non-trivial REs annotated with seven RE semantic categories. We leverage this data to analyze the results of RefVOS, a novel neural network that obtains competitive results for the task of language-guided image segmentation and state of the art results for language-guided VOS. Our study indicates that the major challenges for the task are related to understanding motion and static actions.",['cs.CV']
Content-based Propagation of User Markings for Interactive Segmentation of Patterned Images,"Efficient and easy segmentation of images and volumes is of great practical importance. Segmentation problems that motivate our approach originate from microscopy imaging commonly used in materials science, medicine, and biology. We formulate image segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification problem, and we apply segmentation as a step towards characterising image content. Our method allows the user to define structures of interest by interactively marking a subset of pixels. Thanks to the real-time feedback, the user can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome. The final pixel classification may be obtained from a very modest user input. An important ingredient of our method is a graph that encodes image content. This graph is built in an unsupervised manner during initialisation and is based on clustering of image features. Since we combine a limited amount of user-labelled data with the clustering information obtained from the unlabelled parts of the image, our method fits in the general framework of semi-supervised learning. We demonstrate how this can be a very efficient approach to segmentation through pixel classification.",['cs.CV']
A Survey on Deep Learning Methods for Semantic Image Segmentation in Real-Time,"Semantic image segmentation is one of fastest growing areas in computer vision with a variety of applications.

Interactive Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Earth Observation,"Dense pixel-wise classification maps output by deep neural networks are of extreme importance for scene understanding. However, these maps are often partially inaccurate due to a variety of possible factors. Therefore, we propose to interactively refine them within a framework named DISCA (Deep Image Segmentation with Continual Adaptation). It consists of continually adapting a neural network to a target image using an interactive learning process with sparse user annotations as ground-truth. We show through experiments on three datasets using synthesized annotations the benefits of the approach, reaching an IoU improvement up to 4.7% for ten sampled clicks. Finally, we exhibit that our approach can be particularly rewarding when it is faced to additional issues such as domain adaptation.",['cs.CV']
Segmentations-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Semantic Image Segmentation,"Today's success of state of the art methods for semantic segmentation is driven by large datasets. Data is considered an important asset that needs to be protected, as the collection and annotation of such datasets comes at significant efforts and associated costs. In addition, visual data might contain private or sensitive information, that makes it equally unsuited for public release. Unfortunately, recent work on membership inference in the broader area of adversarial machine learning and inference attacks on machine learning models has shown that even black box classifiers leak information on the dataset that they were trained on. We show that such membership inference attacks can be successfully carried out on complex, state of the art models for semantic segmentation. In order to mitigate the associated risks, we also study a series of defenses against such membership inference attacks and find effective counter measures against the existing risks with little effect on the utility of the segmentation method. Finally, we extensively evaluate our attacks and defenses on a range of relevant real-world datasets: Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas.",['cs.CV']
UXNet: Searching Multi-level Feature Aggregation for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Aggregating multi-level feature representation plays a critical role in achieving robust volumetric medical image segmentation, which is important for the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment. Unlike the recent neural architecture search (NAS) methods that typically searched the optimal operators in each network layer, but missed a good strategy to search for feature aggregations, this paper proposes a novel NAS method for 3D medical image segmentation, named UXNet, which searches both the scale-wise feature aggregation strategies as well as the block-wise operators in the encoder-decoder network. UXNet has several appealing benefits. (1) It significantly improves flexibility of the classical UNet architecture, which only aggregates feature representations of encoder and decoder in equivalent resolution. (2) A continuous relaxation of UXNet is carefully designed, enabling its searching scheme performed in an efficient differentiable manner. (3) Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UXNet compared with recent NAS methods for medical image segmentation. The architecture discovered by UXNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of Dice on several public 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, especially for the boundary locations and tiny tissues. The searching computational complexity of UXNet is cheap, enabling to search a network with the best performance less than 1.5 days on two TitanXP GPUs.",['cs.CV']
LAMP: Large Deep Nets with Automated Model Parallelism for Image Segmentation,"Deep Learning (DL) models are becoming larger, because the increase in model size might offer significant accuracy gain. To enable the training of large deep networks, data parallelism and model parallelism are two well-known approaches for parallel training. However, data parallelism does not help reduce memory footprint per device. In this work, we introduce Large deep 3D ConvNets with Automated Model Parallelism (LAMP) and investigate the impact of both input's and deep 3D ConvNets' size on segmentation accuracy. Through automated model parallelism, it is feasible to train large deep 3D ConvNets with a large input patch, even the whole image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, facilitated by the automated model parallelism, the segmentation accuracy can be improved through increasing model size and input context size, and large input yields significant inference speedup compared with sliding window of small patches in the inference.

Deep Neural Network for 3D Surface Segmentation based on Contour Tree Hierarchy,"Given a 3D surface defined by an elevation function on a 2D grid as well as non-spatial features observed at each pixel, the problem of surface segmentation aims to classify pixels into contiguous classes based on both non-spatial features and surface topology. The problem has important applications in hydrology, planetary science, and biochemistry but is uniquely challenging for several reasons. First, the spatial extent of class segments follows surface contours in the topological space, regardless of their spatial shapes and directions. Second, the topological structure exists in multiple spatial scales based on different surface resolutions. Existing widely successful deep learning models for image segmentation are often not applicable due to their reliance on convolution and pooling operations to learn regular structural patterns on a grid. In contrast, we propose to represent surface topological structure by a contour tree skeleton, which is a polytree capturing the evolution of surface contours at different elevation levels. We further design a graph neural network based on the contour tree hierarchy to model surface topological structure at different spatial scales. Experimental evaluations based on real-world hydrological datasets show that our model outperforms several baseline methods in classification accuracy.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
TapLab: A Fast Framework for Semantic Video Segmentation Tapping into Compressed-Domain Knowledge,"Real-time semantic video segmentation is a challenging task due to the strict requirements of inference speed. Recent approaches mainly devote great efforts to reducing the model size for high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink this problem from a different viewpoint: using knowledge contained in compressed videos. We propose a simple and effective framework, dubbed TapLab, to tap into resources from the compressed domain. Specifically, we design a fast feature warping module using motion vectors for acceleration. To reduce the noise introduced by motion vectors, we design a residual-guided correction module and a residual-guided frame selection module using residuals. TapLab significantly reduces redundant computations of the state-of-the-art fast semantic image segmentation models, running 3 to 10 times faster with controllable accuracy degradation. The experimental results show that TapLab achieves 70.6% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset at 99.8 FPS with a single GPU card for the 1024x2048 videos. A high-speed version even reaches the speed of 160+ FPS. Codes will be available soon at https://github.com/Sixkplus/TapLab.",['cs.CV']
Sparse Coding Driven Deep Decision Tree Ensembles for Nuclear Segmentation in Digital Pathology Images,"In this paper, we propose an easily trained yet powerful representation learning approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks in a digital pathology image segmentation task. The method, called sparse coding driven deep decision tree ensembles that we abbreviate as ScD2TE, provides a new perspective on representation learning. We explore the possibility of stacking several layers based on non-differentiable pairwise modules and generate a densely concatenated architecture holding the characteristics of feature map reuse and end-to-end dense learning. Under this architecture, fast convolutional sparse coding is used to extract multi-level features from the output of each layer. In this way, rich image appearance models together with more contextual information are integrated by learning a series of decision tree ensembles. The appearance and the high-level context features of all the previous layers are seamlessly combined by concatenating them to feed-forward as input, which in turn makes the outputs of subsequent layers more accurate and the whole model efficient to train. Compared with deep neural networks, our proposed ScD2TE does not require back-propagation computation and depends on less hyper-parameters. ScD2TE is able to achieve a fast end-to-end pixel-wise training in a layer-wise manner. We demonstrated the superiority of our segmentation technique by evaluating it on the multi-disease state and multi-organ dataset where consistently higher performances were obtained for comparison against several state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), fully convolutional networks (FCN), etc.",['cs.CV']
Domain Adaptive Medical Image Segmentation via Adversarial Learning of Disease-Specific Spatial Patterns,"In medical imaging, the heterogeneity of multi-centre data impedes the applicability of deep learning-based methods and results in significant performance degradation when applying models in an unseen data domain, e.g. a new centreor a new scanner. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for boosting image segmentation performance across multiple domains without using any manual annotations from the new target domains, but by re-calibrating the networks on few images from the target domain. To achieve this, we enforce architectures to be adaptive to new data by rejecting improbable segmentation patterns and implicitly learning through semantic and boundary information, thus to capture disease-specific spatial patterns in an adversarial optimization. The adaptation process needs continuous monitoring, however, as we cannot assume the presence of ground-truth masks for the target domain, we propose two new metrics to monitor the adaptation process, and strategies to train the segmentation algorithm in a stable fashion. We build upon well-established 2D and 3D architectures and perform extensive experiments on three cross-centre brain lesion segmentation tasks, involving multicentre public and in-house datasets. We demonstrate that recalibrating the deep networks on a few unlabeled images from the target domain improves the segmentation accuracy significantly.",['cs.CV']
State-of-The-Art Fuzzy Active Contour Models for Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation is the initial step for every image analysis task. A large variety of segmentation algorithm has been proposed in the literature during several decades with some mixed success. Among them, the fuzzy energy based active contour models get attention to the researchers during last decade which results in development of various methods. A good segmentation algorithm should perform well in a large number of images containing noise, blur, low contrast, region in-homogeneity, etc. However, the performances of the most of the existing fuzzy energy based active contour models have been evaluated typically on the limited number of images. In this article, our aim is to review the existing fuzzy active contour models from the theoretical point of view and also evaluate them experimentally on a large set of images under the various conditions. The analysis under a large variety of images provides objective insight into the strengths and weaknesses of various fuzzy active contour models.

Heatmap-based Vanishing Point boosts Lane Detection,"Vision-based lane detection (LD) is a key part of autonomous driving technology, and it is also a challenging problem. As one of the important constraints of scene composition, vanishing point (VP) may provide a useful clue for lane detection. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-task fusion network architecture for high-precision lane detection. Firstly, the ERFNet was used as the backbone to extract the hierarchical features of the road image. Then, the lanes were detected using image segmentation. Finally, combining the output of lane detection and the hierarchical features extracted by the backbone, the lane VP was predicted using heatmap regression. The proposed fusion strategy was tested using the public CULane dataset. The experimental results suggest that the lane detection accuracy of our method outperforms those of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",['cs.CV']
Greenhouse Segmentation on High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery using Deep Learning Techniques,"Greenhouse segmentation has pivotal importance for climate-smart agricultural land-use planning. Deep learning-based approaches provide state-of-the-art performance in natural image segmentation.

In particular, customized variations of U-Net-like architectures are employed to identify greenhouses. Two models are proposed which uniquely incorporate dilated convolutions and skip connections, and the results are compared to that of the baseline U-Net model. The dataset used consists of pan-sharpened orthorectified Azersky images (red, green, blue,and near infrared channels) with 1.5-meter resolution and annotation masks, collected from 15 regions in Azerbaijan where the greenhouses are densely congested. The images cover the cumulative area of 1008 $km^2$ and annotation masks contain 47559 polygons in total. The $F_1, Kappa, AUC$, and $IOU$ scores are used for performance evaluation. It is observed that the use of the deconvolutional layers alone throughout the expansive path does not yield satisfactory results; therefore, they are either replaced or coupled with bilinear interpolation. All models benefit from the hard example mining (HEM) strategy. It is also reported that the best accuracy of $93.29\%$ ($F_1\,score$) is recorded when the weighted binary cross-entropy loss is coupled with the dice loss. Experimental results showed that both of the proposed models outperformed the baseline U-Net architecture such that the best model proposed scored $4.48\%$ higher in comparison to the baseline architecture.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
AinnoSeg: Panoramic Segmentation with High Perfomance,"Panoramic segmentation is a scene where image segmentation tasks is more difficult. With the development of CNN networks, panoramic segmentation tasks have been sufficiently developed.However, the current panoramic segmentation algorithms are more concerned with context semantics, but the details of image are not processed enough. Moreover, they cannot solve the problems which contains the accuracy of occluded object segmentation,little object segmentation,boundary pixel in object segmentation etc. Aiming to address these issues, this paper presents some useful tricks. (a) By changing the basic segmentation model, the model can take into account the large objects and the boundary pixel classification of image details. (b) Modify the loss function so that it can take into account the boundary pixels of multiple objects in the image. (c) Use a semi-supervised approach to regain control of the training process. (d) Using multi-scale training and reasoning. All these operations named AinnoSeg, AinnoSeg can achieve state-of-art performance on the well-known dataset ADE20K.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Automatic Image Labelling at Pixel Level,"The performance of deep networks for semantic image segmentation largely depends on the availability of large-scale training images which are labelled at the pixel level. Typically, such pixel-level image labellings are obtained manually by a labour-intensive process. To alleviate the burden of manual image labelling, we propose an interesting learning approach to generate pixel-level image labellings automatically. A Guided Filter Network (GFN) is first developed to learn the segmentation knowledge from a source domain, and such GFN then transfers such segmentation knowledge to generate coarse object masks in the target domain. Such coarse object masks are treated as pseudo labels and they are further integrated to optimize/refine the GFN iteratively in the target domain. Our experiments on six image sets have demonstrated that our proposed approach can generate fine-grained object masks (i.e., pixel-level object labellings), whose quality is very comparable to the manually-labelled ones. Our proposed approach can also achieve better performance on semantic image segmentation than most existing weakly-supervised approaches.",['cs.CV']
Beyond Single Stage Encoder-Decoder Networks: Deep Decoders for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Single encoder-decoder methodologies for semantic segmentation are reaching their peak in terms of segmentation quality and efficiency per number of layers. To address these limitations, we propose a new architecture based on a decoder which uses a set of shallow networks for capturing more information content. The new decoder has a new topology of skip connections, namely backward and stacked residual connections. In order to further improve the architecture we introduce a weight function which aims to re-balance classes to increase the attention of the networks to under-represented objects. We carried out an extensive set of experiments that yielded state-of-the-art results for the CamVid, Gatech and Freiburg Forest datasets. Moreover, to further prove the effectiveness of our decoder, we conducted a set of experiments studying the impact of our decoder to state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Additionally, we present a set of experiments augmenting semantic segmentation with optical flow information, showing that motion clues can boost pure image based semantic segmentation approaches.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
Superpixel-Guided Label Softening for Medical Image Segmentation,"Segmentation of objects of interest is one of the central tasks in medical image analysis, which is indispensable for quantitative analysis. When developing machine-learning based methods for automated segmentation, manual annotations are usually used as the ground truth toward which the models learn to mimic. While the bulky parts of the segmentation targets are relatively easy to label, the peripheral areas are often difficult to handle due to ambiguous boundaries and the partial volume effect, etc., and are likely to be labeled with uncertainty. This uncertainty in labeling may, in turn, result in unsatisfactory performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose superpixel-based label softening to tackle the above issue. Generated by unsupervised over-segmentation, each superpixel is expected to represent a locally homogeneous area. If a superpixel intersects with the annotation boundary, we consider a high probability of uncertain labeling within this area. Driven by this intuition, we soften labels in this area based on signed distances to the annotation boundary and assign probability values within [0, 1] to them, in comparison with the original ""hard"", binary labels of either 0 or 1. The softened labels are then used to train the segmentation models together with the hard labels. Experimental results on a brain MRI dataset and an optical coherence tomography dataset demonstrate that this conceptually simple and implementation-wise easy method achieves overall superior segmentation performances to baseline and comparison methods for both 3D and 2D medical images.",['cs.CV']
BUNET: Blind Medical Image Segmentation Based on Secure UNET,"The strict security requirements placed on medical records by various privacy regulations become major obstacles in the age of big data. To ensure efficient machine learning as a service schemes while protecting data confidentiality, in this work, we propose blind UNET (BUNET), a secure protocol that implements privacy-preserving medical image segmentation based on the UNET architecture. In BUNET, we efficiently utilize cryptographic primitives such as homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits (GC) to design a complete secure protocol for the UNET neural architecture. In addition, we perform extensive architectural search in reducing the computational bottleneck of GC-based secure activation protocols with high-dimensional input data. In the experiment, we thoroughly examine the parameter space of our protocol, and show that we can achieve up to 14x inference time reduction compared to the-state-of-the-art secure inference technique on a baseline architecture with negligible accuracy degradation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CR']"
On uncertainty estimation in active learning for image segmentation,"Uncertainty estimation is important for interpreting the trustworthiness of machine learning models in many applications. This is especially critical in the data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain accuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its estimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more informative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore uncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image segmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty estimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are investigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full images leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally show that annotating regions can cut 50% of pixels that need to be labeled by humans compared to annotating full images.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Superpixel Segmentation using Dynamic and Iterative Spanning Forest,"As constituent parts of image objects, superpixels can improve several higher-level operations. However, image segmentation methods might have their accuracy seriously compromised for reduced numbers of superpixels. We have investigated a solution based on the Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF) framework. In this work, we present Dynamic ISF (DISF) -- a method based on the following steps. (a) It starts from an image graph and a seed set with considerably more pixels than the desired number of superpixels. (b) The seeds compete among themselves, and each seed conquers its most closely connected pixels, resulting in an image partition (spanning forest) with connected superpixels. In step (c), DISF assigns relevance values to seeds based on superpixel analysis and removes the most irrelevant ones. Steps (b) and (c) are repeated until the desired number of superpixels is reached. DISF has the chance to reconstruct relevant edges after each iteration, when compared to region merging algorithms. As compared to other seed-based superpixel methods, DISF is more likely to find relevant seeds. It also introduces dynamic arc-weight estimation in the ISF framework for more effective superpixel delineation, and we demonstrate all results on three datasets with distinct object properties.",['cs.CV']
Medical Image Segmentation via Unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network,"For the majority of the learning-based segmentation methods, a large quantity of high-quality training data is required. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based segmentation model that could be trained semi- or un- supervised. Specifically, in the unsupervised setting, we parameterize the Active contour without edges (ACWE) framework via a convolutional neural network (ConvNet), and optimize the parameters of the ConvNet using a self-supervised method. In another setting (semi-supervised), the auxiliary segmentation ground truth is used during training. We show that the method provides fast and high-quality bone segmentation in the context of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Complex Network Construction for Interactive Image Segmentation using Particle Competition and Cooperation: A New Approach,"In the interactive image segmentation task, the Particle Competition and Cooperation (PCC) model is fed with a complex network, which is built from the input image. In the network construction phase, a weight vector is needed to define the importance of each element in the feature set, which consists of color and location information of the corresponding pixels, thus demanding a specialist's intervention. The present paper proposes the elimination of the weight vector through modifications in the network construction phase. The proposed model and the reference model, without the use of a weight vector, were compared using 151 images extracted from the Grabcut dataset, the PASCAL VOC dataset and the Alpha matting dataset. Each model was applied 30 times to each image to obtain an error average. These simulations resulted in an error rate of only 0.49\% when classifying pixels with the proposed model while the reference model had an error rate of 3.14\%. The proposed method also presented less error variation in the diversity of the evaluated images, when compared to the reference model.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Suggestive Annotation of Brain Tumour Images with Gradient-guided Sampling,"Machine learning has been widely adopted for medical image analysis in recent years given its promising performance in image segmentation and classification tasks. As a data-driven science, the success of machine learning, in particular supervised learning, largely depends on the availability of manually annotated datasets. For medical imaging applications, such annotated datasets are not easy to acquire. It takes a substantial amount of time and resource to curate an annotated medical image set. In this paper, we propose an efficient annotation framework for brain tumour images that is able to suggest informative sample images for human experts to annotate. Our experiments show that training a segmentation model with only 19% suggestively annotated patient scans from BraTS 2019 dataset can achieve a comparable performance to training a model on the full dataset for whole tumour segmentation task. It demonstrates a promising way to save manual annotation cost and improve data efficiency in medical imaging applications.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Kullback-Leibler Divergence-Based Fuzzy $C$-Means Clustering Incorporating Morphological Reconstruction and Wavelet Frames for Image Segmentation,"Although spatial information of images usually enhance the robustness of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, it greatly increases the computational costs for image segmentation. To achieve a sound trade-off between the segmentation performance and the speed of clustering, we come up with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based FCM algorithm by incorporating a tight wavelet frame transform and a morphological reconstruction operation. To enhance FCM's robustness, an observed image is first filtered by using the morphological reconstruction. A tight wavelet frame system is employed to decompose the observed and filtered images so as to form their feature sets. Considering these feature sets as data of clustering, an modified FCM algorithm is proposed, which introduces a KL divergence term in the partition matrix into its objective function. The KL divergence term aims to make membership degrees of each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, which brings that the membership partition becomes more suitable and the parameter setting of FCM becomes simplified. On the basis of the obtained partition matrix and prototypes, the segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the inverse process of the modified objective function. To modify abnormal features produced in the reconstruction process, each reconstructed feature is reassigned to the closest prototype. As a result, the segmentation accuracy of KL divergence-based FCM is further improved. What's more, the segmented image is reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Finally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical and color images are reported. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works well and comes with better segmentation performance than other comparative algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires less time than most of the FCM-related algorithms.",['cs.CV']
Automated Pavement Crack Segmentation Using U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network,"Automated pavement crack image segmentation is challenging because of inherent irregular patterns, lighting conditions, and noise in images. Conventional approaches require a substantial amount of feature engineering to differentiate crack regions from non-affected regions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique based on a convolutional neural network to perform segmentation tasks on pavement crack images. Our approach requires minimal feature engineering compared to other machine learning techniques. We propose a U-Net-based network architecture in which we replace the encoder with a pretrained ResNet-34 neural network. We use a ""one-cycle"" training schedule based on cyclical learning rates to speed up the convergence. Our method achieves an F1 score of 96% on the CFD dataset and 73% on the Crack500 dataset, outperforming other algorithms tested on these datasets. We perform ablation studies on various techniques that helped us get marginal performance boosts, i.e., the addition of spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (SCSE) modules, training with gradually increasing image sizes, and training various neural network layers with different learning rates.",['cs.CV']
Uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training for semi-supervised medical image segmentation and domain adaptation,"Although having achieved great success in medical image segmentation, deep learning-based approaches usually require large amounts of well-annotated data, which can be extremely expensive in the field of medical image analysis. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire. Semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation both take the advantage of unlabeled data, and they are closely related to each other. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), a unified framework that addresses these two tasks for volumetric medical image segmentation. Our framework is capable of efficiently utilizing unlabeled data for better performance. We firstly rotate and permute the 3D volumes into multiple views and train a 3D deep network on each view. We then apply co-training by enforcing multi-view consistency on unlabeled data, where an uncertainty estimation of each view is utilized to achieve accurate labeling. Experiments on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset and a multi-organ segmentation dataset show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework on semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we validate the effectiveness of this work by adapting our multi-organ segmentation model to two pathological organs from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Datasets. Additionally, we show that our UMCT-DA model can even effectively handle the challenging situation where labeled source data is inaccessible, demonstrating strong potentials for real-world applications.",['cs.CV']
Region-of-interest guided Supervoxel Inpainting for Self-supervision,"Self-supervised learning has proven to be invaluable in making best use of all of the available data in biomedical image segmentation. One particularly simple and effective mechanism to achieve self-supervision is inpainting, the task of predicting arbitrary missing areas based on the rest of an image. In this work, we focus on image inpainting as the self-supervised proxy task, and propose two novel structural changes to further enhance the performance of a deep neural network. We guide the process of generating images to inpaint by using supervoxel-based masking instead of random masking, and also by focusing on the area to be segmented in the primary task, which we term as the region-of-interest. We postulate that these additions force the network to learn semantics that are more attuned to the primary task, and test our hypotheses on two applications: brain tumour and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. We empirically show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms both supervised CNNs, without any self-supervision, and conventional inpainting-based self-supervision methods on both large and small training set sizes.",['cs.CV']
Post-DAE: Anatomically Plausible Segmentation via Post-Processing with Denoising Autoencoders,"We introduce Post-DAE, a post-processing method based on denoising autoencoders (DAE) to improve the anatomical plausibility of arbitrary biomedical image segmentation algorithms. Some of the most popular segmentation methods (e.g. based on convolutional neural networks or random forest classifiers) incorporate additional post-processing steps to ensure that the resulting masks fulfill expected connectivity constraints. These methods operate under the hypothesis that contiguous pixels with similar aspect should belong to the same class. Even if valid in general, this assumption does not consider more complex priors like topological restrictions or convexity, which cannot be easily incorporated into these methods. Post-DAE leverages the latest developments in manifold learning via denoising autoencoders. First, we learn a compact and non-linear embedding that represents the space of anatomically plausible segmentations. Then, given a segmentation mask obtained with an arbitrary method, we reconstruct its anatomically plausible version by projecting it onto the learnt manifold. The proposed method is trained using unpaired segmentation mask, what makes it independent of intensity information and image modality. We performed experiments in binary and multi-label segmentation of chest X-ray and cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show how erroneous and noisy segmentation masks can be improved using Post-DAE. With almost no additional computation cost, our method brings erroneous segmentations back to a feasible space.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Large-scale detection and categorization of oil spills from SAR images with deep learning,"We propose a deep learning framework to detect and categorize oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images at a large scale.

We also introduce a classification task, which is novel in the context of oil spill detection in SAR. Specifically, after being detected, each oil spill is also classified according to different categories pertaining to its shape and texture characteristics. The classification results provide valuable insights for improving the design of oil spill services by world-leading providers. As the last contribution, we present our operational pipeline and a visualization tool for large-scale data, which allows to detect and analyze the historical presence of oil spills worldwide.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Road surface detection and differentiation considering surface damages,"A challenge still to be overcome in the field of visual perception for vehicle and robotic navigation on heavily damaged and unpaved roads is the task of reliable path and obstacle detection. The vast majority of the researches have as scenario roads in good condition, from developed countries. These works cope with few situations of variation on the road surface and even fewer situations presenting surface damages. In this paper we present an approach for road detection considering variation in surface types, identifying paved and unpaved surfaces and also detecting damage and other information on other road surface that may be relevant to driving safety. We also present a new Ground Truth with image segmentation, used in our approach and that allowed us to evaluate our results. Our results show that it is possible to use passive vision for these purposes, even using images captured with low cost cameras.",['cs.CV']
Cross-denoising Network against Corrupted Labels in Medical Image Segmentation with Domain Shift,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have contributed many breakthroughs in segmentation tasks, especially in the field of medical imaging. However, \textit{domain shift} and \textit{corrupted annotations}, which are two common problems in medical imaging, dramatically degrade the performance of DCNNs in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel robust cross-denoising framework using two peer networks to address domain shift and corrupted label problems with a peer-review strategy. Specifically, each network performs as a mentor, mutually supervised to learn from reliable samples selected by the peer network to combat with corrupted labels. In addition, a noise-tolerant loss is proposed to encourage the network to capture the key location and filter the discrepancy under various noise-contaminant labels. To further reduce the accumulated error, we introduce a class-imbalanced cross learning using most confident predictions at the class-level. Experimental results on REFUGE and Drishti-GS datasets for optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach to the state-of-the-art methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Cardiac Segmentation with Strong Anatomical Guarantees,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical imaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the fact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert variability, CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate segmentations, even when built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a framework for producing cardiac image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to respect pre-defined anatomical criteria, while remaining within the inter-expert variability. The idea behind our method is to use a well-trained CNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically implausible results and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid cardiac shape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational autoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes through a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project any implausible shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the closest correct shape. We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as apical two and four-chamber view ultrasound images, two modalities for which cardiac shapes are drastically different. With our method, CNNs can now produce results that are both within the inter-expert variability and always anatomically plausible without having to rely on a shape prior.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Searching Learning Strategy with Reinforcement Learning for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep neural network (DNN) based approaches have been widely investigated and deployed in medical image analysis. For example, fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) achieve the state-of-the-art performance in several applications of 2D/3D medical image segmentation. Even the baseline neural network models (U-Net, V-Net, etc.) have been proven to be very effective and efficient when the training process is set up properly. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potentials of neural networks, we propose an automated searching approach for the optimal training strategy with reinforcement learning. The proposed approach can be utilized for tuning hyper-parameters, and selecting necessary data augmentation with certain probabilities. The proposed approach is validated on several tasks of 3D medical image segmentation. The performance of the baseline model is boosted after searching, and it can achieve comparable accuracy to other manually-tuned state-of-the-art segmentation approaches.",['cs.CV']
Multi-organ Segmentation over Partially Labeled Datasets with Multi-scale Feature Abstraction,"Shortage of fully annotated datasets has been a limiting factor in developing deep learning based image segmentation algorithms and the problem becomes more pronounced in multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we propose a unified training strategy that enables a novel multi-scale deep neural network to be trained on multiple partially labeled datasets for multi-organ segmentation. In addition, a new network architecture for multi-scale feature abstraction is proposed to integrate pyramid input and feature analysis into a U-shape pyramid structure. To bridge the semantic gap caused by directly merging features from different scales, an equal convolutional depth mechanism is introduced. Furthermore, we employ a deep supervision mechanism to refine the outputs in different scales. To fully leverage the segmentation features from all the scales, we design an adaptive weighting layer to fuse the outputs in an automatic fashion. All these mechanisms together are integrated into a Pyramid Input Pyramid Output Feature Abstraction Network (PIPO-FAN). Our proposed method was evaluated on four publicly available datasets, including BTCV, LiTS, KiTS and Spleen, where very promising performance has been achieved. The source code of this work is publicly shared at https://github.com/DIAL-RPI/PIPO-FAN for others to easily reproduce the work and build their own models with the introduced mechanisms.",['cs.CV']
Elastic Boundary Projection for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"We focus on an important yet challenging problem: using a 2D deep network to deal with 3D segmentation for medical image analysis. Existing approaches either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D) networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.   In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in abdominal organ segmentation. Our code has been open-sourced https://github.com/twni2016/Elastic-Boundary-Projection.",['cs.CV']
Traditional Method Inspired Deep Neural Network for Edge Detection,"Recently, Deep-Neural-Network (DNN) based edge prediction is progressing fast. Although the DNN based schemes outperform the traditional edge detectors, they have much higher computational complexity. It could be that the DNN based edge detectors often adopt the neural net structures designed for high-level computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation and object recognition. Edge detection is a rather local and simple job, the over-complicated architecture and massive parameters may be unnecessary. Therefore, we propose a traditional method inspired framework to produce good edges with minimal complexity. We simplify the network architecture to include Feature Extractor, Enrichment, and Summarizer, which roughly correspond to gradient, low pass filter, and pixel connection in the traditional edge detection schemes. The proposed structure can effectively reduce the complexity and retain the edge prediction quality. Our TIN2 (Traditional Inspired Network) model has an accuracy higher than the recent BDCN2 (Bi-Directional Cascade Network) but with a smaller model.",['cs.CV']
Robust Image Segmentation Quality Assessment,"Deep learning based image segmentation methods have achieved great success, even having human-level accuracy in some applications. However, due to the black box nature of deep learning, the best method may fail in some situations. Thus predicting segmentation quality without ground truth would be very crucial especially in clinical practice. Recently, people proposed to train neural networks to estimate the quality score by regression. Although it can achieve promising prediction accuracy, the network suffers robustness problem, e.g. it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem by utilizing the difference between the input image and the reconstructed image, which is conditioned on the segmentation to be assessed, to lower the chance to overfit to the undesired image features from the original input image, and thus to increase the robustness. Results on ACDC17 dataset demonstrated our method is promising.",['cs.CV']
Multi-task deep learning for image segmentation using recursive approximation tasks,"Fully supervised deep neural networks for segmentation usually require a massive amount of pixel-level labels which are manually expensive to create. In this work, we develop a multi-task learning method to relax this constraint. We regard the segmentation problem as a sequence of approximation subproblems that are recursively defined and in increasing levels of approximation accuracy. The subproblems are handled by a framework that consists of 1) a segmentation task that learns from pixel-level ground truth segmentation masks of a small fraction of the images, 2) a recursive approximation task that conducts partial object regions learning and data-driven mask evolution starting from partial masks of each object instance, and 3) other problem oriented auxiliary tasks that are trained with sparse annotations and promote the learning of dedicated features. Most training images are only labeled by (rough) partial masks, which do not contain exact object boundaries, rather than by their full segmentation masks. During the training phase, the approximation task learns the statistics of these partial masks, and the partial regions are recursively increased towards object boundaries aided by the learned information from the segmentation task in a fully data-driven fashion. The network is trained on an extremely small amount of precisely segmented images and a large set of coarse labels. Annotations can thus be obtained in a cheap way. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in three applications with microscopy images and ultrasound images.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"

ECG-DelNet: Delineation of Ambulatory Electrocardiograms with Mixed Quality Labeling Using Neural Networks,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) detection and delineation are key steps for numerous tasks in clinical practice, as ECG is the most performed non-invasive test for assessing cardiac condition. State-of-the-art algorithms employ digital signal processing (DSP), which require laborious rule adaptation to new morphologies. In contrast, deep learning (DL) algorithms, especially for classification, are gaining weight in academic and industrial settings. However, the lack of model explainability and small databases hinder their applicability. We demonstrate DL can be successfully applied to low interpretative tasks by embedding ECG detection and delineation onto a segmentation framework. For this purpose, we adapted and validated the most used neural network architecture for image segmentation, the U-Net, to one-dimensional data. The model was trained using PhysioNet's QT database, comprised of 105 ambulatory ECG recordings, for single- and multi-lead scenarios. To alleviate data scarcity, data regularization techniques such as pre-training with low-quality data labels, performing ECG-based data augmentation and applying strong model regularizers to the architecture were attempted. Other variations in the model's capacity (U-Net's depth and width), alongside the application of state-of-the-art additions, were evaluated. These variations were exhaustively validated in a 5-fold cross-validation manner. The best performing configuration reached precisions of 90.12%, 99.14% and 98.25% and recalls of 98.73%, 99.94% and 99.88% for the P, QRS and T waves, respectively, on par with DSP-based approaches. Despite being a data-hungry technique trained on a small dataset, DL-based approaches demonstrate to be a viable alternative to traditional DSP-based ECG processing techniques.","['cs.LG', 'eess.SP', 'stat.ML']"
Transformation Consistent Self-ensembling Model for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on a variety of medical image computing tasks. A common problem when applying supervised deep learning methods to medical images is the lack of labeled data, which is very expensive and time-consuming to be collected. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised method for medical image segmentation, where the network is optimized by the weighted combination of a common supervised loss for labeled inputs only and a regularization loss for both labeled and unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages the consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different regularizations. Aiming for the semi-supervised segmentation problem, we enhance the effect of regularization for pixel-level predictions by introducing a transformation, including rotation and flipping, consistent scheme in our self-ensembling model. With the aim of semi-supervised segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation consistent strategy in our self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions. We have extensively validated the proposed semi-supervised method on three typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks: (i) skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images on International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 dataset, (ii) optic disc segmentation from fundus images on Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) dataset, and (iii) liver segmentation from volumetric CT scans on Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) dataset.

Lake Ice Monitoring with Webcams and Crowd-Sourced Images,"Lake ice is a strong climate indicator and has been recognised as part of the Essential Climate Variables (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). The dynamics of freezing and thawing, and possible shifts of freezing patterns over time, can help in understanding the local and global climate systems. One way to acquire the spatio-temporal information about lake ice formation, independent of clouds, is to analyse webcam images. This paper intends to move towards a universal model for monitoring lake ice with freely available webcam data. We demonstrate good performance, including the ability to generalise across different winters and different lakes, with a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for semantic image segmentation, Deeplab v3+. Moreover, we design a variant of that model, termed Deep-U-Lab, which predicts sharper, more correct segmentation boundaries. We have tested the model's ability to generalise with data from multiple camera views and two different winters. On average, it achieves intersection-over-union (IoU) values of ~71% across different cameras and ~69% across different winters, greatly outperforming prior work. Going even further, we show that the model even achieves 60% IoU on arbitrary images scraped from photo-sharing web sites. As part of the work, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of webcam images, Photi-LakeIce, from multiple cameras and two different winters, along with pixel-wise ground truth annotations.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Meta-Learning Initializations for Image Segmentation,"We extend first-order model agnostic meta-learning algorithms (including FOMAML and Reptile) to image segmentation, present a novel neural network architecture built for fast learning which we call EfficientLab, and leverage a formal definition of the test error of meta-learning algorithms to decrease error on out of distribution tasks. We show state of the art results on the FSS-1000 dataset by meta-training EfficientLab with FOMAML and using Bayesian optimization to infer the optimal test-time adaptation routine hyperparameters. We also construct a small benchmark dataset, FP-k, for the empirical study of how meta-learning systems perform in both few- and many-shot settings. On the FP-k dataset, we show that meta-learned initializations provide value for canonical few-shot image segmentation but their performance is quickly matched by conventional transfer learning with performance being equal beyond 10 labeled examples. Our code, meta-learned model, and the FP-k dataset are available at https://github.com/ml4ai/mliis .","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Partly Supervised Multitask Learning,"Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an alternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled data. Moreover, optimizing a model for multiple tasks can provide better generalizability than single-task learning. Leveraging self-supervision and adversarial training, we propose a novel general purpose semi-supervised, multiple-task model---namely, self-supervised, semi-supervised, multitask learning (S$^4$MTL)---for accomplishing two important tasks in medical imaging, segmentation and diagnostic classification. Experimental results on chest and spine X-ray datasets suggest that our S$^4$MTL model significantly outperforms semi-supervised single task, semi/fully-supervised multitask, and fully-supervised single task models, even with a 50\% reduction of class and segmentation labels. We hypothesize that our proposed model can be effective in tackling limited annotation problems for joint training, not only in medical imaging domains, but also for general-purpose vision tasks.",['cs.CV']
SimPropNet: Improved Similarity Propagation for Few-shot Image Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods perform image segmentation for a particular object class in a target (query) image, using a small set of (support) image-mask pairs. Recent deep neural network based FSS methods leverage high-dimensional feature similarity between the foreground features of the support images and the query image features. In this work, we demonstrate gaps in the utilization of this similarity information in existing methods, and present a framework - SimPropNet, to bridge those gaps. We propose to jointly predict the support and query masks to force the support features to share characteristics with the query features. We also propose to utilize similarities in the background regions of the query and support images using a novel foreground-background attentive fusion mechanism. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results for one-shot and five-shot segmentation on the PASCAL-5i dataset. The paper includes detailed analysis and ablation studies for the proposed improvements and quantitative comparisons with contemporary methods.",['cs.CV']
ACCL: Adversarial constrained-CNN loss for weakly supervised medical image segmentation,"We propose adversarial constrained-CNN loss, a new paradigm of constrained-CNN loss methods, for weakly supervised medical image segmentation. In the new paradigm, prior knowledge is encoded and depicted by reference masks, and is further employed to impose constraints on segmentation outputs through adversarial learning with reference masks. Unlike pseudo label methods for weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a discriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to be paired with specific images. Our new paradigm not only greatly facilitates imposing prior knowledge on network's outputs, but also provides stronger and higher-order constraints, i.e., distribution approximation, through adversarial learning. Extensive experiments involving different medical modalities, different anatomical structures, different topologies of the object of interest, different levels of prior knowledge and weakly supervised annotations with different annotation ratios is conducted to evaluate our ACCL method. Consistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss method have been achieved, some of which are close to the results of full supervision, thus fully verifying the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Specifically, we report an average Dice score of 75.4% with an average annotation ratio of 0.65%, surpassing the prior art, i.e., the size constrained-CNN loss method, by a large margin of 11.4%. Our codes are made publicly available at https://github.com/PengyiZhang/ACCL.",['cs.CV']
Feedback U-net for Cell Image Segmentation,"Human brain is a layered structure, and performs not only a feedforward process from a lower layer to an upper layer but also a feedback process from an upper layer to a lower layer. The layer is a collection of neurons, and neural network is a mathematical model of the function of neurons. Although neural network imitates the human brain, everyone uses only feedforward process from the lower layer to the upper layer, and feedback process from the upper layer to the lower layer is not used. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Feedback U-Net using Convolutional LSTM which is the segmentation method using Convolutional LSTM and feedback process. The output of U-net gave feedback to the input, and the second round is performed. By using Convolutional LSTM, the features in the second round are extracted based on the features acquired in the first round. On both of the Drosophila cell image and Mouse cell image datasets, our method outperformed conventional U-Net which uses only feedforward process.",['cs.CV']
LSM: Learning Subspace Minimization for Low-level Vision,"We study the energy minimization problem in low-level vision tasks from a novel perspective. We replace the heuristic regularization term with a learnable subspace constraint, and preserve the data term to exploit domain knowledge derived from the first principle of a task. This learning subspace minimization (LSM) framework unifies the network structures and the parameters for many low-level vision tasks, which allows us to train a single network for multiple tasks simultaneously with completely shared parameters, and even generalizes the trained network to an unseen task as long as its data term can be formulated. We demonstrate our LSM framework on four low-level tasks including interactive image segmentation, video segmentation, stereo matching, and optical flow, and validate the network on various datasets. The experiments show that the proposed LSM generates state-of-the-art results with smaller model size, faster training convergence, and real-time inference.",['cs.CV']
Color Image Segmentation using Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization and Fuzzy C-means,"Segmentation partitions an image into different regions containing pixels with similar attributes. A standard non-contextual variant of Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM), considering its simplicity is generally used in image segmentation. Using FCM has its disadvantages like it is dependent on the initial guess of the number of clusters and highly sensitive to noise. Satisfactory visual segments cannot be obtained using FCM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms and has good convergence speed and fewer parameters compared to Genetic Algorithms (GAs). An optimized version of PSO can be combined with FCM to act as a proper initializer for the algorithm thereby reducing its sensitivity to initial guess. A hybrid PSO algorithm named Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) which improves in the calculation of various hyper parameters like inertia weight, learning factors over standard PSO, using insights from swarm behaviour, leading to improvement in cluster quality can be used. This paper presents a new image segmentation algorithm called Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization and Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm (APSOF), which is based on Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering. Experimental results show that APSOF algorithm has edge over FCM in correctly identifying the optimum cluster centers, there by leading to accurate classification of the image pixels. Hence, APSOF algorithm has superior performance in comparison with classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) for image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
A generic ensemble based deep convolutional neural network for semi-supervised medical image segmentation,"Deep learning based image segmentation has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many medical applications such as lesion quantification, organ detection, etc. However, most of the methods rely on supervised learning, which require a large set of high-quality labeled data. Data annotation is generally an extremely time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose a generic semi-supervised learning framework for image segmentation based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). An encoder-decoder based DCNN is initially trained using a few annotated training samples. This initially trained model is then copied into sub-models and improved iteratively using random subsets of unlabeled data with pseudo labels generated from models trained in the previous iteration. The number of sub-models is gradually decreased to one in the final iteration. We evaluate the proposed method on a public grand-challenge dataset for skin lesion segmentation. Our method is able to significantly improve beyond fully supervised model learning by incorporating unlabeled data.",['cs.CV']
Real-Time High-Performance Semantic Image Segmentation of Urban Street Scenes,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales. Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both shallow and deep features from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) with the inference speed of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card). This demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.",['cs.CV']
RSS-Net: Weakly-Supervised Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation with FMCW Radar,"This paper presents an efficient annotation procedure and an application thereof to end-to-end, rich semantic segmentation of the sensed environment using FMCW scanning radar. We advocate radar over the traditional sensors used for this task as it operates at longer ranges and is substantially more robust to adverse weather and illumination conditions. We avoid laborious manual labelling by exploiting the largest radar-focused urban autonomy dataset collected to date, correlating radar scans with RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors, for which semantic segmentation is an already consolidated procedure. The training procedure leverages a state-of-the-art natural image segmentation system which is publicly available and as such, in contrast to previous approaches, allows for the production of copious labels for the radar stream by incorporating four camera and two LiDAR streams. Additionally, the losses are computed taking into account labels to the radar sensor horizon by accumulating LiDAR returns along a pose-chain ahead and behind of the current vehicle position. Finally, we present the network with multi-channel radar scan inputs in order to deal with ephemeral and dynamic scene objects.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
Improving land cover segmentation across satellites using domain adaptation,"Land use and land cover mapping are essential to various fields of study, including forestry, agriculture, and urban management. Using earth observation satellites both facilitate and accelerate the task. Lately, deep learning methods have proven to be excellent at automating the mapping via semantic image segmentation. However, because deep neural networks require large amounts of labeled data, it is not easy to exploit the full potential of satellite imagery. Additionally, the land cover tends to differ in appearance from one region to another; therefore, having labeled data from one location does not necessarily help in mapping others. Furthermore, satellite images come in various multispectral bands (the bands could range from RGB to over twelve bands). In this paper, we aim at using domain adaptation to solve the aforementioned problems. We applied a well-performing domain adaptation approach on datasets we have built using RGB images from Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, and Pleiades-1 satellites with Corine Land Cover as ground-truth labels. We have also used the DeepGlobe land cover dataset. Experiments show a significant improvement over results obtained without the use of domain adaptation. In some cases, an improvement of over 20% MIoU. At times it even manages to correct errors in the ground-truth labels.",['cs.CV']
Gen-LaneNet: A Generalized and Scalable Approach for 3D Lane Detection,"We present a generalized and scalable method, called Gen-LaneNet, to detect 3D lanes from a single image. The method, inspired by the latest state-of-the-art 3D-LaneNet, is a unified framework solving image encoding, spatial transform of features and 3D lane prediction in a single network. However, we propose unique designs for Gen-LaneNet in two folds. First, we introduce a new geometry-guided lane anchor representation in a new coordinate frame and apply a specific geometric transformation to directly calculate real 3D lane points from the network output. We demonstrate that aligning the lane points with the underlying top-view features in the new coordinate frame is critical towards a generalized method in handling unfamiliar scenes. Second, we present a scalable two-stage framework that decouples the learning of image segmentation subnetwork and geometry encoding subnetwork. Compared to 3D-LaneNet, the proposed Gen-LaneNet drastically reduces the amount of 3D lane labels required to achieve a robust solution in real-world application. Moreover, we release a new synthetic dataset and its construction strategy to encourage the development and evaluation of 3D lane detection methods. In experiments, we conduct extensive ablation study to substantiate the proposed Gen-LaneNet significantly outperforms 3D-LaneNet in average precision(AP) and F-score.",['cs.CV']
Out-of-Distribution Detection in Multi-Label Datasets using Latent Space of $β$-VAE,"Learning Enabled Components (LECs) are widely being used in a variety of perception based autonomy tasks like image segmentation, object detection, end-to-end driving, etc. These components are trained with large image datasets with multimodal factors like weather conditions, time-of-day, traffic-density, etc. The LECs learn from these factors during training, and while testing if there is variation in any of these factors, the components get confused resulting in low confidence predictions. The images with factors not seen during training is commonly referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). For safe autonomy it is important to identify the OOD images, so that a suitable mitigation strategy can be performed. Classical one-class classifiers like SVM and SVDD are used to perform OOD detection. However, the multiple labels attached to the images in these datasets, restricts the direct application of these techniques. We address this problem using the latent space of the $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE). We use the fact that compact latent space generated by an appropriately selected $\beta$-VAE will encode the information about these factors in a few latent variables, and that can be used for computationally inexpensive detection. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset, and our results shows the latent space of $\beta$-VAE is sensitive to encode changes in the values of the generative factor.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
PADDIT: Probabilistic Augmentation of Data using Diffeomorphic Image Transformation,"For proper generalization performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, the learnt features should be invariant under particular non-linear shape variations of the input. To induce invariance in CNNs to such transformations, we propose Probabilistic Augmentation of Data using Diffeomorphic Image Transformation (PADDIT) -- a systematic framework for generating realistic transformations that can be used to augment data for training CNNs. We show that CNNs trained with PADDIT outperforms CNNs trained without augmentation and with generic augmentation in segmenting white matter hyperintensities from T1 and FLAIR brain MRI scans.",['cs.CV']
StructBoost: Boosting Methods for Predicting Structured Output Variables,"Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured learning has found many applications in computer vision. Inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose a new boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear structured learning by combining a set of weak structured learners. As SSVM generalizes SVM, our StructBoost generalizes standard boosting approaches such as AdaBoost, or LPBoost to structured learning. The resulting optimization problem of StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense that it may involve exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast, for SSVM one usually has an exponential number of constraints and a cutting-plane method is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we formulate an equivalent $ 1 $-slack formulation and solve it using a combination of cutting planes and column generation. We show the versatility and usefulness of StructBoost on a range of problems such as optimizing the tree loss for hierarchical multi-class classification, optimizing the Pascal overlap criterion for robust visual tracking and learning conditional random field parameters for image segmentation.",['cs.LG']
Semi-Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Self-correcting Networks,"Building a large image dataset with high-quality object masks for semantic segmentation is costly and time consuming. In this paper, we introduce a principled semi-supervised framework that only uses a small set of fully supervised images (having semantic segmentation labels and box labels) and a set of images with only object bounding box labels (we call it the weak set). Our framework trains the primary segmentation model with the aid of an ancillary model that generates initial segmentation labels for the weak set and a self-correction module that improves the generated labels during training using the increasingly accurate primary model. We introduce two variants of the self-correction module using either linear or convolutional functions. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscape datasets show that our models trained with a small fully supervised set perform similar to, or better than, models trained with a large fully supervised set while requiring ~7x less annotation effort.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Dam Burst: A region-merging-based image segmentation method,"Until now, all single level segmentation algorithms except CNN-based ones lead to over segmentation. And CNN-based segmentation algorithms have their own problems. To avoid over segmentation, multiple thresholds of criteria are adopted in region merging process to produce hierarchical segmentation results. However, there still has extreme over segmentation in the low level of the hierarchy, and outstanding tiny objects are merged to their large adjacencies in the high level of the hierarchy. This paper proposes a region-merging-based image segmentation method that we call it Dam Burst. As a single level segmentation algorithm, this method avoids over segmentation and retains details by the same time. It is named because of that it simulates a flooding from underground destroys dams between water-pools. We treat edge detection results as strengthening structure of a dam if it is on the dam. To simulate a flooding from underground, regions are merged by ascending order of the average gra-dient inside the region.",['cs.CV']
MixModule: Mixed CNN Kernel Module for Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to medical image classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Among the many CNNs architectures, U-Net and its improved versions based are widely used and achieve state-of-the-art performance these years. These improved architectures focus on structural improvements and the size of the convolution kernel is generally fixed. In this paper, we propose a module that combines the benefits of multiple kernel sizes and we apply the proposed module to U-Net and its variants. We test our module on three segmentation benchmark datasets and experimental results show significant improvement.",['cs.CV']
A Variational Image Segmentation Model based on Normalized Cut with Adaptive Similarity and Spatial Regularization,"Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and computer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of segmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the Normalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good performance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose energy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation results of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed similarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically by users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an adaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model combines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut energy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method can adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some parameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a better similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide some mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from multi-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the regularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a robust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the similarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the existence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper. Compared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional Ncut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments show that our method can provide promising segmentation results.",['cs.CV']
Non-local U-Net for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning has shown its great promise in various biomedical image segmentation tasks. Existing models are typically based on U-Net and rely on an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked local operators to aggregate long-range information gradually. However, only using the local operators limits the efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose the non-local U-Nets, which are equipped with flexible global aggregation blocks, for biomedical image segmentation. These blocks can be inserted into U-Net as size-preserving processes, as well as down-sampling and up-sampling layers. We perform thorough experiments on the 3D multimodality isointense infant brain MR image segmentation task to evaluate the non-local U-Nets. Results show that our proposed models achieve top performances with fewer parameters and faster computation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML']"
Building Networks for Image Segmentation using Particle Competition and Cooperation,"Particle competition and cooperation (PCC) is a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach. When PCC is applied to interactive image segmentation tasks, pixels are converted into network nodes, and each node is connected to its k-nearest neighbors, according to the distance between a set of features extracted from the image. Building a proper network to feed PCC is crucial to achieve good segmentation results. However, some features may be more important than others to identify the segments, depending on the characteristics of the image to be segmented. In this paper, an index to evaluate candidate networks is proposed. Thus, building the network becomes a problem of optimizing some feature weights based on the proposed index. Computer simulations are performed on some real-world images from the Microsoft GrabCut database, and the segmentation results related in this paper show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']"
Simple Interactive Image Segmentation using Label Propagation through kNN graphs,"Many interactive image segmentation techniques are based on semi-supervised learning. The user may label some pixels from each object and the SSL algorithm will propagate the labels from the labeled to the unlabeled pixels, finding object boundaries. This paper proposes a new SSL graph-based interactive image segmentation approach, using undirected and unweighted kNN graphs, from which the unlabeled nodes receive contributions from other nodes (either labeled or unlabeled). It is simpler than many other techniques, but it still achieves significant classification accuracy in the image segmentation task. Computer simulations are performed using some real-world images, extracted from the Microsoft GrabCut dataset. The segmentation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
One-pass Multi-task Networks with Cross-task Guided Attention for Brain Tumor Segmentation,"Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image segmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the class imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation among the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model, i.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better than MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists of shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific parameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively optimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between tasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the category-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing method is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing set and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we also won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating teams.

Adversarial normalization for multi domain image segmentation,"Image normalization is a critical step in medical imaging. This step is often done on a per-dataset basis, preventing current segmentation algorithms from the full potential of exploiting jointly normalized information across multiple datasets. To solve this problem, we propose an adversarial normalization approach for image segmentation which learns common normalizing functions across multiple datasets while retaining image realism. The adversarial training provides an optimal normalizer that improves both the segmentation accuracy and the discrimination of unrealistic normalizing functions. Our contribution therefore leverages common imaging information from multiple domains. The optimality of our common normalizer is evaluated by combining brain images from both infants and adults. Results on the challenging iSEG and MRBrainS datasets reveal the potential of our adversarial normalization approach for segmentation, with Dice improvements of up to 59.6% over the baseline.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
Training Generative Adversarial Networks from Incomplete Observations using Factorised Discriminators,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great success in applications such as image generation and inpainting. However, they typically require large datasets, which are often not available, especially in the context of prediction tasks such as image segmentation that require labels. Therefore, methods such as the CycleGAN use more easily available unlabelled data, but do not offer a way to leverage additional labelled data for improved performance. To address this shortcoming, we show how to factorise the joint data distribution into a set of lower-dimensional distributions along with their dependencies. This allows splitting the discriminator in a GAN into multiple ""sub-discriminators"" that can be independently trained from incomplete observations. Their outputs can be combined to estimate the density ratio between the joint real and the generator distribution, which enables training generators as in the original GAN framework. We apply our method to image generation, image segmentation and audio source separation, and obtain improved performance over a standard GAN when additional incomplete training examples are available. For the Cityscapes segmentation task in particular, our method also improves accuracy by an absolute 14.9% over CycleGAN while using only 25 additional paired examples.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Observer variation-aware medical image segmentation by combining deep learning and surrogate-assisted genetic algorithms,"There has recently been great progress in automatic segmentation of medical images with deep learning algorithms. In most works observer variation is acknowledged to be a problem as it makes training data heterogeneous but so far no attempts have been made to explicitly capture this variation. Here, we propose an approach capable of mimicking different styles of segmentation, which potentially can improve quality and clinical acceptance of automatic segmentation methods. In this work, instead of training one neural network on all available data, we train several neural networks on subgroups of data belonging to different segmentation variations separately. Because a priori it may be unclear what styles of segmentation exist in the data and because different styles do not necessarily map one-on-one to different observers, the subgroups should be automatically determined. We achieve this by searching for the best data partition with a genetic algorithm. Therefore, each network can learn a specific style of segmentation from grouped training data. We provide proof of principle results for open-sourced prostate segmentation MRI data with simulated observer variations. Our approach provides an improvement of up to 23% (depending on simulated variations) in terms of Dice and surface Dice coefficients compared to one network trained on all data.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'eess.IV']"
Hierarchical Modeling of Multidimensional Data in Regularly Decomposed Spaces: Synthesis and Perspective,"This fourth and last tome is focusing on describing the envisioned works for a project that has been presented in the preceding tome. It is about a new approach dedicated to the coding of still and moving pictures, trying to bridge the MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 standard bodies. The aim of this project is to define the principles of self-descriptive video coding. In order to establish them, the document is composed in five chapters that describe the various envisioned techniques for developing such a new approach in visual coding: - image segmentation, - computation of visual descriptors, - computation of perceptual groupings, - building of visual dictionaries, - picture and video coding. Based on the techniques of multiresolution computing, it is proposed to develop an image segmentation made from piecewise regular components, to compute attributes on the frame and the rendering of so produced shapes, independently to the geometric transforms that can occur in the image plane, and to gather them into perceptual groupings so as to be able in performing recognition of partially hidden patterns. Due to vector quantization of shapes frame and rendering, it will appear that simple shapes may be compared to a visual alphabet and that complex shapes then become words written using this alphabet and be recorded into a dictionary. With the help of a nearest neighbour scanning applied on the picture shapes, the self-descriptive coding will then generate a sentence made from words written using the simple shape alphabet.",['cs.CV']
Unpaired Multi-modal Segmentation via Knowledge Distillation,"Multi-modal learning is typically performed with network architectures containing modality-specific layers and shared layers, utilizing co-registered images of different modalities. We propose a novel learning scheme for unpaired cross-modality image segmentation, with a highly compact architecture achieving superior segmentation accuracy. In our method, we heavily reuse network parameters, by sharing all convolutional kernels across CT and MRI, and only employ modality-specific internal normalization layers which compute respective statistics. To effectively train such a highly compact model, we introduce a novel loss term inspired by knowledge distillation, by explicitly constraining the KL-divergence of our derived prediction distributions between modalities. We have extensively validated our approach on two multi-class segmentation problems: i) cardiac structure segmentation, and ii) abdominal organ segmentation. Different network settings, i.e., 2D dilated network and 3D U-net, are utilized to investigate our method's general efficacy. Experimental results on both tasks demonstrate that our novel multi-modal learning scheme consistently outperforms single-modal training and previous multi-modal approaches.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Neural ODEs for Image Segmentation with Level Sets,"We propose a novel approach for image segmentation that combines Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the Level Set method. Our approach parametrizes the evolution of an initial contour with a NODE that implicitly learns from data a speed function describing the evolution. In addition, for cases where an initial contour is not available and to alleviate the need for careful choice or design of contour embedding functions, we propose a NODE-based method that evolves an image embedding into a dense per-pixel semantic label space. We evaluate our methods on kidney segmentation (KiTS19) and on salient object detection (PASCAL-S, ECSSD and HKU-IS). In addition to improving initial contours provided by deep learning models while using a fraction of their number of parameters, our approach achieves F scores that are higher than several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Multi-focus Image Fusion Based on Similarity Characteristics,"A novel multi-focus image fusion algorithm performed in spatial domain based on similarity characteristics is proposed incorporating with region segmentation. In this paper, a new similarity measure is developed based on the structural similarity (SSIM) index, which is more suitable for multi-focus image segmentation. Firstly, the SSNSIM map is calculated between two input images. Then we segment the SSNSIM map using watershed method, and merge the small homogeneous regions with fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM). For three source images, a joint region segmentation method based on segmentation of two images is used to obtain the final segmentation result. Finally, the corresponding segmented regions of the source images are fused according to their average gradient. The performance of the image fusion method is evaluated by several criteria including spatial frequency, average gradient, entropy, edge retention etc. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed method is effective and has good visual perception.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Greenery Segmentation In Urban Images By Deep Learning,Vegetation is a relevant feature in the urban scenery and its awareness can be measured in an image by the Green View Index (GVI).

End-to-end Training of CNN-CRF via Differentiable Dual-Decomposition,"Modern computer vision (CV) is often based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that excel at hierarchical feature extraction. The previous generation of CV approaches was often based on conditional random fields (CRFs) that excel at modeling flexible higher order interactions. As their benefits are complementary they are often combined. However, these approaches generally use mean-field approximations and thus, arguably, did not directly optimize the real problem. Here we revisit dual-decomposition-based approaches to CRF optimization, an alternative to the mean-field approximation. These algorithms can efficiently and exactly solve sub-problems and directly optimize a convex upper bound of the real problem, providing optimality certificates on the way. Our approach uses a novel fixed-point iteration algorithm which enjoys dual-monotonicity, dual-differentiability and high parallelism. The whole system, CRF and CNN can thus be efficiently trained using back-propagation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on semantic image segmentation, showing consistent improvement over baseline models.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
PI-RCNN: An Efficient Multi-sensor 3D Object Detector with Point-based Attentive Cont-conv Fusion Module,"LIDAR point clouds and RGB-images are both extremely essential for 3D object detection. So many state-of-the-art 3D detection algorithms dedicate in fusing these two types of data effectively. However, their fusion methods based on Birds Eye View (BEV) or voxel format are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion approach named Point-based Attentive Cont-conv Fusion(PACF) module, which fuses multi-sensor features directly on 3D points. Except for continuous convolution, we additionally add a Point-Pooling and an Attentive Aggregation to make the fused features more expressive. Moreover, based on the PACF module, we propose a 3D multi-sensor multi-task network called Pointcloud-Image RCNN(PI-RCNN as brief), which handles the image segmentation and 3D object detection tasks. PI-RCNN employs a segmentation sub-network to extract full-resolution semantic feature maps from images and then fuses the multi-sensor features via powerful PACF module. Beneficial from the effectiveness of the PACF module and the expressive semantic features from the segmentation module, PI-RCNN can improve much in 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the PACF module and PI-RCNN on the KITTI 3D Detection benchmark, and our method can achieve state-of-the-art on the metric of 3D AP.",['cs.CV']
Transform the Set: Memory Attentive Generation of Guided and Unguided Image Collages,"Cutting and pasting image segments feels intuitive: the choice of source templates gives artists flexibility in recombining existing source material. Formally, this process takes an image set as input and outputs a collage of the set elements. Such selection from sets of source templates does not fit easily in classical convolutional neural models requiring inputs of fixed size. Inspired by advances in attention and set-input machine learning, we present a novel architecture that can generate in one forward pass image collages of source templates using set-structured representations. This paper has the following contributions: (i) a novel framework for image generation called Memory Attentive Generation of Image Collages (MAGIC) which gives artists new ways to create digital collages; (ii) from the machine-learning perspective, we show a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architecture that uses Set-Transformer layers and set-pooling to blend sets of random image samples - a hybrid non-parametric approach.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Pixel Level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Semantic segmentation is one of the basic topics in computer vision, it aims to assign semantic labels to every pixel of an image. Unbalanced semantic label distribution could have a negative influence on segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we investigate using data augmentation approach to balance the semantic label distribution in order to improve segmentation performance. We propose using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic images for improving the performance of semantic segmentation networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only improve segmentation performance on those classes with low accuracy, but also obtain 1.3% to 2.1% increase in average segmentation accuracy. It shows that this augmentation method can boost accuracy and be easily applicable to any other segmentation models.",['cs.CV']
Identify the cells' nuclei based on the deep learning neural network,"Identify the cells' nuclei is the important point for most medical analyses. To assist doctors finding the accurate cell' nuclei location automatically is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural network (FCNs) serve as the back-bone in many image segmentation, like liver and tumer segmentation in medical field, human body block in technical filed. The cells' nuclei identification task is also kind of image segmentation. To achieve this, we prefer to use deep learning algorithms. we construct three general frameworks, one is Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN), which has the high performance in many image segmentations, one is U-net, which has the high generalization performance on small dataset and the other is DenseUNet, which is mixture network architecture with Dense Net and U-net. we compare the performance of these three frameworks. And we evaluated our method on the dataset of data science bowl 2018 challenge. For single model without any ensemble, they all have good performance.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Automated Weed Detection in Aerial Imagery with Context,"In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated maize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context surrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have brought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when objects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs when objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct differences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or localized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when classifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional neural network a central square image along with a border of its direct surroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are labelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network classifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We demonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task through a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed detection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone nearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one epoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the network without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context technique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which parts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking into account the context in which those parts appear.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
An Approach for Adaptive Automatic Threat Recognition Within 3D Computed Tomography Images for Baggage Security Screening,"The screening of baggage using X-ray scanners is now routine in aviation security with automatic threat detection approaches, based on 3D X-ray computed tomography (CT) images, known as Automatic Threat Recognition (ATR) within the aviation security industry. These current strategies use pre-defined threat material signatures in contrast to adaptability towards new and emerging threat signatures. To address this issue, the concept of adaptive automatic threat recognition (AATR) was proposed in previous work. In this paper, we present a solution to AATR based on such X-ray CT baggage scan imagery. This aims to address the issues of rapidly evolving threat signatures within the screening requirements. Ideally, the detection algorithms deployed within the security scanners should be readily adaptable to different situations with varying requirements of threat characteristics (e.g., threat material, physical properties of objects). We tackle this issue using a novel adaptive machine learning methodology with our solution consisting of a multi-scale 3D CT image segmentation algorithm, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier for object material recognition and a strategy to enable the adaptability of our approach. Experiments are conducted on both open and sequestered 3D CT baggage image datasets specifically collected for the AATR study. Our proposed approach performs well on both recognition and adaptation. Overall our approach can achieve the probability of detection around 90% with a probability of false alarm below 20%. Our AATR shows the capabilities of adapting to varying types of materials, even the unknown materials which are not available in the training data, adapting to varying required probability of detection and adapting to varying scales of the threat object.","['cs.CV', 'cs.SY']"
Automatic Image Co-Segmentation: A Survey,"Image co-segmentation is important for its advantage of alleviating the ill-pose nature of image segmentation through exploring the correlation between related images. Many automatic image co-segmentation algorithms have been developed in the last decade, which are investigated comprehensively in this paper. We firstly analyze visual/semantic cues for guiding image co-segmentation, including object cues and correlation cues. Then we describe the traditional methods in three categories of object elements based, object regions/contours based, common object model based. In the next part, deep learning based methods are reviewed. Furthermore, widely used test datasets and evaluation criteria are introduced and the reported performances of the surveyed algorithms are compared with each other. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and possible future directions and conclude the paper. Hopefully, this comprehensive investigation will be helpful for the development of image co-segmentation technique.",['cs.CV']
Signal Clustering with Class-independent Segmentation,"Radar signals have been dramatically increasing in complexity, limiting the source separation ability of traditional approaches. In this paper we propose a Deep Learning-based clustering method, which encodes concurrent signals into images, and, for the first time, tackles clustering with image segmentation. Novel loss functions are introduced to optimize a Neural Network to separate the input pulses into pure and non-fragmented clusters. Outperforming a variety of baselines, the proposed approach is capable of clustering inputs directly with a Neural Network, in an end-to-end fashion.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.SP']"
Cost-efficient segmentation of electron microscopy images using active learning,"Over the last decade, electron microscopy has improved up to a point that generating high quality gigavoxel sized datasets only requires a few hours. Automated image analysis, particularly image segmentation, however, has not evolved at the same pace. Even though state-of-the-art methods such as U-Net and DeepLab have improved segmentation performance substantially, the required amount of labels remains too expensive. Active learning is the subfield in machine learning that aims to mitigate this burden by selecting the samples that require labeling in a smart way. Many techniques have been proposed, particularly for image classification, to increase the steepness of learning curves. In this work, we extend these techniques to deep CNN based image segmentation. Our experiments on three different electron microscopy datasets show that active learning can improve segmentation quality by 10 to 15% in terms of Jaccard score compared to standard randomized sampling.",['cs.CV']
"One Network to Segment Them All: A General, Lightweight System for Accurate 3D Medical Image Segmentation","Many recent medical segmentation systems rely on powerful deep learning models to solve highly specific tasks. To maximize performance, it is standard practice to evaluate numerous pipelines with varying model topologies, optimization parameters, pre- & postprocessing steps, and even model cascades. It is often not clear how the resulting pipeline transfers to different tasks. We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no task-specific information, no human interaction and is based on a fixed model topology and a fixed hyperparameter set, eliminating the process of model selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10 tasks. The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net. Multi-planar training combines the parameter efficiency of a 2D fully convolutional neural network with a systematic train- and test-time augmentation scheme, which allows the 2D model to learn a representation of the 3D image volume that fosters generalization.","['cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Consistency under Transformations,"The scarcity of labeled data often limits the application of supervised deep learning techniques for medical image segmentation. This has motivated the development of semi-supervised techniques that learn from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled images. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method that, in addition to supervised learning on labeled training images, learns to predict segmentations consistent under a given class of transformations on both labeled and unlabeled images. More specifically, in this work we explore learning equivariance to elastic deformations. We implement this through: 1) a Siamese architecture with two identical branches, each of which receives a differently transformed image, and 2) a composite loss function with a supervised segmentation loss term and an unsupervised term that encourages segmentation consistency between the predictions of the two branches. We evaluate the method on a public dataset of chest radiographs with segmentations of anatomical structures using 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed method reaches significantly higher segmentation accuracy compared to supervised learning. This is due to learning transformation consistency on both labeled and unlabeled images, with the latter contributing the most. We achieve the performance comparable to state-of-the-art chest X-ray segmentation methods while using substantially fewer labeled images.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Gated CRF Loss for Weakly Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation,"State-of-the-art approaches for semantic segmentation rely on deep convolutional neural networks trained on fully annotated datasets, that have been shown to be notoriously expensive to collect, both in terms of time and money. To remedy this situation, weakly supervised methods leverage other forms of supervision that require substantially less annotation effort, but they typically present an inability to predict precise object boundaries due to approximate nature of the supervisory signals in those regions. While great progress has been made in improving the performance, many of these weakly supervised methods are highly tailored to their own specific settings. This raises challenges in reusing algorithms and making steady progress. In this paper, we intentionally avoid such practices when tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In particular, we train standard neural networks with partial cross-entropy loss function for the labeled pixels and our proposed Gated CRF loss for the unlabeled pixels. The Gated CRF loss is designed to deliver several important assets: 1) it enables flexibility in the kernel construction to mask out influence from undesired pixel positions; 2) it offloads learning contextual relations to CNN and concentrates on semantic boundaries; 3) it does not rely on high-dimensional filtering and thus has a simple implementation. Throughout the paper we present the advantages of the loss function, analyze several aspects of weakly supervised training, and show that our `purist' approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both click-based and scribble-based annotations.",['cs.CV']
Domain Generalization via Model-Agnostic Learning of Semantic Features,"Generalization capability to unseen domains is crucial for machine learning models when deploying to real-world conditions. We investigate the challenging problem of domain generalization, i.e., training a model on multi-domain source data such that it can directly generalize to target domains with unknown statistics. We adopt a model-agnostic learning paradigm with gradient-based meta-train and meta-test procedures to expose the optimization to domain shift. Further, we introduce two complementary losses which explicitly regularize the semantic structure of the feature space. Globally, we align a derived soft confusion matrix to preserve general knowledge about inter-class relationships. Locally, we promote domain-independent class-specific cohesion and separation of sample features with a metric-learning component. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with new state-of-the-art results on two common object recognition benchmarks. Our method also shows consistent improvement on a medical image segmentation task.",['cs.CV']
PT-ResNet: Perspective Transformation-Based Residual Network for Semantic Road Image Segmentation,"Semantic road region segmentation is a high-level task, which paves the way towards road scene understanding. This paper presents a residual network trained for semantic road segmentation. Firstly, we represent the projections of road disparities in the v-disparity map as a linear model, which can be estimated by optimizing the v-disparity map using dynamic programming. This linear model is then utilized to reduce the redundant information in the left and right road images. The right image is also transformed into the left perspective view, which greatly enhances the road surface similarity between the two images. Finally, the processed stereo images and their disparity maps are concatenated to create a set of 3D images, which are then utilized to train our neural network. The experimental results illustrate that our network achieves a maximum F1-measure of approximately 91.19% when analyzing the images from the KITTI road dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.RO', 'eess.IV']"
Anchor Diffusion for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,"Unsupervised video object segmentation has often been tackled by methods based on recurrent neural networks and optical flow. Despite their complexity, these kinds of approaches tend to favour short-term temporal dependencies and are thus prone to accumulating inaccuracies, which cause drift over time. Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators of [70], we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel embeddings of a reference ""anchor"" frame and the current one. This allows the learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without conditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach can suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in challenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time. With a mean IoU of $81.7\%$, our method ranks first on the DAVIS-2016 leaderboard of unsupervised methods, while still being competitive against state-of-the-art online semi-supervised approaches. We further evaluate our method on the FBMS dataset and the ViSal video saliency dataset, showing results competitive with the state of the art.",['cs.CV']
Encoder-Decoder based CNN and Fully Connected CRFs for Remote Sensed Image Segmentation,"With the advancement of remote-sensed imaging large volumes of very high resolution land cover images can now be obtained. Automation of object recognition in these 2D images, however, is still a key issue. High intra-class variance and low inter-class variance in Very High Resolution (VHR) images hamper the accuracy of prediction in object recognition tasks. Most successful techniques in various computer vision tasks recently are based on deep supervised learning. In this work, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on symmetric encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed for the 2D semantic segmentation of most common land cover object classes - impervious surface, buildings, low vegetation, trees and cars. Atrous convolutions are employed to have large receptive field in the proposed CNN model. Further, the CNN outputs are post-processed using Fully Connected Conditional Random Field (FCRF) model to refine the CNN pixel label predictions. The proposed CNN-FCRF model achieves an overall accuracy of 90.5% on the ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
End-to-End Deep Convolutional Active Contours for Image Segmentation,"The Active Contour Model (ACM) is a standard image analysis technique whose numerous variants have attracted an enormous amount of research attention across multiple fields. Incorrectly, however, the ACM's differential-equation-based formulation and prototypical dependence on user initialization have been regarded as being largely incompatible with the recently popular deep learning approaches to image segmentation. This paper introduces the first tight unification of these two paradigms. In particular, we devise Deep Convolutional Active Contours (DCAC), a truly end-to-end trainable image segmentation framework comprising a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an ACM with learnable parameters. The ACM's Eulerian energy functional includes per-pixel parameter maps predicted by the backbone CNN, which also initializes the ACM. Importantly, both the CNN and ACM components are fully implemented in TensorFlow, and the entire DCAC architecture is end-to-end automatically differentiable and backpropagation trainable without user intervention. As a challenging test case, we tackle the problem of building instance segmentation in aerial images and evaluate DCAC on two publicly available datasets, Vaihingen and Bing Huts. Our reseults demonstrate that, for building segmentation, the DCAC establishes a new state-of-the-art performance by a wide margin.",['cs.CV']
CNN-based Semantic Segmentation using Level Set Loss,"Thesedays, Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in semantic segmentation. However, since CNN-based segmentation networks produce low-resolution outputs with rich semantic information, it is inevitable that spatial details (e.g., small bjects and fine boundary information) of segmentation results will be lost. To address this problem, motivated by a variational approach to image segmentation (i.e., level set theory), we propose a novel loss function called the level set loss which is designed to refine spatial details of segmentation results. To deal with multiple classes in an image, we first decompose the ground truth into binary images. Note that each binary image consists of background and regions belonging to a class. Then we convert level set functions into class probability maps and calculate the energy for each class. The network is trained to minimize the weighted sum of the level set loss and the cross-entropy loss. The proposed level set loss improves the spatial details of segmentation results in a time and memory efficient way. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed loss function achieves better performance than previous approaches.",['cs.CV']
SynSeg-Net: Synthetic Segmentation Without Target Modality Ground Truth,"A key limitation of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based image segmentation methods is the lack of generalizability. Manually traced training images are typically required when segmenting organs in a new imaging modality or from distinct disease cohort. The manual efforts can be alleviated if the manually traced images in one imaging modality (e.g., MRI) are able to train a segmentation network for another imaging modality (e.g., CT). In this paper, we propose an end-to-end synthetic segmentation network (SynSeg-Net) to train a segmentation network for a target imaging modality without having manual labels. SynSeg-Net is trained by using (1) unpaired intensity images from source and target modalities, and (2) manual labels only from source modality. SynSeg-Net is enabled by the recent advances of cycle generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) and DCNN. We evaluate the performance of the SynSeg-Net on two experiments: (1) MRI to CT splenomegaly synthetic segmentation for abdominal images, and (2) CT to MRI total intracranial volume synthetic segmentation (TICV) for brain images. The proposed end-to-end approach achieved superior performance to two stage methods. Moreover, the SynSeg-Net achieved comparable performance to the traditional segmentation network using target modality labels in certain scenarios. The source code of SynSeg-Net is publicly available (https://github.com/MASILab/SynSeg-Net).",['cs.CV']
Biomedical Image Segmentation by Retina-like Sequential Attention Mechanism Using Only A Few Training Images,"In this paper we propose a novel deep learning-based algorithm for biomedical image segmentation which uses a sequential attention mechanism able to shift the focus of attention across the image in a selective way, allowing subareas which are more difficult to classify to be processed at increased resolution. The spatial distribution of class information in each subarea is learned using a retina-like representation where resolution decreases with distance from the center of attention. The final segmentation is achieved by averaging class predictions over overlapping subareas, utilizing the power of ensemble learning to increase segmentation accuracy. Experimental results for semantic segmentation task for which only a few training images are available show that a CNN using the proposed method outperforms both a patch-based classification CNN and a fully convolutional-based method.","['cs.CV', 'cs.NE']"
Dual Adaptive Pyramid Network for Cross-Stain Histopathology Image Segmentation,"Supervised semantic segmentation normally assumes the test data being in a similar data domain as the training data. However, in practice, the domain mismatch between the training and unseen data could lead to a significant performance drop. Obtaining accurate pixel-wise label for images in different domains is tedious and labor intensive, especially for histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a dual adaptive pyramid network (DAPNet) for histopathological gland segmentation adapting from one stain domain to another. We tackle the domain adaptation problem on two levels: 1) the image-level considers the differences of image color and style; 2) the feature-level addresses the spatial inconsistency between two domains. The two components are implemented as domain classifiers with adversarial training. We evaluate our new approach using two gland segmentation datasets with H&E and DAB-H stains respectively. The extensive experiments and ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the domain adaptive segmentation task. We show that the proposed approach performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Neural Style Transfer Improves 3D Cardiovascular MR Image Segmentation on Inconsistent Data,"Three-dimensional medical image segmentation is one of the most important problems in medical image analysis and plays a key role in downstream diagnosis and treatment. Recent years, deep neural networks have made groundbreaking success in medical image segmentation problem. However, due to the high variance in instrumental parameters, experimental protocols, and subject appearances, the generalization of deep learning models is often hindered by the inconsistency in medical images generated by different machines and hospitals. In this work, we present StyleSegor, an efficient and easy-to-use strategy to alleviate this inconsistency issue. Specifically, neural style transfer algorithm is applied to unlabeled data in order to minimize the differences in image properties including brightness, contrast, texture, etc. between the labeled and unlabeled data. We also apply probabilistic adjustment on the network output and integrate multiple predictions through ensemble learning. On a publicly available whole heart segmentation benchmarking dataset from MICCAI HVSMR 2016 challenge, we have demonstrated an elevated dice accuracy surpassing current state-of-the-art method and notably, an improvement of the total score by 29.91\%. StyleSegor is thus corroborated to be an accurate tool for 3D whole heart segmentation especially on highly inconsistent data, and is available at https://github.com/horsepurve/StyleSegor.",['cs.CV']
Extremely Weak Supervised Image-to-Image Translation for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in generative models and adversarial training have led to a flourishing image-to-image (I2I) translation literature. The current I2I translation approaches require training images from the two domains that are either all paired (supervised) or all unpaired (unsupervised). In practice, obtaining paired training data in sufficient quantities is often very costly and cumbersome. Therefore solutions that employ unpaired data, while less accurate, are largely preferred. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between supervised and unsupervised I2I translation, with application to semantic image segmentation. We build upon pix2pix and CycleGAN, state-of-the-art seminal I2I translation techniques. We propose a method to select (very few) paired training samples and achieve significant improvements in both supervised and unsupervised I2I translation settings over random selection. Further, we boost the performance by incorporating both (selected) paired and unpaired samples in the training process. Our experiments show that an extremely weak supervised I2I translation solution using only one paired training sample can achieve a quantitative performance much better than the unsupervised CycleGAN model, and comparable to that of the supervised pix2pix model trained on thousands of pairs.",['cs.CV']
Exploiting Temporality for Semi-Supervised Video Segmentation,"In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in supervised image segmentation. Video segmentation is less explored, despite the temporal dimension being highly informative. Semantic labels, e.g. that cannot be accurately detected in the current frame, may be inferred by incorporating information from previous frames. However, video segmentation is challenging due to the amount of data that needs to be processed and, more importantly, the cost involved in obtaining ground truth annotations for each frame. In this paper, we tackle the issue of label scarcity by using consecutive frames of a video, where only one frame is annotated. We propose a deep, end-to-end trainable model which leverages temporal information in order to make use of easy to acquire unlabeled data. Our network architecture relies on a novel interconnection of two components: a fully convolutional network to model spatial information and temporal units that are employed at intermediate levels of the convolutional network in order to propagate information through time. The main contribution of this work is the guidance of the temporal signal through the network. We show that only placing a temporal module between the encoder and decoder is suboptimal (baseline). Our extensive experiments on the CityScapes dataset indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled temporal frames and significantly outperform both the frame-by-frame image segmentation and the baseline approach.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Don't ignore Dropout in Fully Convolutional Networks,"Data for Image segmentation models can be costly to obtain due to the precision required by human annotators. We run a series of experiments showing the effect of different kinds of Dropout training on the DeepLabv3+ Image segmentation model when trained using a small dataset. We find that when appropriate forms of Dropout are applied in the right place in the model architecture that non-insignificant improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score can be observed. In our best case, we find that applying Dropout scheduling in conjunction with SpatialDropout improves baseline mIoU from 0.49 to 0.59. This result shows that even where a model architecture makes extensive use of Batch Normalization, Dropout can still be an effective way of improving performance in low data situations.",['cs.CV']
Weakly Supervised Segmentation by A Deep Geodesic Prior,"The performance of the state-of-the-art image segmentation methods heavily relies on the high-quality annotations, which are not easily affordable, particularly for medical data. To alleviate this limitation, in this study, we propose a weakly supervised image segmentation method based on a deep geodesic prior. We hypothesize that integration of this prior information can reduce the adverse effects of weak labels in segmentation accuracy. Our proposed algorithm is based on a prior information, extracted from an auto-encoder, trained to map objects geodesic maps to their corresponding binary maps. The obtained information is then used as an extra term in the loss function of the segmentor. In order to show efficacy of the proposed strategy, we have experimented segmentation of cardiac substructures with clean and two levels of noisy labels (L1, L2). Our experiments showed that the proposed algorithm boosted the performance of baseline deep learning-based segmentation for both clean and noisy labels by 4.4%, 4.6%(L1), and 6.3%(L2) in dice score, respectively. We also showed that the proposed method was more robust in the presence of high-level noise due to the existence of shape priors.","['stat.ML', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Boundary-weighted Domain Adaptive Neural Network for Prostate MR Image Segmentation,"Accurate segmentation of the prostate from magnetic resonance (MR) images provides useful information for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images still faces several challenges. For instance, a lack of clear edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size, shape and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even further complicated. With deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emerging as commonly used methods for medical image segmentation, the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced that ever before. Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of deep learning, lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BOWDA-Net). To make the network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation, a boundary-weighted segmentation loss (BWL) is proposed. Furthermore, an advanced boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the problem of small medical imaging datasets. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available MICCAI 2012 Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is more sensitive to boundary information and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
SFSegNet: Parse Freehand Sketches using Deep Fully Convolutional Networks,"Parsing sketches via semantic segmentation is attractive but challenging, because (i) free-hand drawings are abstract with large variances in depicting objects due to different drawing styles and skills; (ii) distorting lines drawn on the touchpad make sketches more difficult to be recognized; (iii) the high-performance image segmentation via deep learning technologies needs enormous annotated sketch datasets during the training stage. In this paper, we propose a Sketch-target deep FCN Segmentation Network(SFSegNet) for automatic free-hand sketch segmentation, labeling each sketch in a single object with multiple parts. SFSegNet has an end-to-end network process between the input sketches and the segmentation results, composed of 2 parts: (i) a modified deep Fully Convolutional Network(FCN) using a reweighting strategy to ignore background pixels and classify which part each pixel belongs to; (ii) affine transform encoders that attempt to canonicalize the shaking strokes. We train our network with the dataset that consists of 10,000 annotated sketches, to find an extensively applicable model to segment stokes semantically in one ground truth. Extensive experiments are carried out and segmentation results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art networks.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
DDSL: Deep Differentiable Simplex Layer for Learning Geometric Signals,"We present a Deep Differentiable Simplex Layer (DDSL) for neural networks for geometric deep learning. The DDSL is a differentiable layer compatible with deep neural networks for bridging simplex mesh-based geometry representations (point clouds, line mesh, triangular mesh, tetrahedral mesh) with raster images (e.g., 2D/3D grids). The DDSL uses Non-Uniform Fourier Transform (NUFT) to perform differentiable, efficient, anti-aliased rasterization of simplex-based signals. We present a complete theoretical framework for the process as well as an efficient backpropagation algorithm. Compared to previous differentiable renderers and rasterizers, the DDSL generalizes to arbitrary simplex degrees and dimensions. In particular, we explore its applications to 2D shapes and illustrate two applications of this method: (1) mesh editing and optimization guided by neural network outputs, and (2) using DDSL for a differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training of polygon generators. We are able to validate the effectiveness of gradient-based shape optimization with the example of airfoil optimization, and using the differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training, we surpass state of the art for polygonal image segmentation given ground-truth bounding boxes.",['cs.CV']

Leveraging Domain Knowledge to Improve Microscopy Image Segmentation with Lifted Multicuts,"The throughput of electron microscopes has increased significantly in recent years, enabling detailed analysis of cell morphology and ultrastructure. Analysis of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution remains the flagship target of this technique, but applications to cell and developmental biology are also starting to emerge at scale. The amount of data acquired in such studies makes manual instance segmentation, a fundamental step in many analysis pipelines, impossible. While automatic segmentation approaches have improved significantly thanks to the adoption of convolutional neural networks, their accuracy still lags behind human annotations and requires additional manual proof-reading. A major hindrance to further improvements is the limited field of view of the segmentation networks preventing them from exploiting the expected cell morphology or other prior biological knowledge which humans use to inform their segmentation decisions. In this contribution, we show how such domain-specific information can be leveraged by expressing it as long-range interactions in a graph partitioning problem known as the lifted multicut problem. Using this formulation, we demonstrate significant improvement in segmentation accuracy for three challenging EM segmentation problems from neuroscience and cell biology.",['cs.CV']
A novel framework of the fuzzy c-means distances problem based weighted distance,"Clustering is one of the major roles in data mining that is widely application in pattern recognition and image segmentation. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is the most used clustering algorithm that proven efficient, fast and easy to implement, however, FCM uses the Euclidean distance that often leads to clustering errors, especially when handling multidimensional and noisy data. In the last few years, many distances metric have been proposed by researchers to improve the performance of the FCM algorithms, and the majority of researchers propose weighted distance. In this paper, we proposed Canberra Weighted Distance to improved performance of the FCM algorithm. The experimental result using the UCI data set show the proposed method is superior to the original method and other clustering methods.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Multi-Task Attention-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,"We propose a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method that simultaneously optimizes a supervised segmentation and an unsupervised reconstruction objectives. The reconstruction objective uses an attention mechanism that separates the reconstruction of image areas corresponding to different classes. The proposed approach was evaluated on two applications: brain tumor and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. Our method, trained on unlabeled and a small number of labeled images, outperformed supervised CNNs trained with the same number of images and CNNs pre-trained on unlabeled data. In ablation experiments, we observed that the proposed attention mechanism substantially improves segmentation performance. We explore two multi-task training strategies: joint training and alternating training. Alternating training requires fewer hyperparameters and achieves a better, more stable performance than joint training. Finally, we analyze the features learned by different methods and find that the attention mechanism helps to learn more discriminative features in the deeper layers of encoders.",['cs.CV']
Boundary and Entropy-driven Adversarial Learning for Fundus Image Segmentation,"Accurate segmentation of the optic disc (OD) and cup (OC)in fundus images from different datasets is critical for glaucoma disease screening. The cross-domain discrepancy (domain shift) hinders the generalization of deep neural networks to work on different domain datasets.In this work, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation framework,called Boundary and Entropy-driven Adversarial Learning (BEAL), to improve the OD and OC segmentation performance, especially on the ambiguous boundary regions. In particular, our proposed BEAL frame-work utilizes the adversarial learning to encourage the boundary prediction and mask probability entropy map (uncertainty map) of the target domain to be similar to the source ones, generating more accurate boundaries and suppressing the high uncertainty predictions of OD and OC segmentation. We evaluate the proposed BEAL framework on two public retinal fundus image datasets (Drishti-GS and RIM-ONE-r3), and the experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/EmmaW8/BEAL.",['cs.CV']
DeepAtlas: Joint Semi-Supervised Learning of Image Registration and Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are state-of-the-art for semantic image segmentation, but typically require many labeled training samples. Obtaining 3D segmentations of medical images for supervised training is difficult and labor intensive. Motivated by classical approaches for joint segmentation and registration we therefore propose a deep learning framework that jointly learns networks for image registration and image segmentation. In contrast to previous work on deep unsupervised image registration, which showed the benefit of weak supervision via image segmentations, our approach can use existing segmentations when available and computes them via the segmentation network otherwise, thereby providing the same registration benefit. Conversely, segmentation network training benefits from the registration, which essentially provides a realistic form of data augmentation. Experiments on knee and brain 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images show that our approach achieves large simultaneous improvements of segmentation and registration accuracy (over independently trained networks) and allows training high-quality models with very limited training data. Specifically, in a one-shot-scenario (with only one manually labeled image) our approach increases Dice scores (%) over an unsupervised registration network by 2.7 and 1.8 on the knee and brain images respectively.",['cs.CV']
Incremental Class Discovery for Semantic Segmentation with RGBD Sensing,"This work addresses the task of open world semantic segmentation using RGBD sensing to discover new semantic classes over time. Although there are many types of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a closed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of object classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method that incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed system first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric information, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented dense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key component of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by identifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use of coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than traditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to semi-real-time performance at {10.7}Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D map at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and unseen classes. We also show the quantitative comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods, the processing time of each step, and the influences of each component.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
An Efficient 3D CNN for Action/Object Segmentation in Video,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image segmentation has made great progress in recent years. However, video object segmentation remains a challenging task due to its high computational complexity. Most of the previous methods employ a two-stream CNN framework to handle spatial and motion features separately. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end encoder-decoder style 3D CNN to aggregate spatial and temporal information simultaneously for video object segmentation. To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable convolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically reduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover, we also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra classifier to predict the action label for actors in videos. Extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach for action and object segmentation compared to the state-of-the-art.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Introduction to Camera Pose Estimation with Deep Learning,"Over the last two decades, deep learning has transformed the field of computer vision. Deep convolutional networks were successfully applied to learn different vision tasks such as image classification, image segmentation, object detection and many more. By transferring the knowledge learned by deep models on large generic datasets, researchers were further able to create fine-tuned models for other more specific tasks. Recently this idea was applied for regressing the absolute camera pose from an RGB image. Although the resulting accuracy was sub-optimal, compared to classic feature-based solutions, this effort led to a surge of learning-based pose estimation methods. Here, we review deep learning approaches for camera pose estimation. We describe key methods in the field and identify trends aiming at improving the original deep pose regression solution. We further provide an extensive cross-comparison of existing learning-based pose estimators, together with practical notes on their execution for reproducibility purposes. Finally, we discuss emerging solutions and potential future research directions.",['cs.CV']
A Divide-and-Conquer Approach towards Understanding Deep Networks,"Deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success in various fields including medical image segmentation. However, they have long been criticized for being a black-box, in that interpretation, understanding and correcting architectures is difficult as there is no general theory for deep neural network design. Previously, precision learning was proposed to fuse deep architectures and traditional approaches. Deep networks constructed in this way benefit from the original known operator, have fewer parameters, and improved interpretability. However, they do not yield state-of-the-art performance in all applications. In this paper, we propose to analyze deep networks using known operators, by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to replace network components, whilst retaining its performance. The task of retinal vessel segmentation is investigated for this purpose. We start with a high-performance U-Net and show by step-by-step conversion that we are able to divide the network into modules of known operators. The results indicate that a combination of a trainable guided filter and a trainable version of the Frangi filter yields a performance at the level of U-Net (AUC 0.974 vs. 0.972) with a tremendous reduction in parameters (111,536 vs. 9,575). In addition, the trained layers can be mapped back into their original algorithmic interpretation and analyzed using standard tools of signal processing.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Deep Active Learning for Axon-Myelin Segmentation on Histology Data,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image processing, which recent breakthroughs in deep learning have allowed to improve. However, deep learning methods in general are not yet widely used in practice since they require large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly challenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce resource. Annotation efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since experts have to manually label images at pixel-level on samples usually containing many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology samples: neurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework for Deep Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies on the U-Net architecture and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which sample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty measure obtained by taking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme. Experiments were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to perform a myelin segmentation task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24 images were used, from different acquisition settings (Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that our method reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples to the initial training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby significantly reducing the annotation effort. We focused on a plausible scenario and showed evidence that this straightforward implementation achieves a high segmentation performance with very few labelled samples. We believe our framework may benefit any biomedical researcher willing to obtain fast and accurate image segmentation on their own dataset. The code is freely available at https://github.com/neuropoly/deep-active-learning.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Self-Supervised Learning for Cardiac MR Image Segmentation by Anatomical Position Prediction,"In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field of medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image features for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However, successfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually annotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available resources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised and self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention, which aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time avoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in which features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical positions. The anatomical positions serve as a supervisory signal and do not require extra manual annotation. We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task provides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised learning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or comparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting. When only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves the mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation, compared to the baseline U-net.",['cs.CV']
Semi-Bagging Based Deep Neural Architecture to Extract Text from High Entropy Images,"Extracting texts of various size and shape from images containing multiple objects is an important problem in many contexts, especially, in connection to e-commerce, augmented reality assistance system in natural scene, etc. The existing works (based on only CNN) often perform sub-optimally when the image contains regions of high entropy having multiple objects. This paper presents an end-to-end text detection strategy combining a segmentation algorithm and an ensemble of multiple text detectors of different types to detect text in every individual image segments independently. The proposed strategy involves a super-pixel based image segmenter which splits an image into multiple regions. A convolutional deep neural architecture is developed which works on each of the segments and detects texts of multiple shapes, sizes, and structures. It outperforms the competing methods in terms of coverage in detecting texts in images especially the ones where the text of various types and sizes are compacted in a small region along with various other objects. Furthermore, the proposed text detection method along with a text recognizer outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in extracting text from high entropy images. We validate the results on a dataset consisting of product images on an e-commerce website.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Consistent estimation of the max-flow problem: Towards unsupervised image segmentation,"Advances in the image-based diagnostics of complex biological and manufacturing processes have brought unsupervised image segmentation to the forefront of enabling automated, on the fly decision making. However, most existing unsupervised segmentation approaches are either computationally complex or require manual parameter selection (e.g., flow capacities in max-flow/min-cut segmentation). In this work, we present a fully unsupervised segmentation approach using a continuous max-flow formulation over the image domain while optimally estimating the flow parameters from the image characteristics. More specifically, we show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of the image labels can be formulated as a continuous max-flow problem given the flow capacities are known. The flow capacities are then iteratively obtained by employing a novel Markov random field prior over the image domain. We present theoretical results to establish the posterior consistency of the flow capacities. We compare the performance of our approach on two real-world case studies including brain tumor image segmentation and defect identification in additively manufactured components using electron microscopic images. Comparative results with several state-of-the-art supervised as well as unsupervised methods suggest that the present method performs statistically similar to the supervised methods, but results in more than 90% improvement in the Dice score when compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Learning of Image Dehazing Models for Segmentation Tasks,"To evaluate their performance, existing dehazing approaches generally rely on distance measures between the generated image and its corresponding ground truth. Despite its ability to produce visually good images, using pixel-based or even perceptual metrics do not guarantee, in general, that the produced image is fit for being used as input for low-level computer vision tasks such as segmentation. To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy conditions. Results obtained using the proposed technique are appealing, with a favorable comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when considering the performance of segmentation algorithms on the hazy images.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
Scalable Neural Architecture Search for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"In this paper, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework is proposed for 3D medical image segmentation, to automatically optimize a neural architecture from a large design space. Our NAS framework searches the structure of each layer including neural connectivities and operation types in both of the encoder and decoder. Since optimizing over a large discrete architecture space is difficult due to high-resolution 3D medical images, a novel stochastic sampling algorithm based on a continuous relaxation is also proposed for scalable gradient based optimization. On the 3D medical image segmentation tasks with a benchmark dataset, an automatically designed architecture by the proposed NAS framework outperforms the human-designed 3D U-Net, and moreover this optimized architecture is well suited to be transferred for different tasks.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
When Unseen Domain Generalization is Unnecessary? Rethinking Data Augmentation,"Recent advances in deep learning for medical image segmentation demonstrate expert-level accuracy. However, in clinically realistic environments, such methods have marginal performance due to differences in image domains, including different imaging protocols, device vendors and patient populations. Here we consider the problem of domain generalization, when a model is trained once, and its performance generalizes to unseen domains. Intuitively, within a specific medical imaging modality the domain differences are smaller relative to natural images domain variability. We rethink data augmentation for medical 3D images and propose a deep stacked transformations (DST) approach for domain generalization. Specifically, a series of n stacked transformations are applied to each image in each mini-batch during network training to account for the contribution of domain-specific shifts in medical images. We comprehensively evaluate our method on three tasks: segmentation of whole prostate from 3D MRI, left atrial from 3D MRI, and left ventricle from 3D ultrasound. We demonstrate that when trained on a small source dataset, (i) on average, DST models on unseen datasets degrade only by 11% (Dice score change), compared to the conventional augmentation (degrading 39%) and CycleGAN-based domain adaptation method (degrading 25%); (ii) when evaluation on the same domain, DST is also better albeit only marginally. (iii) When training on large-sized data, DST on unseen domains reaches performance of state-of-the-art fully supervised models. These findings establish a strong benchmark for the study of domain generalization in medical imaging, and can be generalized to the design of robust deep segmentation models for clinical deployment.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV']"
MAVNet: an Effective Semantic Segmentation Micro-Network for MAV-based Tasks,"Real-time semantic image segmentation on platforms subject to size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints is a key area of interest for air surveillance and inspection.

MAVNet, inspired by ERFNet, features 400 times fewer parameters and achieves comparable performance with some reference models in empirical experiments. Our model achieves a trade-off between speed and accuracy, achieving up to 48 FPS on an NVIDIA 1080Ti and 9 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier when processing high resolution imagery. Additionally, we provide two novel datasets that represent challenges in semantic segmentation for real-time MAV tracking and infrastructure inspection tasks and verify MAVNet on these datasets. Our algorithm and datasets are made publicly available.",['cs.CV']
Harvesting Information from Captions for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Since acquiring pixel-wise annotations for training convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation is time-consuming, weakly supervised approaches that only require class tags have been proposed. In this work, we propose another form of supervision, namely image captions as they can be found on the Internet. These captions have two advantages. They do not require additional curation as it is the case for the clean class tags used by current weakly supervised approaches and they provide textual context for the classes present in an image. To leverage such textual context, we deploy a multi-modal network that learns a joint embedding of the visual representation of the image and the textual representation of the caption. The network estimates text activation maps (TAMs) for class names as well as compound concepts, i.e. combinations of nouns and their attributes. The TAMs of compound concepts describing classes of interest substantially improve the quality of the estimated class activation maps which are then used to train a network for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset where it achieves state of the art results for weakly supervised image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Diversity in Machine Learning,"Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the machine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some directions in future work.",['cs.CV']
Indoor dense depth map at drone hovering,"Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) gained tremendous attention in recent years. Autonomous flight in indoor requires a dense depth map for navigable space detection which is the fundamental component for autonomous navigation. In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing dense depth while a drone is hovering (small camera motion) in indoor scenes using already estimated cameras and sparse point cloud obtained from a vSLAM. We start by segmenting the scene based on sudden depth variation using sparse 3D points and introduce a patch-based local plane fitting via energy minimization which combines photometric consistency and co-planarity with neighbouring patches. The method also combines a plane sweep technique for image segments having almost no sparse point for initialization. Experiments show, the proposed method produces better depth for indoor in artificial lighting condition, low-textured environment compared to earlier literature in small motion.",['cs.CV']
The iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) for image segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a novel iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) that is applicable to a range of variational models for image segmentation. A variational model usually minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity term and a regularization term. In the ICTM, the interface between two different segment domains is implicitly represented by their characteristic functions. The fidelity term is then usually written as a linear functional of the characteristic functions and the regularized term is approximated by a functional of characteristic functions in terms of heat kernel convolution. This allows us to design an iterative convolution-thresholding method to minimize the approximate energy. The method is simple, efficient and enjoys the energy-decaying property. Numerical experiments show that the method is easy to implement, robust and applicable to various image segmentation models.",['cs.CV']
XNet: A convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation for medical X-Ray image segmentation suitable for small datasets,"X-Ray image enhancement, along with many other medical image processing applications, requires the segmentation of images into bone, soft tissue, and open beam regions. We apply a machine learning approach to this problem, presenting an end-to-end solution which results in robust and efficient inference. Since medical institutions frequently do not have the resources to process and label the large quantity of X-Ray images usually needed for neural network training, we design an end-to-end solution for small datasets, while achieving state-of-the-art results. Our implementation produces an overall accuracy of 92%, F1 score of 0.92, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing classical image processing techniques, such as clustering and entropy based methods, while improving upon the output of existing neural networks used for segmentation in non-medical contexts.

A Distance Map Regularized CNN for Cardiac Cine MR Image Segmentation,"Cardiac image segmentation is a critical process for generating personalized models of the heart and for quantifying cardiac performance parameters. Several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been proposed to segment the heart chambers from cardiac cine MR images. Here we propose a multi-task learning (MTL)-based regularization framework for cardiac MR image segmentation. The network is trained to perform the main task of semantic segmentation, along with a simultaneous, auxiliary task of pixel-wise distance map regression. The proposed distance map regularizer is a decoder network added to the bottleneck layer of an existing CNN architecture, facilitating the network to learn robust global features. The regularizer block is removed after training, so that the original number of network parameters does not change. We show that the proposed regularization method improves both binary and multi-class segmentation performance over the corresponding state-of-the-art CNN architectures on two publicly available cardiac cine MRI datasets, obtaining average dice coefficient of 0.84$\pm$0.03 and 0.91$\pm$0.04, respectively. Furthermore, we also demonstrate improved generalization performance of the distance map regularized network on cross-dataset segmentation, showing as much as 42% improvement in myocardium Dice coefficient from 0.56$\pm$0.28 to 0.80$\pm$0.14.",['cs.CV']
Road Crack Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Adaptive Thresholding,"Crack is one of the most common road distresses which may pose road safety hazards. Generally, crack detection is performed by either certified inspectors or structural engineers. This task is, however, time-consuming, subjective and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel road crack detection algorithm based on deep learning and adaptive image segmentation. Firstly, a deep convolutional neural network is trained to determine whether an image contains cracks or not. The images containing cracks are then smoothed using bilateral filtering, which greatly minimizes the number of noisy pixels. Finally, we utilize an adaptive thresholding method to extract the cracks from road surface. The experimental results illustrate that our network can classify images with an accuracy of 99.92%, and the cracks can be successfully extracted from the images using our proposed thresholding algorithm.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.IV']"
Region homogeneity in the Logarithmic Image Processing framework: application to region growing algorithms,"In order to create an image segmentation method robust to lighting changes, two novel homogeneity criteria of an image region were studied. Both were defined using the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) framework whose laws model lighting changes. The first criterion estimates the LIP-additive homogeneity and is based on the LIP-additive law. It is theoretically insensitive to lighting changes caused by variations of the camera exposure-time or source intensity. The second, the LIP-multiplicative homogeneity criterion, is based on the LIP-multiplicative law and is insensitive to changes due to variations of the object thickness or opacity. Each criterion is then applied in Revol and Jourlin's (1997) region growing method which is based on the homogeneity of an image region. The region growing method becomes therefore robust to the lighting changes specific to each criterion. Experiments on simulated and on real images presenting lighting variations prove the robustness of the criteria to those variations. Compared to a state-of the art method based on the image component-tree, ours is more robust. These results open the way to numerous applications where the lighting is uncontrolled or partially controlled.",['cs.CV']
Adaptive Weighting Multi-Field-of-View CNN for Semantic Segmentation in Pathology,"Automated digital histopathology image segmentation is an important task to help pathologists diagnose tumors and cancer subtypes. For pathological diagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assumption is that the importance of the magnifications depends on the characteristics of the input image, such as cancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be useful for identifying the subtypes. It outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in experiments.",['cs.CV']
Interactive Full Image Segmentation by Considering All Regions Jointly,"We address interactive full image annotation, where the goal is to accurately segment all object and stuff regions in an image. We propose an interactive, scribble-based annotation framework which operates on the whole image to produce segmentations for all regions. This enables sharing scribble corrections across regions, and allows the annotator to focus on the largest errors made by the machine across the whole image. To realize this, we adapt Mask-RCNN into a fast interactive segmentation framework and introduce an instance-aware loss measured at the pixel-level in the full image canvas, which lets predictions for nearby regions properly compete for space. Finally, we compare to interactive single object segmentation on the COCO panoptic dataset. We demonstrate that our interactive full image segmentation approach leads to a 5% IoU gain, reaching 90% IoU at a budget of four extreme clicks and four corrective scribbles per region.",['cs.CV']
3D Quantum Cuts for Automatic Segmentation of Porous Media in Tomography Images,"Binary segmentation of volumetric images of porous media is a crucial step towards gaining a deeper understanding of the factors governing biogeochemical processes at minute scales. Contemporary work primarily revolves around primitive techniques based on global or local adaptive thresholding that have known common drawbacks in image segmentation. Moreover, absence of a unified benchmark prohibits quantitative evaluation, which further clouds the impact of existing methodologies. In this study, we tackle the issue on both fronts. Firstly, by drawing parallels with natural image segmentation, we propose a novel, and automatic segmentation technique, 3D Quantum Cuts (QCuts-3D) grounded on a state-of-the-art spectral clustering technique. Secondly, we curate and present a publicly available dataset of 68 multiphase volumetric images of porous media with diverse solid geometries, along with voxel-wise ground truth annotations for each constituting phase. We provide comparative evaluations between QCuts-3D and the current state-of-the-art over this dataset across a variety of evaluation metrics. The proposed systematic approach achieves a 26% increase in AUROC while achieving a substantial reduction of the computational complexity of the state-of-the-art competitors. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals that the proposed method exhibits significant robustness against the compositional variations of porous media.",['cs.CV']
Data augmentation using learned transformations for one-shot medical image segmentation,"Image segmentation is an important task in many medical applications. Methods based on convolutional neural networks attain state-of-the-art accuracy; however, they typically rely on supervised training with large labeled datasets. Labeling medical images requires significant expertise and time, and typical hand-tuned approaches for data augmentation fail to capture the complex variations in such images.   We present an automated data augmentation method for synthesizing labeled medical images. We demonstrate our method on the task of segmenting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Our method requires only a single segmented scan, and leverages other unlabeled scans in a semi-supervised approach. We learn a model of transformations from the images, and use the model along with the labeled example to synthesize additional labeled examples. Each transformation is comprised of a spatial deformation field and an intensity change, enabling the synthesis of complex effects such as variations in anatomy and image acquisition procedures. We show that training a supervised segmenter with these new examples provides significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for one-shot biomedical image segmentation.

Auto-DeepLab: Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has successfully identified neural network architectures that exceed human designed ones on large-scale image classification. In this paper, we study NAS for semantic image segmentation. Existing works often focus on searching the repeatable cell structure, while hand-designing the outer network structure that controls the spatial resolution changes. This choice simplifies the search space, but becomes increasingly problematic for dense image prediction which exhibits a lot more network level architectural variations. Therefore, we propose to search the network level structure in addition to the cell level structure, which forms a hierarchical architecture search space. We present a network level search space that includes many popular designs, and develop a formulation that allows efficient gradient-based architecture search (3 P100 GPU days on Cityscapes images). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the challenging Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets.

Few-shot brain segmentation from weakly labeled data with deep heteroscedastic multi-task networks,"In applications of supervised learning applied to medical image segmentation, the need for large amounts of labeled data typically goes unquestioned. In particular, in the case of brain anatomy segmentation, hundreds or thousands of weakly-labeled volumes are often used as training data. In this paper, we first observe that for many brain structures, a small number of training examples, (n=9), weakly labeled using Freesurfer 6.0, plus simple data augmentation, suffice as training data to achieve high performance, achieving an overall mean Dice coefficient of $0.84 \pm 0.12$ compared to Freesurfer over 28 brain structures in T1-weighted images of $\approx 4000$ 9-10 year-olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We then examine two varieties of heteroscedastic network as a method for improving classification results. An existing proposal by Kendall and Gal, which uses Monte-Carlo inference to learn to predict the variance of each prediction, yields an overall mean Dice of $0.85 \pm 0.14$ and showed statistically significant improvements over 25 brain structures. Meanwhile a novel heteroscedastic network which directly learns the probability that an example has been mislabeled yielded an overall mean Dice of $0.87 \pm 0.11$ and showed statistically significant improvements over all but one of the brain structures considered. The loss function associated to this network can be interpreted as performing a form of learned label smoothing, where labels are only smoothed where they are judged to be uncertain.","['cs.LG', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Graph Cut Segmentation Methods Revisited with a Quantum Algorithm,"The design and performance of computer vision algorithms are greatly influenced by the hardware on which they are implemented. CPUs, multi-core CPUs, FPGAs and GPUs have inspired new algorithms and enabled existing ideas to be realized. This is notably the case with GPUs, which has significantly changed the landscape of computer vision research through deep learning. As the end of Moores law approaches, researchers and hardware manufacturers are exploring alternative hardware computing paradigms. Quantum computers are a very promising alternative and offer polynomial or even exponential speed-ups over conventional computing for some problems. This paper presents a novel approach to image segmentation that uses new quantum computing hardware. Segmentation is formulated as a graph cut problem that can be mapped to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). This algorithm can be implemented on current and near-term quantum computers. Encouraging results are presented on artificial and medical imaging data. This represents an important, practical step towards leveraging quantum computers for computer vision.",['cs.CV']
Feature Fusion Encoder Decoder Network For Automatic Liver Lesion Segmentation,"Liver lesion segmentation is a difficult yet critical task for medical image analysis. Recently, deep learning based image segmentation methods have achieved promising performance, which can be divided into three categories: 2D, 2.5D and 3D, based on the dimensionality of the models. However, 2.5D and 3D methods can have very high complexity and 2D methods may not perform satisfactorily. To obtain competitive performance with low complexity, in this paper, we propose a Feature-fusion Encoder-Decoder Network (FED-Net) based 2D segmentation model to tackle the challenging problem of liver lesion segmentation from CT images. Our feature fusion method is based on the attention mechanism, which fuses high-level features carrying semantic information with low-level features having image details. Additionally, to compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, a dense upsampling convolution and a residual convolutional structure are proposed. We tested our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and achieved competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Scene Understanding for Autonomous Manipulation with Deep Learning,"Over the past few years, deep learning techniques have achieved tremendous success in many visual understanding tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and caption generation. Despite this thriving in computer vision and natural language processing, deep learning has not yet shown significant impact in robotics. Due to the gap between theory and application, there are many challenges when applying the results of deep learning to the real robotic systems. In this study, our long-term goal is to bridge the gap between computer vision and robotics by developing visual methods that can be used in real robots. In particular, this work tackles two fundamental visual problems for autonomous robotic manipulation: affordance detection and fine-grained action understanding. Theoretically, we propose different deep architectures to further improves the state of the art in each problem. Empirically, we show that the outcomes of our proposed methods can be applied in real robots and allow them to perform useful manipulation tasks.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks,"In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.   The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters",['cs.CV']
Learning Disentangled Representations of Satellite Image Time Series,"In this paper, we investigate how to learn a suitable representation of satellite image time series in an unsupervised manner by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data. Additionally , we aim to disentangle the representation of time series into two representations: a shared representation that captures the common information between the images of a time series and an exclusive representation that contains the specific information of each image of the time series. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines a novel component called cross-domain autoencoders with the variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative ad-versarial network (GAN) methods. In order to learn disentangled representations of time series, our model learns the multimodal image-to-image translation task. We train our model using satellite image time series from the Sentinel-2 mission. Several experiments are carried out to evaluate the obtained representations. We show that these disentangled representations can be very useful to perform multiple tasks such as image classification, image retrieval, image segmentation and change detection.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Efficient Smoothing of Dilated Convolutions for Image Segmentation,"Dilated Convolutions have been shown to be highly useful for the task of image segmentation. By introducing gaps into convolutional filters, they enable the use of larger receptive fields without increasing the original kernel size. Even though this allows for the inexpensive capturing of features at different scales, the structure of the dilated convolutional filter leads to a loss of information. We hypothesise that inexpensive modifications to Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks, such as additional averaging layers, could overcome this limitation. In this project we test this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of these modifications for a state-of-the art image segmentation system and compare them to existing approaches with the same objective. Our experiments show that our proposed methods improve the performance of dilated convolutions for image segmentation. Crucially, our modifications achieve these results at a much lower computational cost than previous smoothing approaches.",['cs.CV']
SuperPatchMatch: an Algorithm for Robust Correspondences using Superpixel Patches,"Superpixels have become very popular in many computer vision applications. Nevertheless, they remain underexploited since the superpixel decomposition may produce irregular and non stable segmentation results due to the dependency to the image content. In this paper, we first introduce a novel structure, a superpixel-based patch, called SuperPatch. The proposed structure, based on superpixel neighborhood, leads to a robust descriptor since spatial information is naturally included. The generalization of the PatchMatch method to SuperPatches, named SuperPatchMatch, is introduced. Finally, we propose a framework to perform fast segmentation and labeling from an image database, and demonstrate the potential of our approach since we outperform, in terms of computational cost and accuracy, the results of state-of-the-art methods on both face labeling and medical image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Nonlinear Markov Random Fields Learned via Backpropagation,"Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently dominate competitions on image segmentation, for neuroimaging analysis tasks, more classical generative approaches based on mixture models are still used in practice to parcellate brains. To bridge the gap between the two, in this paper we propose a marriage between a probabilistic generative model, which has been shown to be robust to variability among magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired via different imaging protocols, and a CNN. The link is in the prior distribution over the unknown tissue classes, which are classically modelled using a Markov random field. In this work we model the interactions among neighbouring pixels by a type of recurrent CNN, which can encode more complex spatial interactions. We validate our proposed model on publicly available MR data, from different centres, and show that it generalises across imaging protocols. This result demonstrates a successful and principled inclusion of a CNN in a generative model, which in turn could be adapted by any probabilistic generative approach for image segmentation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Exploit fully automatic low-level segmented PET data for training high-level deep learning algorithms for the corresponding CT data,"We present an approach for fully automatic urinary bladder segmentation in CT images with artificial neural networks in this study. Automatic medical image analysis has become an invaluable tool in the different treatment stages of diseases. Especially medical image segmentation plays a vital role, since segmentation is often the initial step in an image analysis pipeline. Since deep neural networks have made a large impact on the field of image processing in the past years, we use two different deep learning architectures to segment the urinary bladder. Both of these architectures are based on pre-trained classification networks that are adapted to perform semantic segmentation. Since deep neural networks require a large amount of training data, specifically images and corresponding ground truth labels, we furthermore propose a method to generate such a suitable training data set from Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography image data. This is done by applying thresholding to the Positron Emission Tomography data for obtaining a ground truth and by utilizing data augmentation to enlarge the dataset. In this study, we discuss the influence of data augmentation on the segmentation results, and compare and evaluate the proposed architectures in terms of qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance. The results presented in this study allow concluding that deep neural networks can be considered a promising approach to segment the urinary bladder in CT images.",['cs.CV']
CE-Net: Context Encoder Network for 2D Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is an important step in medical image analysis. With the rapid development of convolutional neural network in image processing, deep learning has been used for medical image segmentation, such as optic disc segmentation, blood vessel detection, lung segmentation, cell segmentation, etc. Previously, U-net based approaches have been proposed. However, the consecutive pooling and strided convolutional operations lead to the loss of some spatial information. In this paper, we propose a context encoder network (referred to as CE-Net) to capture more high-level information and preserve spatial information for 2D medical image segmentation. CE-Net mainly contains three major components: a feature encoder module, a context extractor and a feature decoder module. We use pretrained ResNet block as the fixed feature extractor. The context extractor module is formed by a newly proposed dense atrous convolution (DAC) block and residual multi-kernel pooling (RMP) block. We applied the proposed CE-Net to different 2D medical image segmentation tasks. Comprehensive results show that the proposed method outperforms the original U-Net method and other state-of-the-art methods for optic disc segmentation, vessel detection, lung segmentation, cell contour segmentation and retinal optical coherence tomography layer segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Mixture Modeling of Global Shape Priors and Autoencoding Local Intensity Priors for Left Atrium Segmentation,"Difficult image segmentation problems, for instance left atrium MRI, can be addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
FickleNet: Weakly and Semi-supervised Semantic Image Segmentation using Stochastic Inference,"The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level annotations. Most methods based on image-level annotations use localization maps obtained from the classifier, but these only focus on the small discriminative parts of objects and do not capture precise boundaries. FickleNet explores diverse combinations of locations on feature maps created by generic deep neural networks. It selects hidden units randomly and then uses them to obtain activation scores for image classification. FickleNet implicitly learns the coherence of each location in the feature maps, resulting in a localization map which identifies both discriminative and other parts of objects. The ensemble effects are obtained from a single network by selecting random hidden unit pairs, which means that a variety of localization maps are generated from a single image. Our approach does not require any additional training steps and only adds a simple layer to a standard convolutional neural network; nevertheless it outperforms recent comparable techniques on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised settings.",['cs.CV']
"Class-independent sequential full image segmentation, using a convolutional net that finds a segment within an attention region, given a pointer pixel within this segment","This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an image segment, given a pixel within this segment region. The net receives an image, a point in the image and a region of interest (RoI ) mask. The net output is a binary mask of the segment in which the point is located. The region where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask. Full image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially, region-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single segmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image segmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in the training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things) and non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer pixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that covers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky region, the net returns the region of the sky in the image. This is true even if no example for sky or person appeared in the training set. The net was tested and trained on the COCO panoptic dataset and achieved 67% IOU for segmentation of familiar classes (that were part of the net training set) and 53% IOU for segmentation of unfamiliar classes (that were not included in the training).",['cs.CV']
3D RoI-aware U-Net for Accurate and Efficient Colorectal Tumor Segmentation,"Segmentation of colorectal cancerous regions from 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a crucial procedure for radiotherapy which conventionally requires accurate delineation of tumour boundaries at an expense of labor, time and reproducibility. While deep learning based methods serve good baselines in 3D image segmentation tasks, small applicable patch size limits effective receptive field and degrades segmentation performance. In addition, Regions of interest (RoIs) localization from large whole volume 3D images serves as a preceding operation that brings about multiple benefits in terms of speed, target completeness, reduction of false positives. Distinct from sliding window or non-joint localization-segmentation based models, we propose a novel multitask framework referred to as 3D RoI-aware U-Net (3D RU-Net), for RoI localization and in-region segmentation where the two tasks share one backbone encoder network. With the region proposals from the encoder, we crop multi-level RoI in-region features from the encoder to form a GPU memory-efficient decoder for detailpreserving segmentation and therefore enlarged applicable volume size and effective receptive field. To effectively train the model, we designed a Dice formulated loss function for the global-to-local multi-task learning procedure. Based on the efficiency gains, we went on to ensemble models with different receptive fields to achieve even higher performance costing minor extra computational expensiveness. Extensive experiments were conducted on 64 cancerous cases with a four-fold cross-validation, and the results showed significant superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency over conventional frameworks. In conclusion, the proposed method has a huge potential for extension to other 3D object segmentation tasks from medical images due to its inherent generalizability. The code for the proposed method is publicly available.",['cs.CV']
Fast-SCNN: Fast Semantic Segmentation Network,"The encoder-decoder framework is state-of-the-art for offline semantic image segmentation. Since the rise in autonomous systems, real-time computation is increasingly desirable. In this paper, we introduce fast segmentation convolutional neural network (Fast-SCNN), an above real-time semantic segmentation model on high resolution image data (1024x2048px) suited to efficient computation on embedded devices with low memory. Building on existing two-branch methods for fast segmentation, we introduce our `learning to downsample' module which computes low-level features for multiple resolution branches simultaneously. Our network combines spatial detail at high resolution with deep features extracted at lower resolution, yielding an accuracy of 68.0% mean intersection over union at 123.5 frames per second on Cityscapes. We also show that large scale pre-training is unnecessary. We thoroughly validate our metric in experiments with ImageNet pre-training and the coarse labeled data of Cityscapes. Finally, we show even faster computation with competitive results on subsampled inputs, without any network modifications.",['cs.CV']
MultiResUNet : Rethinking the U-Net Architecture for Multimodal Biomedical Image Segmentation,"In recent years Deep Learning has brought about a breakthrough in Medical Image Segmentation. U-Net is the most prominent deep network in this regard, which has been the most popular architecture in the medical imaging community. Despite outstanding overall performance in segmenting multimodal medical images, from extensive experimentations on challenging datasets, we found out that the classical U-Net architecture seems to be lacking in certain aspects. Therefore, we propose some modifications to improve upon the already state-of-the-art U-Net model. Hence, following the modifications we develop a novel architecture MultiResUNet as the potential successor to the successful U-Net architecture. We have compared our proposed architecture MultiResUNet with the classical U-Net on a vast repertoire of multimodal medical images. Albeit slight improvements in the cases of ideal images, a remarkable gain in performance has been attained for challenging images. We have evaluated our model on five different datasets, each with their own unique challenges, and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 10.15%, 5.07%, 2.63%, 1.41%, and 0.62% respectively.",['cs.CV']
Learning to segment with image-level supervision,"Deep convolutional networks have achieved the state-of-the-art for semantic image segmentation tasks. However, training these networks requires access to densely labeled images, which are known to be very expensive to obtain. On the other hand, the web provides an almost unlimited source of images annotated at the image level. How can one utilize this much larger weakly annotated set for tasks that require dense labeling? Prior work often relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding boxes etc., to address this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a model that generates auxiliary labels for each image, while simultaneously forcing the output of the CNN to satisfy the mean-field constraints imposed by a conditional random field. We show that one can enforce the CRF constraints by forcing the distribution at each pixel to be close to the distribution of its neighbors. This is in stark contrast with methods that compute a recursive expansion of the mean-field distribution using a recurrent architecture and train the resultant distribution. Instead, the proposed model adds an extra loss term to the output of the CNN, and hence, is faster than recursive implementations. We achieve the state-of-the-art for weakly supervised semantic image segmentation on VOC 2012 dataset, assuming no manually labeled pixel level information is available. Furthermore, the incorporation of conditional random fields in CNN incurs little extra time during training.",['cs.CV']
Instance Segmentation as Image Segmentation Annotation,"The instance segmentation problem intends to precisely detect and delineate objects in images. Most of the current solutions rely on deep convolutional neural networks but despite this fact proposed solutions are very diverse. Some solutions approach the problem as a network problem, where they use several networks or specialize a single network to solve several tasks. A different approach tries to solve the problem as an annotation problem, where the instance information is encoded in a mathematical representation. This work proposes a solution based in the DCME technique to solve the instance segmentation with a single segmentation network. Different from others, the segmentation network decoder is not specialized in a multi-task network. Instead, the network encoder is repurposed to classify image objects, reducing the computational cost of the solution.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Learning Metric Graphs for Neuron Segmentation In Electron Microscopy Images,"In the deep metric learning approach to image segmentation, a convolutional net densely generates feature vectors at the pixels of an image. Pairs of feature vectors are trained to be similar or different, depending on whether the corresponding pixels belong to same or different ground truth segments. To segment a new image, the feature vectors are computed and clustered. Both empirically and theoretically, it is unclear whether or when deep metric learning is superior to the more conventional approach of directly predicting an affinity graph with a convolutional net. We compare the two approaches using brain images from serial section electron microscopy images, which constitute an especially challenging example of instance segmentation. We first show that seed-based postprocessing of the feature vectors, as originally proposed, produces inferior accuracy because it is difficult for the convolutional net to predict feature vectors that remain uniform across large objects. Then we consider postprocessing by thresholding a nearest neighbor graph followed by connected components. In this case, segmentations from a ""metric graph"" turn out to be competitive or even superior to segmentations from a directly predicted affinity graph. To explain these findings theoretically, we invoke the property that the metric function satisfies the triangle inequality. Then we show with an example where this constraint suppresses noise, causing connected components to more robustly segment a metric graph than an unconstrained affinity graph.",['cs.CV']
Aleatoric uncertainty estimation with test-time augmentation for medical image segmentation with convolutional neural networks,"Despite the state-of-the-art performance for medical image segmentation, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have rarely provided uncertainty estimations regarding their segmentation outputs, e.g., model (epistemic) and image-based (aleatoric) uncertainties. In this work, we analyze these different types of uncertainties for CNN-based 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. We additionally propose a test-time augmentation-based aleatoric uncertainty to analyze the effect of different transformations of the input image on the segmentation output. Test-time augmentation has been previously used to improve segmentation accuracy, yet not been formulated in a consistent mathematical framework. Hence, we also propose a theoretical formulation of test-time augmentation, where a distribution of the prediction is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation with prior distributions of parameters in an image acquisition model that involves image transformations and noise. We compare and combine our proposed aleatoric uncertainty with model uncertainty. Experiments with segmentation of fetal brains and brain tumors from 2D and 3D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) showed that 1) the test-time augmentation-based aleatoric uncertainty provides a better uncertainty estimation than calculating the test-time dropout-based model uncertainty alone and helps to reduce overconfident incorrect predictions, and 2) our test-time augmentation outperforms a single-prediction baseline and dropout-based multiple predictions.",['cs.CV']
Explicit topological priors for deep-learning based image segmentation using persistent homology,"We present a novel method to explicitly incorporate topological prior knowledge into deep learning based segmentation, which is, to our knowledge, the first work to do so. Our method uses the concept of persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to capture high-level topological characteristics of segmentation results in a way which is differentiable with respect to the pixelwise probability of being assigned to a given class. The topological prior knowledge consists of the sequence of desired Betti numbers of the segmentation. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate our approach by applying it to the problem of left-ventricle segmentation of cardiac MR images of 500 subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, where we show that it improves segmentation performance in terms of topological correctness without sacrificing pixelwise accuracy.",['cs.CV']
Automated Quality Control in Image Segmentation: Application to the UK Biobank Cardiac MR Imaging Study,"Background: The trend towards large-scale studies including population imaging poses new challenges in terms of quality control (QC). This is a particular issue when automatic processing tools, e.g. image segmentation methods, are employed to derive quantitative measures or biomarkers for later analyses. Manual inspection and visual QC of each segmentation isn't feasible at large scale. However, it's important to be able to automatically detect when a segmentation method fails so as to avoid inclusion of wrong measurements into subsequent analyses which could lead to incorrect conclusions. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we explore an approach for predicting segmentation quality based on Reverse Classification Accuracy, which enables us to discriminate between successful and failed segmentations on a per-cases basis. We validate this approach on a new, large-scale manually-annotated set of 4,800 cardiac magnetic resonance scans. We then apply our method to a large cohort of 7,250 cardiac MRI on which we have performed manual QC. Results: We report results used for predicting segmentation quality metrics including Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and surface-distance measures. As initial validation, we present data for 400 scans demonstrating 99% accuracy for classifying low and high quality segmentations using predicted DSC scores. As further validation we show high correlation between real and predicted scores and 95% classification accuracy on 4,800 scans for which manual segmentations were available. We mimic real-world application of the method on 7,250 cardiac MRI where we show good agreement between predicted quality metrics and manual visual QC scores. Conclusions: We show that RCA has the potential for accurate and fully automatic segmentation QC on a per-case basis in the context of large-scale population imaging as in the UK Biobank Imaging Study.",['cs.CV']
Unsupervised Automated Event Detection using an Iterative Clustering based Segmentation Approach,"A class of vision problems, less commonly studied, consists of detecting objects in imagery obtained from physics-based experiments. These objects can span in 4D (x, y, z, t) and are visible as disturbances (caused due to physical phenomena) in the image with background distribution being approximately uniform. Such objects, occasionally referred to as `events', can be considered as high energy blobs in the image. Unlike the images analyzed in conventional vision problems, very limited features are associated with such events, and their shape, size and count can vary significantly. This poses a challenge on the use of pre-trained models obtained from supervised approaches.   In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach involving iterative clustering based segmentation (ICS) which can detect target objects (events) in real-time. In this approach, a test image is analyzed over several cycles, and one event is identified per cycle. Each cycle consists of the following steps: (1) image segmentation using a modified k-means clustering method, (2) elimination of empty (with no events) segments based on statistical analysis of each segment, (3) merging segments that overlap (correspond to same event), and (4) selecting the strongest event. These four steps are repeated until all the events have been identified. The ICS approach consists of a few hyper-parameters that have been chosen based on statistical study performed over a set of test images. The applicability of ICS method is demonstrated on several 2D and 3D test examples.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Cascade Decoder: A Universal Decoding Method for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"The Encoder-Decoder architecture is a main stream deep learning model for biomedical image segmentation. The encoder fully compresses the input and generates encoded features, and the decoder then produces dense predictions using encoded features. However, decoders are still under-explored in such architectures. In this paper, we comprehensively study the state-of-the-art Encoder-Decoder architectures, and propose a new universal decoder, called cascade decoder, to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. Our cascade decoder can be embedded into existing networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The cascade decoder structure aims to conduct more effective decoding of hierarchically encoded features and is more compatible with common encoders than the known decoders. We replace the decoders of state-of-the-art models with our cascade decoder for several challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks, and the considerable improvements achieved demonstrate the efficacy of our new decoding method.",['cs.CV']
Automated Deep Photo Style Transfer,"Photorealism is a complex concept that cannot easily be formulated mathematically. Deep Photo Style Transfer is an attempt to transfer the style of a reference image to a content image while preserving its photorealism. This is achieved by introducing a constraint that prevents distortions in the content image and by applying the style transfer independently for semantically different parts of the images. In addition, an automated segmentation process is presented that consists of a neural network based segmentation method followed by a semantic grouping step. To further improve the results a measure for image aesthetics is used and elaborated. If the content and the style image are sufficiently similar, the result images look very realistic. With the automation of the image segmentation the pipeline becomes completely independent from any user interaction, which allows for new applications.",['cs.CV']
Deceiving End-to-End Deep Learning Malware Detectors using Adversarial Examples,"In recent years, deep learning has shown performance breakthroughs in many applications, such as image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and speech recognition. However, this comes with a major concern: deep networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are slightly modified inputs that are intentionally designed to cause a misclassification by the model. In the domains of images and speech, the modifications are so small that they are not seen or heard by humans, but nevertheless greatly affect the classification of the model.   Deep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection. In this domain, generating adversarial examples is not straightforward, as small modifications to the bytes of the file could lead to significant changes in its functionality and validity. We introduce a novel loss function for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for discrete input sets, such as executable bytes. We modify malicious binaries so that they would be detected as benign, while preserving their original functionality, by injecting a small sequence of bytes (payload) in the binary file. We applied this approach to an end-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and show a high rate of detection evasion. Moreover, we show that our generated payload is robust enough to be transferable within different locations of the same file and across different files, and that its entropy is low and similar to that of benign data sections.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CR']"
Unsupervised Meta-learning of Figure-Ground Segmentation via Imitating Visual Effects,"This paper presents a ""learning to learn"" approach to figure-ground image segmentation. By exploring webly-abundant images of specific visual effects, our method can effectively learn the visual-effect internal representations in an unsupervised manner and uses this knowledge to differentiate the figure from the ground in an image. Specifically, we formulate the meta-learning process as a compositional image editing task that learns to imitate a certain visual effect and derive the corresponding internal representation. Such a generative process can help instantiate the underlying figure-ground notion and enables the system to accomplish the intended image segmentation. Whereas existing generative methods are mostly tailored to image synthesis or style transfer, our approach offers a flexible learning mechanism to model a general concept of figure-ground segmentation from unorganized images that have no explicit pixel-level annotations. We validate our approach via extensive experiments on six datasets to demonstrate that the proposed model can be end-to-end trained without ground-truth pixel labeling yet outperforms the existing methods of unsupervised segmentation tasks.",['cs.CV']
SwipeCut: Interactive Segmentation with Diversified Seed Proposals,"Interactive image segmentation algorithms rely on the user to provide annotations as the guidance. When the task of interactive segmentation is performed on a small touchscreen device, the requirement of providing precise annotations could be cumbersome to the user. We design an efficient seed proposal method that actively proposes annotation seeds for the user to label. The user only needs to check which ones of the query seeds are inside the region of interest (ROI). We enforce the sparsity and diversity criteria on the selection of the query seeds. At each round of interaction the user is only presented with a small number of informative query seeds that are far apart from each other. As a result, we are able to derive a user friendly interaction mechanism for annotation on small touchscreen devices. The user merely has to swipe through on the ROI-relevant query seeds, which should be easy since those gestures are commonly used on a touchscreen. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on six publicly available datasets. The evaluation results show that our algorithm achieves high segmentation accuracy, with short response time and less user feedback.",['cs.CV']
Pixel Objectness: Learning to Segment Generic Objects Automatically in Images and Videos,"We propose an end-to-end learning framework for segmenting generic objects in both images and videos. Given a novel image or video, our approach produces a pixel-level mask for all ""object-like"" regions---even for object categories never seen during training. We formulate the task as a structured prediction problem of assigning an object/background label to each pixel, implemented using a deep fully convolutional network. When applied to a video, our model further incorporates a motion stream, and the network learns to combine both appearance and motion and attempts to extract all prominent objects whether they are moving or not. Beyond the core model, a second contribution of our approach is how it leverages varying strengths of training annotations. Pixel-level annotations are quite difficult to obtain, yet crucial for training a deep network approach for segmentation. Thus we propose ways to exploit weakly labeled data for learning dense foreground segmentation. For images, we show the value in mixing object category examples with image-level labels together with relatively few images with boundary-level annotations. For video, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with the network trained for image segmentation. Through experiments on multiple challenging image and video segmentation benchmarks, our method offers consistently strong results and improves the state-of-the-art for fully automatic segmentation of generic (unseen) objects. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach benefits image retrieval and image retargeting, both of which flourish when given our high-quality foreground maps.

Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation Using Hybrid Network,"Weakly-supervised instance segmentation, which could greatly save labor and time cost of pixel mask annotation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The commonly used pipeline firstly utilizes conventional image segmentation methods to automatically generate initial masks and then use them to train an off-the-shelf segmentation network in an iterative way. However, the initial generated masks usually contains a notable proportion of invalid masks which are mainly caused by small object instances. Directly using these initial masks to train segmentation model is harmful for the performance. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid network in this paper. In our architecture, there is a principle segmentation network which is used to handle the normal samples with valid generated masks. In addition, a complementary branch is added to handle the small and dim objects without valid masks. Experimental results indicate that our method can achieve significantly performance improvement both on the small object instances and large ones, and outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
Deep Neural Networks Motivated by Partial Differential Equations,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. Over the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction.   In this paper, we establish a new PDE-interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning.   Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall into two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']"
A New Ensemble Learning Framework for 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation,"3D image segmentation plays an important role in biomedical image analysis. Many 2D and 3D deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance on 3D biomedical image datasets. Yet, 2D and 3D models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and by unifying them together, one may be able to achieve more accurate results. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble learning framework for 3D biomedical image segmentation that combines the merits of 2D and 3D models. First, we develop a fully convolutional network based meta-learner to learn how to improve the results from 2D and 3D models (base-learners). Then, to minimize over-fitting for our sophisticated meta-learner, we devise a new training method that uses the results of the base-learners as multiple versions of ""ground truths"". Furthermore, since our new meta-learner training scheme does not depend on manual annotation, it can utilize abundant unlabeled 3D image data to further improve the model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (the HVSMR 2016 Challenge dataset and the mouse piriform cortex dataset) show that our approach is effective under fully-supervised, semi-supervised, and transductive settings, and attains superior performance over state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.",['cs.CV']
Exclusive Independent Probability Estimation using Deep 3D Fully Convolutional DenseNets: Application to IsoIntense Infant Brain MRI Segmentation,"The most recent fast and accurate image segmentation methods are built upon fully convolutional deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose new deep learning strategies for DenseNets to improve segmenting images with subtle differences in intensity values and features. We aim to segment brain tissue on infant brain MRI at about 6 months of age where white matter and gray matter of the developing brain show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, thus appear to have similar intensity values on both T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. Brain tissue segmentation at this age is, therefore, very challenging. To this end, we propose an exclusive multi-label training strategy to segment the mutually exclusive brain tissues with similarity loss functions that automatically balance the training based on class prevalence. Using our proposed training strategy based on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we decrease the number of parameters in the network, reduce the complexity of the training process focusing the attention on less number of tasks, while mitigating the effects of data imbalance between labels and inaccuracies near patch borders. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform fast image segmentation (90 seconds per 3D volume), using a network with less parameters than many state-of-the-art networks, overcoming issues such as 3Dvs2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the top performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods tested in first and second round submissions of the isointense infant brain MRI segmentation (iSeg) challenge according to the official challenge test results. Our proposed strategy improves the training process through balanced training and by reducing its complexity while providing a trained model that works for any size input image and is fast and more accurate than many state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
"""Double-DIP"": Unsupervised Image Decomposition via Coupled Deep-Image-Priors","Many seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks can be viewed as a special case of image decomposition into separate layers. For example, image segmentation (separation into foreground and background layers); transparent layer separation (into reflection and transmission layers); Image dehazing (separation into a clear image and a haze map), and more. In this paper we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, based on coupled ""Deep-image-Prior"" (DIP) networks. It was shown [Ulyanov et al] that the structure of a single DIP generator network is sufficient to capture the low-level statistics of a single image. We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications. This capability stems from the fact that the internal statistics of a mixture of layers is more complex than the statistics of each of its individual components. We show the power of this approach for Image-Dehazing, Fg/Bg Segmentation, Watermark-Removal, Transparency Separation in images and video, and more. These capabilities are achieved in a totally unsupervised way, with no training examples other than the input image/video itself.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Enhancing Label-Driven Deep Deformable Image Registration with Local Distance Metrics for State-of-the-Art Cardiac Motion Tracking,"While deep learning has achieved significant advances in accuracy for medical image segmentation, its benefits for deformable image registration have so far remained limited to reduced computation times. Previous work has either focused on replacing the iterative optimization of distance and smoothness terms with CNN-layers or using supervised approaches driven by labels. Our method is the first to combine the complementary strengths of global semantic information (represented by segmentation labels) and local distance metrics that help align surrounding structures. We demonstrate significant higher Dice scores (of 86.5\%) for deformable cardiac image registration compared to classic registration (79.0\%) as well as label-driven deep learning frameworks (83.4\%).",['cs.CV']
MDU-Net: Multi-scale Densely Connected U-Net for biomedical image segmentation,"Radiologist is ""doctor's doctor"", biomedical image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagnosis, and medical intervention. In the light of the fully convolutional networks (FCN) and U-Net, deep convolutional networks (DNNs) have made significant contributions in biomedical image segmentation applications. In this paper, based on U-Net, we propose MDUnet, a multi-scale densely connected U-net for biomedical image segmentation. we propose three different multi-scale dense connections for U shaped architectures encoder, decoder and across them. The highlights of our architecture is directly fuses the neighboring different scale feature maps from both higher layers and lower layers to strengthen feature propagation in current layer. Which can largely improves the information flow encoder, decoder and across them. Multi-scale dense connections, which means containing shorter connections between layers close to the input and output, also makes much deeper U-net possible. We adopt the optimal model based on the experiment and propose a novel Multi-scale Dense U-Net (MDU-Net) architecture with quantization. Which reduce overfitting in MDU-Net for better accuracy. We evaluate our purpose model on the MICCAI 2015 Gland Segmentation dataset (GlaS). The three multi-scale dense connections improve U-net performance by up to 1.8% on test A and 3.5% on test B in the MICCAI Gland dataset. Meanwhile the MDU-net with quantization achieves the superiority over U-Net performance by up to 3% on test A and 4.1% on test B.",['cs.CV']
DSCnet: Replicating Lidar Point Clouds with Deep Sensor Cloning,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular for solving a variety of computer vision tasks, ranging from image classification to image segmentation. Recently, autonomous vehicles have created a demand for depth information, which is often obtained using hardware sensors such as Light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Although it can provide precise distance measurements, most LIDARs are still far too expensive to sell in mass-produced consumer vehicles, which has motivated methods to generate depth information from commodity automotive sensors like cameras.   In this paper, we propose an approach called Deep Sensor Cloning (DSC). The idea is to use Convolutional Neural Networks in conjunction with inexpensive sensors to replicate the 3D point-clouds that are created by expensive LIDARs. To accomplish this, we develop a new dataset (DSDepth) and a new family of CNN architectures (DSCnets). While previous tasks such as KITTI depth prediction use an interpolated RGB-D images as ground-truth for training, we instead use DSCnets to directly predict LIDAR point-clouds. When we compare the output of our models to a $75,000 LIDAR, we find that our most accurate DSCnet achieves a relative error of 5.77% using a single camera and 4.69% using stereo cameras.",['cs.CV']
Foreground Clustering for Joint Segmentation and Localization in Videos and Images,"This paper presents a novel framework in which video/image segmentation and localization are cast into a single optimization problem that integrates information from low level appearance cues with that of high level localization cues in a very weakly supervised manner. The proposed framework leverages two representations at different levels, exploits the spatial relationship between bounding boxes and superpixels as linear constraints and simultaneously discriminates between foreground and background at bounding box and superpixel level. Different from previous approaches that mainly rely on discriminative clustering, we incorporate a foreground model that minimizes the histogram difference of an object across all image frames. Exploiting the geometric relation between the superpixels and bounding boxes enables the transfer of segmentation cues to improve localization output and vice-versa. Inclusion of the foreground model generalizes our discriminative framework to video data where the background tends to be similar and thus, not discriminative. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework on the YouTube Object video dataset, Internet Object Discovery dataset and Pascal VOC 2007.","['cs.CV', 'cs.GR', 'cs.LG']"
Marginal Weighted Maximum Log-likelihood for Efficient Learning of Perturb-and-Map models,"We consider the structured-output prediction problem through probabilistic approaches and generalize the ""perturb-and-MAP"" framework to more challenging weighted Hamming losses, which are crucial in applications. While in principle our approach is a straightforward marginalization, it requires solving many related MAP inference problems. We show that for log-supermodular pairwise models these operations can be performed efficiently using the machinery of dynamic graph cuts. We also propose to use double stochastic gradient descent, both on the data and on the perturbations, for efficient learning. Our framework can naturally take weak supervision (e.g., partial labels) into account. We conduct a set of experiments on medium-scale character recognition and image segmentation, showing the benefits of our algorithms.","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']"
Learning to Steer by Mimicking Features from Heterogeneous Auxiliary Networks,"The training of many existing end-to-end steering angle prediction models heavily relies on steering angles as the supervisory signal. Without learning from much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of sharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe lighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature mimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much richer contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train our steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different tasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to multi-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of related tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary off-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in different layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded after training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on Udacity and Comma.ai, outperforming the previous best by a large margin of 12.8% and 52.1%, respectively. Encouraging results are also shown on Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset.",['cs.CV']
"A Novel Extension to Fuzzy Connectivity for Body Composition Analysis: Applications in Thigh, Brain, and Whole Body Tissue Segmentation","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for body tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. However, quantification of body composition requires an accurate segmentation of fat, muscle and other tissues from MR images, which remains a challenging goal due to the intensity overlap between them. In this study, we propose a fully automated, data-driven image segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while producing high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most approaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool which takes into account variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity definition within the fuzzy connectivity (FC) image segmentation family, prevents the need for user intervention and reparametrization of the segmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole system fully automated, we adapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify tissue regions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm's individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from the literature for the main application of muscle/fat separation. Furthermore, whole-body tissue composition and brain tissue delineation were conducted to show the generalization ability of the proposed system. This new automated platform outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches both in accuracy and efficiency.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Light-Weight RefineNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"We consider an important task of effective and efficient semantic image segmentation. In particular, we adapt a powerful semantic segmentation architecture, called RefineNet, into the more compact one, suitable even for tasks requiring real-time performance on high-resolution inputs. To this end, we identify computationally expensive blocks in the original setup, and propose two modifications aimed to decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations. By doing that, we achieve more than twofold model reduction, while keeping the performance levels almost intact. Our fastest model undergoes a significant speed-up boost from 20 FPS to 55 FPS on a generic GPU card on 512x512 inputs with solid 81.1% mean iou performance on the test set of PASCAL VOC, while our slowest model with 32 FPS (from original 17 FPS) shows 82.7% mean iou on the same dataset. Alternatively, we showcase that our approach is easily mixable with light-weight classification networks: we attain 79.2% mean iou on PASCAL VOC using a model that contains only 3.3M parameters and performs only 9.3B floating point operations.",['cs.CV']
Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking,"In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for anatomy segmentation and automatic landmark- ing. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of mandible segmentation from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and identification of 9 anatomical landmarks of the mandible on the geodesic space. The overall approach employs three inter-related steps. In step 1, we propose a deep neu- ral network architecture with carefully designed regularization, and network hyper-parameters to perform image segmentation without the need for data augmentation and complex post- processing refinement. In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. The proposed fully automated method showed superior efficacy compared to the state-of-the- art mandible segmentation and landmarking approaches in craniofacial anomalies and diseased states. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability. We have also shown feasibility of the proposed work in an independent dataset from MICCAI Head-Neck Challenge (2015) achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, we present an in-depth analysis of the proposed deep networks with respect to the choice of hyper-parameters such as pooling and activation functions.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
A Fully Convolutional Two-Stream Fusion Network for Interactive Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional two-stream fusion network (FCTSFN) for interactive image segmentation. The proposed network includes two sub-networks: a two-stream late fusion network (TSLFN) that predicts the foreground at a reduced resolution, and a multi-scale refining network (MSRN) that refines the foreground at full resolution. The TSLFN includes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network. The intuition is that, since user interactions are more direct information on foreground/background than the image itself, the two-stream structure of the TSLFN reduces the number of layers between the pure user interaction features and the network output, allowing the user interactions to have a more direct impact on the segmentation result. The MSRN fuses the features from different layers of TSLFN with different scales, in order to seek the local to global information on the foreground to refine the segmentation result at full resolution. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation methods",['cs.CV']
Learning Discriminators as Energy Networks in Adversarial Learning,"We propose a novel framework for structured prediction via adversarial learning. Existing adversarial learning methods involve two separate networks, i.e., the structured prediction models and the discriminative models, in the training. The information captured by discriminative models complements that in the structured prediction models, but few existing researches have studied on utilizing such information to improve structured prediction models at the inference stage. In this work, we propose to refine the predictions of structured prediction models by effectively integrating discriminative models into the prediction. Discriminative models are treated as energy-based models. Similar to the adversarial learning, discriminative models are trained to estimate scores which measure the quality of predicted outputs, while structured prediction models are trained to predict contrastive outputs with maximal energy scores. In this way, the gradient vanishing problem is ameliorated, and thus we are able to perform inference by following the ascent gradient directions of discriminative models to refine structured prediction models. The proposed method is able to handle a range of tasks, e.g., multi-label classification and image segmentation. Empirical results on these two tasks validate the effectiveness of our learning method.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']"
Augmented Mitotic Cell Count using Field Of Interest Proposal,"Histopathological prognostication of neoplasia including most tumor grading systems are based upon a number of criteria. Probably the most important is the number of mitotic figures which are most commonly determined as the mitotic count (MC), i.e. number of mitotic figures within 10 consecutive high power fields. Often the area with the highest mitotic activity is to be selected for the MC. However, since mitotic activity is not known in advance, an arbitrary choice of this region is considered one important cause for high variability in the prognostication and grading.   In this work, we present an algorithmic approach that first calculates a mitotic cell map based upon a deep convolutional network. This map is in a second step used to construct a mitotic activity estimate. Lastly, we select the image segment representing the size of ten high power fields with the overall highest mitotic activity as a region proposal for an expert MC determination. We evaluate the approach using a dataset of 32 completely annotated whole slide images, where 22 were used for training of the network and 10 for test. We find a correlation of r=0.936 in mitotic count estimate.",['cs.CV']
nnU-Net: Self-adapting Framework for U-Net-Based Medical Image Segmentation,"The U-Net was presented in 2015. With its straight-forward and successful architecture it quickly evolved to a commonly used benchmark in medical image segmentation. The adaptation of the U-Net to novel problems, however, comprises several degrees of freedom regarding the exact architecture, preprocessing, training and inference. These choices are not independent of each other and substantially impact the overall performance. The present paper introduces the nnU-Net ('no-new-Net'), which refers to a robust and self-adapting framework on the basis of 2D and 3D vanilla U-Nets. We argue the strong case for taking away superfluous bells and whistles of many proposed network designs and instead focus on the remaining aspects that make out the performance and generalizability of a method. We evaluate the nnU-Net in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, which measures segmentation performance in ten disciplines comprising distinct entities, image modalities, image geometries and dataset sizes, with no manual adjustments between datasets allowed. At the time of manuscript submission, nnU-Net achieves the highest mean dice scores across all classes and seven phase 1 tasks (except class 1 in BrainTumour) in the online leaderboard of the challenge.",['cs.CV']
Image Reconstruction Using Deep Learning,"This paper proposes a deep learning architecture that attains statistically significant improvements over traditional algorithms in Poisson image denoising espically when the noise is strong. Poisson noise commonly occurs in low-light and photon- limited settings, where the noise can be most accurately modeled by the Poission distribution. Poisson noise traditionally prevails only in specific fields such as astronomical imaging. However, with the booming market of surveillance cameras, which commonly operate in low-light environments, or mobile phones, which produce noisy night scene pictures due to lower-grade sensors, the necessity for an advanced Poisson image denoising algorithm has increased. Deep learning has achieved amazing breakthroughs in other imaging problems, such image segmentation and recognition, and this paper proposes a deep learning denoising network that outperforms traditional algorithms in Poisson denoising especially when the noise is strong. The architecture incorporates a hybrid of convolutional and deconvolutional layers along with symmetric connections. The denoising network achieved statistically significant 0.38dB, 0.68dB, and 1.04dB average PSNR gains over benchmark traditional algorithms in experiments with image peak values 4, 2, and 1. The denoising network can also operate with shorter computational time while still outperforming the benchmark algorithm by tuning the reconstruction stride sizes.",['cs.CV']
3D Segmentation with Exponential Logarithmic Loss for Highly Unbalanced Object Sizes,"With the introduction of fully convolutional neural networks, deep learning has raised the benchmark for medical image segmentation on both speed and accuracy, and different networks have been proposed for 2D and 3D segmentation with promising results. Nevertheless, most networks only handle relatively small numbers of labels (<10), and there are very limited works on handling highly unbalanced object sizes especially in 3D segmentation. In this paper, we propose a network architecture and the corresponding loss function which improve segmentation of very small structures. By combining skip connections and deep supervision with respect to the computational feasibility of 3D segmentation, we propose a fast converging and computationally efficient network architecture for accurate segmentation. Furthermore, inspired by the concept of focal loss, we propose an exponential logarithmic loss which balances the labels not only by their relative sizes but also by their segmentation difficulties. We achieve an average Dice coefficient of 82% on brain segmentation with 20 labels, with the ratio of the smallest to largest object sizes as 0.14%. Less than 100 epochs are required to reach such accuracy, and segmenting a 128x128x128 volume only takes around 0.4 s.",['cs.CV']
Modern Convex Optimization to Medical Image Analysis,"Recently, diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of human diseases involve a variety of imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), computed tomography(CT), Ultrasound(US) and Positron-emission tomography(PET) as well as a variety of modern optical techniques. Over the past two decade, it has been recognized that advanced image processing techniques provide valuable information to physicians for diagnosis, image guided therapy and surgery, and monitoring of the treated organ to the therapy. Many researchers and companies have invested significant efforts in the developments of advanced medical image analysis methods; especially in the two core studies of medical image segmentation and registration, segmentations of organs and lesions are used to quantify volumes and shapes used in diagnosis and monitoring treatment; registration of multimodality images of organs improves detection, diagnosis and staging of diseases as well as image-guided surgery and therapy, registration of images obtained from the same modality are used to monitor progression of therapy. These challenging clinical-motivated applications introduce novel and sophisticated mathematical problems which stimulate developments of advanced optimization and computing methods, especially convex optimization attaining optimum in a global sense, hence, bring an enormous spread of research topics for recent computational medical image analysis. Particularly, distinct from the usual image processing, most medical images have a big volume of acquired data, often in 3D or 4D (3D + t) along with great noises or incomplete image information, and form the challenging large-scale optimization problems; how to process such poor 'big data' of medical images efficiently and solve the corresponding optimization problems robustly are the key factors of modern medical image analysis.",['cs.CV']
Searching for Efficient Multi-Scale Architectures for Dense Image Prediction,"The design of neural network architectures is an important component for achieving state-of-the-art performance with machine learning systems across a broad array of tasks. Much work has endeavored to design and build architectures automatically through clever construction of a search space paired with simple learning algorithms. Recent progress has demonstrated that such meta-learning methods may exceed scalable human-invented architectures on image classification tasks. An open question is the degree to which such methods may generalize to new domains. In this work we explore the construction of meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing, person-part segmentation, and semantic image segmentation. Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image prediction, we construct a recursive search space and demonstrate that even with efficient random search, we can identify architectures that outperform human-invented architectures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three dense prediction tasks including 82.7\% on Cityscapes (street scene parsing), 71.3\% on PASCAL-Person-Part (person-part segmentation), and 87.9\% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (semantic image segmentation). Additionally, the resulting architecture is more computationally efficient, requiring half the parameters and half the computational cost as previous state of the art systems.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Computation of Total Kidney Volume from CT images in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease using Multi-Task 3D Convolutional Neural Networks,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) characterized by progressive growth of renal cysts is the most prevalent and potentially lethal monogenic renal disease, affecting one in every 500-100 people. Total Kidney Volume (TKV) and its growth computed from Computed Tomography images has been accepted as an essential prognostic marker for renal function loss. Due to large variation in shape and size of kidney in ADPKD, existing methods to compute TKV (i.e. to segment ADKP) including those based on 2D convolutional neural networks are not accurate enough to be directly useful in clinical practice. In this work, we propose multi-task 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to segment ADPK and achieve a mean DICE score of 0.95 and mean absolute percentage TKV error of 3.86. Additionally, to solve the challenge of class imbalance, we propose to simply bootstrap cross entropy loss and compare results with recently prevalent dice loss in medical image segmentation community.",['cs.CV']
Retinal Vessel Segmentation under Extreme Low Annotation: A Generative Adversarial Network Approach,"Contemporary deep learning based medical image segmentation algorithms require hours of annotation labor by domain experts. These data hungry deep models perform sub-optimally in the presence of limited amount of labeled data. In this paper, we present a data efficient learning framework using the recent concept of Generative Adversarial Networks; this allows a deep neural network to perform significantly better than its fully supervised counterpart in low annotation regime. The proposed method is an extension of our previous work with the addition of a new unsupervised adversarial loss and a structured prediction based architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an adversarial framework based structured prediction model for medical image segmentation. Though generic, we apply our method for segmentation of blood vessels in retinal fundus images. We experiment with extreme low annotation budget (0.8 - 1.6% of contemporary annotation size). On DRIVE and STARE datasets, the proposed method outperforms our previous method and other fully supervised benchmark models by significant margins especially with very low number of annotated examples. In addition, our systematic ablation studies suggest some key recipes for successfully training GAN based semi-supervised algorithms with an encoder-decoder style network architecture.",['cs.CV']
Image Segmentation with Pseudo-marginal MCMC Sampling and Nonparametric Shape Priors,"In this paper, we propose an efficient pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach to draw samples from posterior shape distributions for image segmentation. The computation time of the proposed approach is independent from the size of the training set used to learn the shape prior distribution nonparametrically. Therefore, it scales well for very large data sets. Our approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.",['cs.CV']
YouTube-VOS: Sequence-to-Sequence Video Object Segmentation,"Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatial-temporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and human activities. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and we have released it at https://youtube-vos.org. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence network to fully exploit long-term spatial-temporal information in videos for segmentation. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve the best results on our YouTube-VOS test set and comparable results on DAVIS 2016 compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that the large scale dataset is indeed a key factor to the success of our model.",['cs.CV']

Document Image Classification with Intra-Domain Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"In this work, a region-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network framework is proposed for document structure learning. The contribution of this work involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective ensembling for document image classification. A primary level of `inter-domain' transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16 architecture on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole document images. Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a secondary level of `intra-domain' transfer learning is used for rapid training of deep learning models for image segments. Finally, stacked generalization based ensembling is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep neural network models. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.2% on the popular RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding benchmarks set by existing algorithms.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Multi-level Activation for Segmentation of Hierarchically-nested Classes,"For many biological image segmentation tasks, including topological knowledge, such as the nesting of classes, can greatly improve results. However, most `out-of-the-box' CNN models are still blind to such prior information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to encode this information, through a multi-level activation layer and three compatible losses. We benchmark all of them on nuclei segmentation in bright-field microscopy cell images from the 2018 Data Science Bowl challenge, offering an exemplary segmentation task with cells and nested subcellular structures. Our scheme greatly speeds up learning, and outperforms standard multi-class classification with soft-max activation and a previously proposed method stemming from it, improving the Dice score significantly (p-values<0.007). Our approach is conceptually simple, easy to implement and can be integrated in any CNN architecture. It can be generalized to a higher number of classes, with or without further relations of containment.",['cs.CV']
Concept Mask: Large-Scale Segmentation from Semantic Concepts,"Existing works on semantic segmentation typically consider a small number of labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels, training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes. We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts, and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and unseen concepts.",['cs.CV']
Holographic Visualisation of Radiology Data and Automated Machine Learning-based Medical Image Segmentation,"Within this thesis we propose a platform for combining Augmented Reality (AR) hardware with machine learning in a user-oriented pipeline, offering to the medical staff an intuitive 3D visualization of volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) medical image segmentations inside the AR headset, that does not need human intervention for loading, processing and segmentation of medical images. The AR visualization, based on Microsoft HoloLens, employs a modular and thus scalable frontend-backend architecture for real-time visualizations on multiple AR headsets. As Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have lastly demonstrated superior performance for the machine learning task of image semantic segmentation, the pipeline also includes a fully automated CNN algorithm for the segmentation of the liver from CT scans. The model is based on the Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU) model which is a Fully Convolutional Network with side outputs from feature maps with different resolution, extracted at different stages of the network. The algorithm is 2.5D which means that the input is a set of consecutive scan slices. The experiments have been performed on the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) dataset for liver segmentation and demonstrated good results and flexibility. While multiple approaches exist in the domain, only few of them have focused on overcoming the practical aspects which still largely hold this technology away from the operating rooms. In line with this, we also are next planning an evaluation from medical doctors and radiologists in a real-world environment.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
An Iterative Boundary Random Walks Algorithm for Interactive Image Segmentation,"The interactive image segmentation algorithm can provide an intelligent ways to understand the intention of user input. Many interactive methods have the problem of that ask for large number of user input. To efficient produce intuitive segmentation under limited user input is important for industrial application. In this paper, we reveal a positive feedback system on image segmentation to show the pixels of self-learning. Two approaches, iterative random walks and boundary random walks, are proposed for segmentation potential, which is the key step in feedback system. Experiment results on image segmentation indicates that proposed algorithms can obtain more efficient input to random walks. And higher segmentation performance can be obtained by applying the iterative boundary random walks algorithm.",['cs.CV']
Dilated Convolutions in Neural Networks for Left Atrial Segmentation in 3D Gadolinium Enhanced-MRI,"Segmentation of the left atrial chamber and assessing its morphology, are essential for improving our understanding of atrial fibrillation, the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. Automation of this process in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI (GE-MRI) data is desirable, as manual delineation is time-consuming, challenging and observer-dependent. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained tremendous traction and achieved state-of-the-art results in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to incorporate local and global information without using contracting (pooling) layers, which in turn reduces segmentation accuracy for smaller structures. In this paper, we propose a 3D CNN for volumetric segmentation of the left atrial chamber in LGE-MRI. Our network is based on the well known U-Net architecture. We employ a 3D fully convolutional network, with dilated convolutions in the lowest level of the network, and residual connections between encoder blocks to incorporate local and global knowledge. The results show that including global context through the use of dilated convolutions, helps in domain adaptation, and the overall segmentation accuracy is improved in comparison to a 3D U-Net.",['cs.CV']
Neural Multi-Atlas Label Fusion: Application to Cardiac MR Images,"Multi-atlas segmentation approach is one of the most widely-used image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. There are two major challenges in this category of methods, i.e., atlas selection and label fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-atlas segmentation method that formulates multi-atlas segmentation in a deep learning framework for better solving these challenges. The proposed method, dubbed deep fusion net (DFN), is a deep architecture that integrates a feature extraction subnet and a non-local patch-based label fusion (NL-PLF) subnet in a single network. The network parameters are learned by end-to-end training for automatically learning deep features that enable optimal performance in a NL-PLF framework. The learned deep features are further utilized in defining a similarity measure for atlas selection. By evaluating on two public cardiac MR datasets of SATA-13 and LV-09 for left ventricle segmentation, our approach achieved 0.833 in averaged Dice metric (ADM) on SATA-13 dataset and 0.95 in ADM for epicardium segmentation on LV-09 dataset, comparing favorably with the other automatic left ventricle segmentation methods. We also tested our approach on Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) testing set of MICCAI 2013 SATA Segmentation Challenge, and our method achieved 0.815 in ADM, ranking highest at the time of writing.",['cs.CV']
Efficient Yet Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic Segmentation using deep convolutional neural network pose more complex challenge for any GPU intensive task. As it has to compute million of parameters, it results to huge memory consumption. Moreover, extracting finer features and conducting supervised training tends to increase the complexity. With the introduction of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, which uses finer strides and utilizes deconvolutional layers for upsampling, it has been a go to for any image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose two segmentation architecture which not only needs one-third the parameters to compute but also gives better accuracy than the similar architectures. The model weights were transferred from the popular neural net like VGG19 and VGG16 which were trained on Imagenet classification data-set. Then we transform all the fully connected layers to convolutional layers and use dilated convolution for decreasing the parameters. Lastly, we add finer strides and attach four skip architectures which are element-wise summed with the deconvolutional layers in steps. We train and test on different sparse and fine data-sets like Pascal VOC2012, Pascal-Context and NYUDv2 and show how better our model performs in this tasks. On the other hand our model has a faster inference time and consumes less memory for training and testing on NVIDIA Pascal GPUs, making it more efficient and less memory consuming architecture for pixel-wise segmentation.",['cs.CV']
A Data-driven Prior on Facet Orientation for Semantic Mesh Labeling,"Mesh labeling is the key problem of classifying the facets of a 3D mesh with a label among a set of possible ones. State-of-the-art methods model mesh labeling as a Markov Random Field over the facets. These algorithms map image segmentations to the mesh by minimizing an energy function that comprises a data term, a smoothness terms, and class-specific priors. The latter favor a labeling with respect to another depending on the orientation of the facet normals. In this paper we propose a novel energy term that acts as a prior, but does not require any prior knowledge about the scene nor scene-specific relationship among classes. It bootstraps from a coarse mapping of the 2D segmentations on the mesh, and it favors the facets to be labeled according to the statistics of the mesh normals in their neighborhood. We tested our approach against five different datasets and, even if we do not inject prior knowledge, our method adapts to the data and overcomes the state-of-the-art.",['cs.CV']
Feature Fusion through Multitask CNN for Large-scale Remote Sensing Image Segmentation,"In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) has been widely used in various semantic segmentation tasks, including multi-modal remote sensing imagery. How to fuse multi-modal data to improve the segmentation performance has always been a research hotspot. In this paper, a novel end-toend fully convolutional neural network is proposed for semantic segmentation of natural color, infrared imagery and Digital Surface Models (DSM). It is based on a modified DeepUNet and perform the segmentation in a multi-task way. The channels are clustered into groups and processed on different task pipelines. After a series of segmentation and fusion, their shared features and private features are successfully merged together. Experiment results show that the feature fusion network is efficient. And our approach achieves good performance in ISPRS Semantic Labeling Contest (2D).",['cs.CV']
Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Atrous Convolution via DeepLab v3,"As melanoma diagnoses increase across the US, automated efforts to identify malignant lesions become increasingly of interest to the research community. Segmentation of dermoscopic images is the first step in this process, thus accuracy is crucial. Although techniques utilizing convolutional neural networks have been used in the past for lesion segmentation, we present a solution employing the recently published DeepLab 3, an atrous convolution method for image segmentation. Although the results produced by this run are not ideal, with a mean Jaccard index of 0.498, we believe that with further adjustments and modifications to the compatibility with the DeepLab code and with training on more powerful processing units, this method may achieve better results in future trials.",['cs.CV']
Clearing noisy annotations for computed tomography imaging,"One of the problems on the way to successful implementation of neural networks is the quality of annotation. For instance, different annotators can annotate images in a different way and very often their decisions do not match exactly and in extreme cases are even mutually exclusive which results in noisy annotations and, consequently, inaccurate predictions.   To avoid that problem in the task of computed tomography (CT) imaging segmentation we propose a clearing algorithm for annotations. It consists of 3 stages:   - annotators scoring, which assigns a higher confidence level to better annotators;   - nodules scoring, which assigns a higher confidence level to nodules confirmed by good annotators;   - nodules merging, which aggregates annotations according to nodules confidence.   In general, the algorithm can be applied to many different tasks (namely, binary and multi-class semantic segmentation, and also with trivial adjustments to classification and regression) where there are several annotators labeling each image.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Cross Pixel Optical Flow Similarity for Self-Supervised Learning,"We propose a novel method for learning convolutional neural image representations without manual supervision. We use motion cues in the form of optical flow, to supervise representations of static images. The obvious approach of training a network to predict flow from a single image can be needlessly difficult due to intrinsic ambiguities in this prediction task. We instead propose a much simpler learning goal: embed pixels such that the similarity between their embeddings matches that between their optical flow vectors. At test time, the learned deep network can be used without access to video or flow information and transferred to tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation. Our method, which significantly simplifies previous attempts at using motion for self-supervision, achieves state-of-the-art results in self-supervision using motion cues, competitive results for self-supervision in general, and is overall state of the art in self-supervised pretraining for semantic image segmentation, as demonstrated on standard benchmarks.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']"
Boosted Training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Multi-Class Segmentation,"Training deep neural networks on large and sparse datasets is still challenging and can require large amounts of computation and memory. In this work, we address the task of performing semantic segmentation on large volumetric data sets, such as CT scans. Our contribution is threefold: 1) We propose a boosted sampling scheme that uses a-posterior error maps, generated throughout training, to focus sampling on difficult regions, resulting in a more informative loss. This results in a significant training speed up and improves learning performance for image segmentation. 2) We propose a novel algorithm for boosting the SGD learning rate schedule by adaptively increasing and lowering the learning rate, avoiding the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. 3) We show that our method is able to attain new state-of-the-art results on the VISCERAL Anatomy benchmark.",['cs.CV']
SynNet: Structure-Preserving Fully Convolutional Networks for Medical Image Synthesis,"Cross modal image syntheses is gaining significant interests for its ability to estimate target images of a different modality from a given set of source images,like estimating MR to MR, MR to CT, CT to PET etc, without the need for an actual acquisition.Though they show potential for applications in radiation therapy planning,image super resolution, atlas construction, image segmentation etc.The synthesis results are not as accurate as the actual acquisition.In this paper,we address the problem of multi modal image synthesis by proposing a fully convolutional deep learning architecture called the SynNet.We extend the proposed architecture for various input output configurations. And finally, we propose a structure preserving custom loss function for cross-modal image synthesis.We validate the proposed SynNet and its extended framework on BRATS dataset with comparisons against three state-of-the art methods.And the results of the proposed custom loss function is validated against the traditional loss function used by the state-of-the-art methods for cross modal image synthesis.",['cs.CV']
Combining Pyramid Pooling and Attention Mechanism for Pelvic MR Image Semantic Segmentaion,"One of the time-consuming routine work for a radiologist is to discern anatomical structures from tomographic images. For assisting radiologists, this paper develops an automatic segmentation method for pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) images. The task has three major challenges 1) A pelvic organ can have various sizes and shapes depending on the axial image, which requires local contexts to segment correctly. 2) Different organs often have quite similar appearance in MR images, which requires global context to segment. 3) The number of available annotated images are very small to use the latest segmentation algorithms. To address the challenges, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called Attention-Pyramid network (APNet) that effectively exploits both local and global contexts, in addition to a data-augmentation technique that is particularly effective for MR images. In order to evaluate our method, we construct fine-grained (50 pelvic organs) MR image segmentation dataset, and experimentally confirm the superior performance of our techniques over the state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.",['cs.CV']
Towards safe deep learning: accurately quantifying biomarker uncertainty in neural network predictions,"Automated medical image segmentation, specifically using deep learning, has shown outstanding performance in semantic segmentation tasks. However, these methods rarely quantify their uncertainty, which may lead to errors in downstream analysis. In this work we propose to use Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty within the domain of semantic segmentation. We also propose a method to convert voxel-wise segmentation uncertainty into volumetric uncertainty, and calibrate the accuracy and reliability of confidence intervals of derived measurements. When applied to a tumour volume estimation application, we demonstrate that by using such modelling of uncertainty, deep learning systems can be made to report volume estimates with well-calibrated error-bars, making them safer for clinical use. We also show that the uncertainty estimates extrapolate to unseen data, and that the confidence intervals are robust in the presence of artificial noise. This could be used to provide a form of quality control and quality assurance, and may permit further adoption of deep learning tools in the clinic.",['cs.CV']
Augmented CycleGAN: Learning Many-to-Many Mappings from Unpaired Data,"Learning inter-domain mappings from unpaired data can improve performance in structured prediction tasks, such as image segmentation, by reducing the need for paired data. CycleGAN was recently proposed for this problem, but critically assumes the underlying inter-domain mapping is approximately deterministic and one-to-one. This assumption renders the model ineffective for tasks requiring flexible, many-to-many mappings. We propose a new model, called Augmented CycleGAN, which learns many-to-many mappings between domains. We examine Augmented CycleGAN qualitatively and quantitatively on several image datasets.",['cs.LG']
NeuroNet: Fast and Robust Reproduction of Multiple Brain Image Segmentation Pipelines,"NeuroNet is a deep convolutional neural network mimicking multiple popular and state-of-the-art brain segmentation tools including FSL, SPM, and MALPEM. The network is trained on 5,000 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank Imaging Study that have been automatically segmented into brain tissue and cortical and sub-cortical structures using the standard neuroimaging pipelines. Training a single model from these complementary and partially overlapping label maps yields a new powerful ""all-in-one"", multi-output segmentation tool. The processing time for a single subject is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to running each individual software package. We demonstrate very good reproducibility of the original outputs while increasing robustness to variations in the input data. We believe NeuroNet could be an important tool in large-scale population imaging studies and serve as a new standard in neuroscience by reducing the risk of introducing bias when choosing a specific software package.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Retinal Optic Disc Segmentation using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"This paper proposed a retinal image segmentation method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to segment optic disc. The proposed model consists of two successive networks: generator and discriminator. The generator learns to map information from the observing input (i.e., retinal fundus color image), to the output (i.e., binary mask). Then, the discriminator learns as a loss function to train this mapping by comparing the ground-truth and the predicted output with observing the input image as a condition.Experiments were performed on two publicly available dataset; DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE. The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art-methods by achieving around 0.96% and 0.98% of Jaccard and Dice coefficients, respectively. Moreover, an image segmentation is performed in less than a second on recent GPU.",['cs.CV']
On the Effect of Inter-observer Variability for a Reliable Estimation of Uncertainty of Medical Image Segmentation,"Uncertainty estimation methods are expected to improve the understanding and quality of computer-assisted methods used in medical applications (e.g., neurosurgical interventions, radiotherapy planning), where automated medical image segmentation is crucial. In supervised machine learning, a common practice to generate ground truth label data is to merge observer annotations. However, as many medical image tasks show a high inter-observer variability resulting from factors such as image quality, different levels of user expertise and domain knowledge, little is known as to how inter-observer variability and commonly used fusion methods affect the estimation of uncertainty of automated image segmentation. In this paper we analyze the effect of common image label fusion techniques on uncertainty estimation, and propose to learn the uncertainty among observers. The results highlight the negative effect of fusion methods applied in deep learning, to obtain reliable estimates of segmentation uncertainty. Additionally, we show that the learned observers' uncertainty can be combined with current standard Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural networks to characterize uncertainty of model's parameters.",['cs.CV']
CFCM: Segmentation via Coarse to Fine Context Memory,"Recent neural-network-based architectures for image segmentation make extensive usage of feature forwarding mechanisms to integrate information from multiple scales. Although yielding good results, even deeper architectures and alternative methods for feature fusion at different resolutions have been scarcely investigated for medical applications. In this work we propose to implement segmentation via an encoder-decoder architecture which differs from any other previously published method since (i) it employs a very deep architecture based on residual learning and (ii) combines features via a convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), instead of concatenation or summation. The intuition is that the memory mechanism implemented by LSTMs can better integrate features from different scales through a coarse-to-fine strategy; hence the name Coarse-to-Fine Context Memory (CFCM). We demonstrate the remarkable advantages of this approach on two datasets: the Montgomery county lung segmentation dataset, and the EndoVis 2015 challenge dataset for surgical instrument segmentation.",['cs.CV']
3D Shape Segmentation via Shape Fully Convolutional Networks,"We desgin a novel fully convolutional network architecture for shapes, denoted by Shape Fully Convolutional Networks (SFCN). 3D shapes are represented as graph structures in the SFCN architecture, based on novel graph convolution and pooling operations, which are similar to convolution and pooling operations used on images. Meanwhile, to build our SFCN architecture in the original image segmentation fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture, we also design and implement a generating operation} with bridging function. This ensures that the convolution and pooling operation we have designed can be successfully applied in the original FCN architecture. In this paper, we also present a new shape segmentation approach based on SFCN. Furthermore, we allow more general and challenging input, such as mixed datasets of different categories of shapes} which can prove the ability of our generalisation. In our approach, SFCNs are trained triangles-to-triangles by using three low-level geometric features as input. Finally, the feature voting-based multi-label graph cuts is adopted to optimise the segmentation results obtained by SFCN prediction. The experiment results show that our method can effectively learn and predict mixed shape datasets of either similar or different characteristics, and achieve excellent segmentation results.",['cs.CV']
Quickshift++: Provably Good Initializations for Sample-Based Mean Shift,"We provide initial seedings to the Quick Shift clustering algorithm, which approximate the locally high-density regions of the data. Such seedings act as more stable and expressive cluster-cores than the singleton modes found by Quick Shift. We establish statistical consistency guarantees for this modification. We then show strong clustering performance on real datasets as well as promising applications to image segmentation.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Consensus Based Medical Image Segmentation Using Semi-Supervised Learning And Graph Cuts,"Medical image segmentation requires consensus ground truth segmentations to be derived from multiple expert annotations. A novel approach is proposed that obtains consensus segmentations from experts using graph cuts (GC) and semi supervised learning (SSL). Popular approaches use iterative Expectation Maximization (EM) to estimate the final annotation and quantify annotator's performance. Such techniques pose the risk of getting trapped in local minima. We propose a self consistency (SC) score to quantify annotator consistency using low level image features. SSL is used to predict missing annotations by considering global features and local image consistency. The SC score also serves as the penalty cost in a second order Markov random field (MRF) cost function optimized using graph cuts to derive the final consensus label. Graph cut obtains a global maximum without an iterative procedure. Experimental results on synthetic images, real data of Crohn's disease patients and retinal images show our final segmentation to be accurate and more consistent than competing methods.",['cs.CV']
Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas,We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical imaging that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation. Experimental results show that AGs consistently improve the prediction performance of U-Net across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. The code for the proposed architecture is publicly available.,['cs.CV']
Piecewise Flat Embedding for Image Segmentation,"We introduce a new multi-dimensional nonlinear embedding -- Piecewise Flat Embedding (PFE) -- for image segmentation. Based on the theory of sparse signal recovery, piecewise flat embedding with diverse channels attempts to recover a piecewise constant image representation with sparse region boundaries and sparse cluster value scattering. The resultant piecewise flat embedding exhibits interesting properties such as suppressing slowly varying signals, and offers an image representation with higher region identifiability which is desirable for image segmentation or high-level semantic analysis tasks. We formulate our embedding as a variant of the Laplacian Eigenmap embedding with an $L_{1,p} (0<p\leq1)$ regularization term to promote sparse solutions. First, we devise a two-stage numerical algorithm based on Bregman iterations to compute $L_{1,1}$-regularized piecewise flat embeddings. We further generalize this algorithm through iterative reweighting to solve the general $L_{1,p}$-regularized problem. To demonstrate its efficacy, we integrate PFE into two existing image segmentation frameworks, segmentation based on clustering and hierarchical segmentation based on contour detection. Experiments on four major benchmark datasets, BSDS500, MSRC, Stanford Background Dataset, and PASCAL Context, show that segmentation algorithms incorporating our embedding achieve significantly improved results.","['cs.CV', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']"
Facade Segmentation in the Wild,"Urban facade segmentation from automatically acquired imagery, in contrast to traditional image segmentation, poses several unique challenges. 360-degree photospheres captured from vehicles are an effective way to capture a large number of images, but this data presents difficult-to-model warping and stitching artifacts. In addition, each pixel can belong to multiple facade elements, and different facade elements (e.g., window, balcony, sill, etc.) are correlated and vary wildly in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose three network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel semantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique characteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to assign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank formulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a COMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade element types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities of the various facade element classes. Our results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements over existing facade segmentation approaches for the typical facade elements. For example, on one commonly used dataset, the accuracy scores for window(the most important architectural element) increases from 0.91 to 0.97 percent compared to the best competing method, and comparable improvements on other element types.",['cs.CV']
Interactive Medical Image Segmentation via Point-Based Interaction and Sequential Patch Learning,"Due to low tissue contrast, irregular object appearance, and unpredictable location variation, segmenting the objects from different medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MR) is considered as an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel method for interactive medical image segmentation with the following merits. (1) Our design is fundamentally different from previous pure patch-based and image-based segmentation methods. We observe that during delineation, the physician repeatedly check the inside-outside intensity changing to determine the boundary, which indicates that comparison in an inside-outside manner is extremely important. Thus, we innovatively model our segmentation task as learning the representation of the bi-directional sequential patches, starting from (or ending in) the given central point of the object. This can be realized by our proposed ConvRNN network embedded with a gated memory propagation unit. (2) Unlike previous interactive methods (requiring bounding box or seed points), we only ask the physician to merely click on the rough central point of the object before segmentation, which could simultaneously enhance the performance and reduce the segmentation time. (3) We utilize our method in a multi-level framework for better performance. We systematically evaluate our method in three different segmentation tasks including CT kidney tumor, MR prostate, and PROMISE12 challenge, showing promising results compared with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available here: \href{https://github.com/sunalbert/Sequential-patch-based-segmentation}{Sequential-patch-based-segmentation}.",['cs.CV']
On the iterative refinement of densely connected representation levels for semantic segmentation,"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches increase the receptive field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of poolings/strided convolutions or successive dilated convolutions. However, it is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1) downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3) coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer parameters.",['cs.CV']
Hybrid Forests for Left Ventricle Segmentation using only the first slice label,"Machine learning models produce state-of-the-art results in many MRI images segmentation. However, most of these models are trained on very large datasets which come from experts manual labeling. This labeling process is very time consuming and costs experts work. Therefore finding a way to reduce this cost is on high demand. In this paper, we propose a segmentation method which exploits MRI images sequential structure to nearly drop out this labeling task. Only the first slice needs to be manually labeled to train the model which then infers the next slice's segmentation. Inference result is another datum used to train the model again. The updated model then infers the third slice and the same process is carried out until the last slice. The proposed model is an combination of two Random Forest algorithms: the classical one and a recent one namely Mondrian Forests. We applied our method on human left ventricle segmentation and results are very promising. This method can also be used to generate labels.",['cs.CV']
Stacked U-Nets: A No-Frills Approach to Natural Image Segmentation,"Many imaging tasks require global information about all pixels in an image. Conventional bottom-up classification networks globalize information by decreasing resolution; features are pooled and downsampled into a single output. But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs. To globalize information while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable increase in network size and computational cost. This paper proposes stacked u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution scales while maintaining resolution. SUNets leverage the information globalization power of u-nets in a deeper network architectures that is capable of handling the complexity of natural images. SUNets perform extremely well on semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters.","['cs.CV', 'cs.NE']"
A Multilinear Tongue Model Derived from Speech Related MRI Data of the Human Vocal Tract,"We present a multilinear statistical model of the human tongue that captures anatomical and tongue pose related shape variations separately. The model is derived from 3D magnetic resonance imaging data of 11 speakers sustaining speech related vocal tract configurations. The extraction is performed by using a minimally supervised method that uses as basis an image segmentation approach and a template fitting technique. Furthermore, it uses image denoising to deal with possibly corrupt data, palate surface information reconstruction to handle palatal tongue contacts, and a bootstrap strategy to refine the obtained shapes. Our evaluation concludes that limiting the degrees of freedom for the anatomical and speech related variations to 5 and 4, respectively, produces a model that can reliably register unknown data while avoiding overfitting effects. Furthermore, we show that it can be used to generate a plausible tongue animation by tracking sparse motion capture data.",['cs.CV']
Towards integrating spatial localization in convolutional neural networks for brain image segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an established while rapidly evolving field in medical imaging. In this paper we focus on the segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) into cerebral structures using convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNNs achieve good performance by finding effective high dimensional image features describing the patch content only. In this work, we propose different ways to introduce spatial constraints into the network to further reduce prediction inconsistencies.   A patch based CNN architecture was trained, making use of multiple scales to gather contextual information. Spatial constraints were introduced within the CNN through a distance to landmarks feature or through the integration of a probability atlas. We demonstrate experimentally that using spatial information helps to reduce segmentation inconsistencies.","['cs.CV', 'stat.ML']"
Unsupervised Segmentation of 3D Medical Images Based on Clustering and Deep Representation Learning,"This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances in image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised learning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is challenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical images. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep representation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature representations of training patches from a target image using joint unsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations generated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as supervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D convolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply k-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project cluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented image. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens scanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation of pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the pathological examination process. Hence, we aim to automatically divide each image into the regions of invasive carcinoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and normal tissue. Our experiments show the potential abilities of unsupervised deep representation learning for medical image segmentation.",['cs.CV']

To this end, we study various approaches for transfer learning and apply them to the data set from the 2018 grand challenge on breast cancer histology images (BACH).",['cs.CV']
Application of Superpixels to Segment Several Landmarks in Running Rodents,"Examining locomotion has improved our basic understanding of motor control and aided in treating motor impairment. Mice and rats are the model system of choice for basic neuroscience studies of human disease. High frame rates are needed to quantify the kinematics of running rodents, due to their high stride frequency. Manual tracking, especially for multiple body landmarks, becomes extremely time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the use of superpixels based image segmentation as superpixels utilized both spatial and color information for segmentation. We segmented some parts of body and tested the success of segmentation as a function of color space and SLIC segment size. We used a simple merging function to connect the segmented regions considered as neighbor and having the same intensity value range. In addition, 28 features were extracted, and t-SNE was used to demonstrate how much the methods are capable to differentiate the regions. Finally, we compared the segmented regions to a manually outlined region. The results showed for segmentation, using the RGB image was slightly better compared to the hue channel. For merg- ing and classification, however, the hue representation was better as it captures the relevant color information in a single channel.",['cs.CV']
Compassionately Conservative Balanced Cuts for Image Segmentation,"The Normalized Cut (NCut) objective function, widely used in data clustering and image segmentation, quantifies the cost of graph partitioning in a way that biases clusters or segments that are balanced towards having lower values than unbalanced partitionings. However, this bias is so strong that it avoids any singleton partitions, even when vertices are very weakly connected to the rest of the graph. Motivated by the B\""uhler-Hein family of balanced cut costs, we propose the family of Compassionately Conservative Balanced (CCB) Cut costs, which are indexed by a parameter that can be used to strike a compromise between the desire to avoid too many singleton partitions and the notion that all partitions should be balanced. We show that CCB-Cut minimization can be relaxed into an orthogonally constrained $\ell_{\tau}$-minimization problem that coincides with the problem of computing Piecewise Flat Embeddings (PFE) for one particular index value, and we present an algorithm for solving the relaxed problem by iteratively minimizing a sequence of reweighted Rayleigh quotients (IRRQ). Using images from the BSDS500 database, we show that image segmentation based on CCB-Cut minimization provides better accuracy with respect to ground truth and greater variability in region size than NCut-based image segmentation.",['cs.CV']
Recurrent Segmentation for Variable Computational Budgets,"State-of-the-art systems for semantic image segmentation use feed-forward pipelines with fixed computational costs. Building an image segmentation system that works across a range of computational budgets is challenging and time-intensive as new architectures must be designed and trained for every computational setting. To address this problem we develop a recurrent neural network that successively improves prediction quality with each iteration. Importantly, the RNN may be deployed across a range of computational budgets by merely running the model for a variable number of iterations. We find that this architecture is uniquely suited for efficiently segmenting videos. By exploiting the segmentation of past frames, the RNN can perform video segmentation at similar quality but reduced computational cost compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods. When applied to static images in the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes segmentation datasets, the RNN traces out a speed-accuracy curve that saturates near the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods.",['cs.CV']
IEOPF: An Active Contour Model for Image Segmentation with Inhomogeneities Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions,"Image segmentation is still an open problem especially when intensities of the interested objects are overlapped due to the presence of intensity inhomogeneity (also known as bias field). To segment images with intensity inhomogeneities, a bias correction embedded level set model is proposed where Inhomogeneities are Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions (IEOPF). In the proposed model, the smoothly varying bias is estimated by a linear combination of a given set of orthogonal primary functions. An inhomogeneous intensity clustering energy is then defined and membership functions of the clusters described by the level set function are introduced to rewrite the energy as a data term of the proposed model. Similar to popular level set methods, a regularization term and an arc length term are also included to regularize and smooth the level set function, respectively. The proposed model is then extended to multichannel and multiphase patterns to segment colourful images and images with multiple objects, respectively. It has been extensively tested on both synthetic and real images that are widely used in the literature and public BrainWeb and IBSR datasets. Experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that advantages of the proposed model in terms of bias correction and segmentation accuracy.",['cs.CV']
Long-term Visual Localization using Semantically Segmented Images,"Robust cross-seasonal localization is one of the major challenges in long-term visual navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we exploit recent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is assigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the problem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3-D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.). Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time.",['cs.CV']
Left Ventricle Segmentation in Cardiac MR Images Using Fully Convolutional Network,"Medical image analysis, especially segmenting a specific organ, has an important role in developing clinical decision support systems. In cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, segmenting the left and right ventricles helps physicians diagnose different heart abnormalities. There are challenges for this task, including the intensity and shape similarity between left ventricle and other organs, inaccurate boundaries and presence of noise in most of the images. In this paper we propose an automated method for segmenting the left ventricle in cardiac MR images. We first automatically extract the region of interest, and then employ it as an input of a fully convolutional network. We train the network accurately despite the small number of left ventricle pixels in comparison with the whole image. Thresholding on the output map of the fully convolutional network and selection of regions based on their roundness are performed in our proposed post-processing phase. The Dice score of our method reaches 87.24% by applying this algorithm on the York dataset of heart images.",['cs.CV']
Generative ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (G-SHDL) Network with Structural Priors for Semantic Image Segmentation,"This paper proposes a generative ScatterNet hybrid deep learning (G-SHDL) network for semantic image segmentation. The proposed generative architecture is able to train rapidly from relatively small labeled datasets using the introduced structural priors. In addition, the number of filters in each layer of the architecture is optimized resulting in a computationally efficient architecture. The G-SHDL network produces state-of-the-art classification performance against unsupervised and semi-supervised learning on two image datasets. Advantages of the G-SHDL network over supervised methods are demonstrated with experiments performed on training datasets of reduced size.",['cs.CV']
"Automatic segmenting teeth in X-ray images: Trends, a novel data set, benchmarking and future perspectives","This review presents an in-depth study of the literature on segmentation methods applied in dental imaging. Ten segmentation methods were studied and categorized according to the type of the segmentation method (region-based, threshold-based, cluster-based, boundary-based or watershed-based), type of X-ray images used (intra-oral or extra-oral) and characteristics of the dataset used to evaluate the methods in the state-of-the-art works. We found that the literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%). 80% of the reviewed papers have used intra-oral X-ray images in their experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. To fill a scientific gap in the field, a novel data set based on extra-oral X-ray images are proposed here. A statistical comparison of the results found with the 10 image segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1,500 images is also carried out, providing a more comprehensive source of performance assessment. Discussion on limitations of the methods conceived over the past year as well as future perspectives on exploiting learning-based segmentation methods to improve performance are also provided.",['cs.CV']
Improved Image Segmentation via Cost Minimization of Multiple Hypotheses,"Image segmentation is an important component of many image understanding systems. It aims to group pixels in a spatially and perceptually coherent manner. Typically, these algorithms have a collection of parameters that control the degree of over-segmentation produced. It still remains a challenge to properly select such parameters for human-like perceptual grouping. In this work, we exploit the diversity of segments produced by different choices of parameters. We scan the segmentation parameter space and generate a collection of image segmentation hypotheses (from highly over-segmented to under-segmented). These are fed into a cost minimization framework that produces the final segmentation by selecting segments that: (1) better describe the natural contours of the image, and (2) are more stable and persistent among all the segmentation hypotheses. We compare our algorithm's performance with state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that we can achieve improved results. We also show that our framework is robust to the choice of segmentation kernel that produces the initial set of hypotheses.",['cs.CV']
An Iterative Spanning Forest Framework for Superpixel Segmentation,"Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image processing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF) framework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can choose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an adjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate improved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The superpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those seeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its components. These methods are compared with approaches from the state-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D and 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application, named sky image segmentation. The theoretical properties of ISF are demonstrated in the supplementary material and the results show that some of its methods are competitive with or superior to the best baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.",['cs.CV']
Mix-and-Match Tuning for Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional networks for semantic image segmentation typically require large-scale labeled data, e.g. ImageNet and MS COCO, for network pre-training. To reduce annotation efforts, self-supervised semantic segmentation is recently proposed to pre-train a network without any human-provided labels. The key of this new form of learning is to design a proxy task (e.g. image colorization), from which a discriminative loss can be formulated on unlabeled data. Many proxy tasks, however, lack the critical supervision signals that could induce discriminative representation for the target image segmentation task. Thus self-supervision's performance is still far from that of supervised pre-training. In this study, we overcome this limitation by incorporating a ""mix-and-match"" (M&M) tuning stage in the self-supervision pipeline. The proposed approach is readily pluggable to many self-supervision methods and does not use more annotated samples than the original process. Yet, it is capable of boosting the performance of target image segmentation task to surpass fully-supervised pre-trained counterpart. The improvement is made possible by better harnessing the limited pixel-wise annotations in the target dataset. Specifically, we first introduce the ""mix"" stage, which sparsely samples and mixes patches from the target set to reflect rich and diverse local patch statistics of target images. A ""match"" stage then forms a class-wise connected graph, which can be used to derive a strong triplet-based discriminative loss for fine-tuning the network. Our paradigm follows the standard practice in existing self-supervised studies and no extra data or label is required. With the proposed M&M approach, for the first time, a self-supervision method can achieve comparable or even better performance compared to its ImageNet pre-trained counterpart on both PASCAL VOC2012 dataset and CityScapes dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
TernausNet: U-Net with VGG11 Encoder Pre-Trained on ImageNet for Image Segmentation,"Pixel-wise image segmentation is demanding task in computer vision. Classical U-Net architectures composed of encoders and decoders are very popular for segmentation of medical images, satellite images etc. Typically, neural network initialized with weights from a network pre-trained on a large data set like ImageNet shows better performance than those trained from scratch on a small dataset. In some practical applications, particularly in medicine and traffic safety, the accuracy of the models is of utmost importance. In this paper, we demonstrate how the U-Net type architecture can be improved by the use of the pre-trained encoder. Our code and corresponding pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ternaus/TernausNet. We compare three weight initialization schemes: LeCun uniform, the encoder with weights from VGG11 and full network trained on the Carvana dataset. This network architecture was a part of the winning solution (1st out of 735) in the Kaggle: Carvana Image Masking Challenge.",['cs.CV']
Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation,"In this work, we revisit atrous convolution, a powerful tool to explicitly adjust filter's field-of-view as well as control the resolution of feature responses computed by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, in the application of semantic image segmentation. To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.",['cs.CV']
Revisiting Graph Construction for Fast Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for fast image segmentation. We re-examine the locality-preserving character of spectral clustering by constructing a graph over image regions with both global and local connections. Our novel approach to build graph connections relies on two key observations: 1) local region pairs that co-occur frequently will have a high probability to reside on a common object; 2) spatially distant regions in a common object often exhibit similar visual saliency, which implies their neighborship in a manifold. We present a novel energy function to efficiently conduct graph partitioning. Based on multiple high quality partitions, we show that the generated eigenvector histogram based representation can automatically drive effective unary potentials for a hierarchical random field model to produce multi-class segmentation. Sufficient experiments, on the BSDS500 benchmark, large-scale PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, demonstrate the competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improved efficiency of our proposed method compared with other state of the arts.",['cs.CV']
Splenomegaly Segmentation using Global Convolutional Kernels and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Spleen volume estimation using automated image segmentation technique may be used to detect splenomegaly (abnormally enlarged spleen) on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. In recent years, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) segmentation methods have demonstrated advantages for abdominal organ segmentation. However, variations in both size and shape of the spleen on MRI images may result in large false positive and false negative labeling when deploying DCNN based methods. In this paper, we propose the Splenomegaly Segmentation Network (SSNet) to address spatial variations when segmenting extraordinarily large spleens. SSNet was designed based on the framework of image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Specifically, the Global Convolutional Network (GCN) was used as the generator to reduce false negatives, while the Markovian discriminator (PatchGAN) was used to alleviate false positives. A cohort of clinically acquired 3D MRI scans (both T1 weighted and T2 weighted) from patients with splenomegaly were used to train and test the networks. The experimental results demonstrated that a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9260 and a median Dice coefficient of 0.9262 using SSNet on independently tested MRI volumes of patients with splenomegaly.",['cs.CV']
Real-time Semantic Image Segmentation via Spatial Sparsity,"We propose an approach to semantic (image) segmentation that reduces the computational costs by a factor of 25 with limited impact on the quality of results. Semantic segmentation has a number of practical applications, and for most such applications the computational costs are critical. The method follows a typical two-column network structure, where one column accepts an input image, while the other accepts a half-resolution version of that image. By identifying specific regions in the full-resolution image that can be safely ignored, as well as carefully tailoring the network structure, we can process approximately 15 highresolution Cityscapes images (1024x2048) per second using a single GTX 980 video card, while achieving a mean intersection-over-union score of 72.9% on the Cityscapes test set.",['cs.CV']
VisDA: The Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge,"We present the 2017 Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) dataset and challenge, a large-scale testbed for unsupervised domain adaptation across visual domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to solve the real-world problem of domain shift, where machine learning models trained on one domain must be transferred and adapted to a novel visual domain without additional supervision. The VisDA2017 challenge is focused on the simulation-to-reality shift and has two associated tasks: image classification and image segmentation. The goal in both tracks is to first train a model on simulated, synthetic data in the source domain and then adapt it to perform well on real image data in the unlabeled test domain. Our dataset is the largest one to date for cross-domain object classification, with over 280K images across 12 categories in the combined training, validation and testing domains. The image segmentation dataset is also large-scale with over 30K images across 18 categories in the three domains. We compare VisDA to existing cross-domain adaptation datasets and provide a baseline performance analysis using various domain adaptation models that are currently popular in the field.",['cs.CV']
Fast Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks for Direct Perception in Autonomous Driving,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform extremely well at a variety of tasks including subtasks of autonomous driving such as image segmentation and object classification. However, networks designed for these tasks typically require vast quantities of training data and long training periods to converge. We investigate the design rationale behind end-to-end driving network designs by proposing and comparing three small and computationally inexpensive deep end-to-end neural network models that generate driving control signals directly from input images. In contrast to prior work that segments the autonomous driving task, our models take on a novel approach to the autonomous driving problem by utilizing deep and thin Fully Convolutional Nets (FCNs) with recurrent neural nets and low parameter counts to tackle a complex end-to-end regression task predicting both steering and acceleration commands. In addition, we include layers optimized for classification to allow the networks to implicitly learn image semantics. We show that the resulting networks use 3x fewer parameters than the most recent comparable end-to-end driving network and 500x fewer parameters than the AlexNet variations and converge both faster and to lower losses while maintaining robustness against overfitting.",['cs.CV']
DLTK: State of the Art Reference Implementations for Deep Learning on Medical Images,"We present DLTK, a toolkit providing baseline implementations for efficient experimentation with deep learning methods on biomedical images. It builds on top of TensorFlow and its high modularity and easy-to-use examples allow for a low-threshold access to state-of-the-art implementations for typical medical imaging problems. A comparison of DLTK's reference implementations of popular network architectures for image segmentation demonstrates new top performance on the publicly available challenge data ""Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault"". The average test Dice similarity coefficient of $81.5$ exceeds the previously best performing CNN ($75.7$) and the accuracy of the challenge winning method ($79.0$).","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
Segmenting Brain Tumors with Symmetry,"We explore encoding brain symmetry into a neural network for a brain tumor segmentation task. A healthy human brain is symmetric at a high level of abstraction, and the high-level asymmetric parts are more likely to be tumor regions. Paying more attention to asymmetries has the potential to boost the performance in brain tumor segmentation. We propose a method to encode brain symmetry into existing neural networks and apply the method to a state-of-the-art neural network for medical imaging segmentation. We evaluate our symmetry-encoded network on the dataset from a brain tumor segmentation challenge and verify that the new model extracts information in the training images more efficiently than the original model.",['cs.CV']
3D Randomized Connection Network with Graph-based Label Inference,"In this paper, a novel 3D deep learning network is proposed for brain MR image segmentation with randomized connection, which can decrease the dependency between layers and increase the network capacity. The convolutional LSTM and 3D convolution are employed as network units to capture the long-term and short-term 3D properties respectively. To assemble these two kinds of spatial-temporal information and refine the deep learning outcomes, we further introduce an efficient graph-based node selection and label inference method. Experiments have been carried out on two publicly available databases and results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain competitive performances as compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",['cs.CV']
A deep learning model integrating FCNNs and CRFs for brain tumor segmentation,"Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation is a critical component in cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.",['cs.CV']
The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions.   Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train.   In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.   Code to reproduce the experiments is available here : https://github.com/SimJeg/FC-DenseNet/blob/master/train.py",['cs.CV']
Historical Document Image Segmentation with LDA-Initialized Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform deep neural networks layer-wise weight initialization using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Typically, the weights of a deep neural network are initialized with: random values, greedy layer-wise pre-training (usually as Deep Belief Network or as auto-encoder) or by re-using the layers from another network (transfer learning). Hence, many training epochs are needed before meaningful weights are learned, or a rather similar dataset is required for seeding a fine-tuning of transfer learning. In this paper, we describe how to turn an LDA into either a neural layer or a classification layer. We analyze the initialization technique on historical documents. First, we show that an LDA-based initialization is quick and leads to a very stable initialization. Furthermore, for the task of layout analysis at pixel level, we investigate the effectiveness of LDA-based initialization and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art random weight initialization methods.",['cs.CV']
Interactive Medical Image Segmentation using Deep Learning with Image-specific Fine-tuning,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they have not demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes. To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for interactive segmentation by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine-tuning to make a CNN model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised (without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and interaction-based uncertainty for the fine-tuning. We applied this framework to two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal MR slices, where only two types of these organs were annotated for training; and 3D segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor (including edema) from different MR sequences, where only tumor cores in one MR sequence were annotated for training. Experimental results show that 1) our model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art CNNs; 2) image-specific fine-tuning with the proposed weighted loss function significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than traditional interactive segmentation methods.",['cs.CV']
Fast Barcode Retrieval for Consensus Contouring,"Marking tumors and organs is a challenging task suffering from both inter- and intra-observer variability. The literature quantifies observer variability by generating consensus among multiple experts when they mark the same image. Automatically building consensus contours to establish quality assurance for image segmentation is presently absent in the clinical practice. As the \emph{big data} becomes more and more available, techniques to access a large number of existing segments of multiple experts becomes possible. Fast algorithms are, hence, required to facilitate the search for similar cases. The present work puts forward a potential framework that tested with small datasets (both synthetic and real images) displays the reliability of finding similar images. In this paper, the idea of content-based barcodes is used to retrieve similar cases in order to build consensus contours in medical image segmentation. This approach may be regarded as an extension of the conventional atlas-based segmentation that generally works with rather small atlases due to required computational expenses. The fast segment-retrieval process via barcodes makes it possible to create and use large atlases, something that directly contributes to the quality of the consensus building. Because the accuracy of experts' contours must be measured, we first used 500 synthetic prostate images with their gold markers and delineations by 20 simulated users. The fast barcode-guided computed consensus delivered an average error of $8\%\!\pm\!5\%$ compared against the gold standard segments. Furthermore, we used magnetic resonance images of prostates from 15 patients delineated by 5 oncologists and selected the best delineations to serve as the gold-standard segments. The proposed barcode atlas achieved a Jaccard overlap of $87\%\!\pm\!9\%$ with the contours of the gold-standard segments.",['cs.CV']
Neural networks for topology optimization,"In this research, we propose a deep learning based approach for speeding up the topology optimization methods. The problem we seek to solve is the layout problem. The main novelty of this work is to state the problem as an image segmentation task. We leverage the power of deep learning methods as the efficient pixel-wise image labeling technique to perform the topology optimization. We introduce convolutional encoder-decoder architecture and the overall approach of solving the above-described problem with high performance. The conducted experiments demonstrate the significant acceleration of the optimization process. The proposed approach has excellent generalization properties. We demonstrate the ability of the application of the proposed model to other problems. The successful results, as well as the drawbacks of the current method, are discussed.",['cs.LG']
Learning to Label Affordances from Simulated and Real Data,"An autonomous robot should be able to evaluate the affordances that are offered by a given situation. Here we address this problem by designing a system that can densely predict affordances given only a single 2D RGB image. This is achieved with a convolutional neural network (ResNet), which we combine with refinement modules recently proposed for addressing semantic image segmentation. We define a novel cost function, which is able to handle (potentially multiple) affordances of objects and their parts in a pixel-wise manner even in the case of incomplete data. We perform qualitative as well as quantitative evaluations with simulated and real data assessing 15 different affordances. In general, we find that affordances, which are well-enough represented in the training data, are correctly recognized with a substantial fraction of correctly assigned pixels. Furthermore, we show that our model outperforms several baselines. Hence, this method can give clear action guidelines for a robot.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']"
3D Densely Convolutional Networks for Volumetric Segmentation,"In the isointense stage, the accurate volumetric image segmentation is a challenging task due to the low contrast between tissues. In this paper, we propose a novel very deep network architecture based on a densely convolutional network for volumetric brain segmentation. The proposed network architecture provides a dense connection between layers that aims to improve the information flow in the network. By concatenating features map of fine and coarse dense blocks, it allows capturing multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed method over existing methods, in terms of both segmentation accuracy and parameter efficiency in MICCAI grand challenge on 6-month infant brain MRI segmentation.",['cs.CV']
UI-Net: Interactive Artificial Neural Networks for Iterative Image Segmentation Based on a User Model,"For complex segmentation tasks, fully automatic systems are inherently limited in their achievable accuracy for extracting relevant objects. Especially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly accurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit for the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an intervention for a single patient. We propose a learning-based cooperative segmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user into the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional artificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training. During the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively add additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN system to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The segmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches can yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel component, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each interaction.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']"
One-Shot Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Low-shot learning methods for image classification support learning from sparse data. We extend these techniques to support dense semantic image segmentation. Specifically, we train a network that, given a small set of annotated images, produces parameters for a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We use this FCN to perform dense pixel-level prediction on a test image for the new semantic class. Our architecture shows a 25% relative meanIoU improvement compared to the best baseline methods for one-shot segmentation on unseen classes in the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and is at least 3 times faster.",['cs.CV']
