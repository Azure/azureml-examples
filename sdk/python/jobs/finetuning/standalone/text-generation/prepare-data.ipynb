    "### 1. Pick the dataset for fine-tuning the model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [samsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset. The next few cells show basic data preparation for fine tuning:\n",
    "* Visualize some data rows\n",
    "* Preprocess the data and format it in required format. This is an important step for performing text completion as we add the required sequences/separators in the data. This is how we repurpose the text-completion task to any specific task like summarization, translation, text-completion, etc.\n",
    "* While fintuning, text column is concatenated with ground_truth column to produce finetuning input. Hence, the data should be prepared such that `text + ground_truth` is your actual finetuning data.\n",
    "* bos and eos tokens are added to the data by finetuning pipeline, you do not need to add it explicitly \n",
    "* We want this sample to run quickly, so save smaller `train`, `validation` and `test` files containing 10% of the original. This means the fine tuned model will have lower accuracy, hence it should not be put to real-world use. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Here is an example of how the data should look like\n",
    "\n",
    "text completion requires the training data to include at least 2 fields – one for ‘text’ and ‘ground_truth’ like in this example. The below examples are from Samsum dataset. \n",
