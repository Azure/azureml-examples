Since my parents\u2019 house is so far away, I need to find an apartment closer to school.

If you have something that will allow me to get paid for my work and will be in line with my experience, that'd be absolutely wonderful.\r\nDiana: I'm open for being a volunteer as well - the only problem's that I may not be able to afford to pay for the accommodation.\r\nChris: Most of the organisations we're cooperating with cover the cost of the accommodation of our volunteers.

I was just talking with my friends (Alex Rafferty and Natalie Simpson), with whom I'm arriving with, whether there is an option to not take part in the activitiy with the costumes, and just take part for the rest of the party. I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience.\r\nAurore: Hello... hmmm, well the initial plan was to start with the costumes and that will definitely take over an hour. Of course, there will be other dances and games, but that was ment to be the main event... Are you sure you don't want to take part?\r\nAurore: I'm sorry that I haven't sent you the descriptions of your characters, but I can quickly summarise what part each of you would play (even for Natalie)... What exactly do you not like in this activity?\r\nAurore: Okay, you know what - I've thought things through. I won't send you your character descriptions - I guess while that event is taking place, you'll have to be next door (there are board games & films, so you should be entertained). Then, when the costume activity has ended (which I would like to point out, doesn't depend on me but on the participants of said activity), you can rejoin us.\r\nJulia: Well, we don't exactly understand what the game is... Is it something similar to charades?\r\nAurore: No!! Absolutely not!!! I wrote a detailed description of the game a while back, let me see if I can resend you the email.\r\nAurore: <file_other>\r\nJulia: Wow, it looks really cool! :) I'll try to convince the girls to stay.\r\nAurore: That's the thing - because of so many changes: people signing up at the last minute, other people cancelling, not to mention the nature of this game and how close it is to the new years, I don't have time to send you detailed descriptions of your characters until new year's eve, which might not be enough time for you to prepare.\r\nJulia: Oh, in that case - we'll stay by the board games. I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused you and thank you for explaining everything.\r\nAurore: It's okay (nature of the job, I suppose). But are you sure? Because like I wrote earlier, I do have characters for you if you like.\r\nJulia: We're sure. Thank you! The game sounds amazing!\n---\nSummary:\n","ground_truth":"Julia, Alex Rafferty and Natalie Simpson will not be joining Aurore in the game.

The type of the machine greatly depends on your built and how much many you would like to spend.\nJohn: My budget is quite limited as is the space in my living room\u2026\nMichael: I\u2019d advise you to first measure the room to know how big the machine can actually be for you to exercise comfortably and effectively.\nTom: Waste of money, most expensive cloth hanger\nJohn: Hahaha, I hope it won\u2019t be in my case. I\u2019m quite determined to lose some weight. I\u2019m tall and a bit overweight, so I worry that I may break the machine\nAnna: Don\u2019t worry about that. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but have a look at the specs just in case.\nMichael: When it comes to the price, cheaper models don\u2019t have as many electronic options as the more expensive do, but I\u2019d advise you to invest in it if you\u2019re being serious about losing weight.\nJohn: Why\u2019s that?\nMichael: You can always exercise with your phone and an app, but it\u2019s not the most comfortable way (tried it myself). It\u2019s good to have at least three preinstalled programmes like weight-loss, interval, etc. Then the machine will think for you.\nAnna: My first cross trainer didn\u2019t have such options and I must admit that I was also training with my phone and keeping my times. Now, when the old broke, I bought a \u201cfancier\u201d model and I definitely don\u2019t regret it\nJohn: Do you have any company you can recommend? Or a specific model?\nSusan: I have OBE8731 Powerstride 18\" Rear Drive and I think it\u2019s ok.\nAnna: I think that in case of cross trainer it really goes down to the price range. You won\u2019t be able to buy a really good equipment cheaply.\nMichael: I agree, especially if you\u2019re determined and interested in your scores. It may sound silly, but I think tracking your progress helps to lose weight.\nJohn: Thank you so much for your advice! I can\u2019t spend too much, but I don\u2019t want to throw my money away on something that won\u2019t serve me\u2026\nAnna: Sure, again, in my opinion it is a thing worth investing in. Look up some tutorials and exercise plans in Google, it will also help you out to achieve your goal.\nMichael: Good luck!\n---\nSummary:\n","ground_truth":"John wants to buy a cross trainer but he has both a limited budget and space for it.

Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters.

In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +\/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100\u20ac, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130\u20ac a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can.

Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.\r\nJoddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.\r\nMousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.\r\nMousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society.
