SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is necessary to provide assistance to low-income utility customers to make sure they can afford to pay their energy bills.
(b) Programs that reduce the costs of the energy utilities’ California Alternate Rates for Energy, or CARE, program can support the long-term ability of the CARE program to meet the needs of low-income customers.
(c) Installing qualifying solar energy systems in disadvantaged communities can provide local economic development benefits while advancing the state’s renewable energy policies and policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
(d) The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan and Communities Revitalization Act (Chapter 4.1 (commencing with Section 39710) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code) requires that a minimum of 25 percent of the available moneys in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund be allocated to projects that provide benefits to disadvantaged communities and 10 percent fund projects in disadvantaged communities.
(e) It is the goal of the state to make qualifying solar energy systems more accessible to low-income and disadvantaged communities and, as in the case of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, to install those systems in a manner that represents the geographic diversity of the state.
(f) It is the goal of the state to install qualifying solar energy systems that have a generating capacity equivalent to at least 300 megawatts for the express purpose of lowering the energy bills of tenants at low-income multifamily housing.

Section 748.5 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
748.5.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), the commission shall require revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electric utilities pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 95890 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations to be credited directly to the residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers of the electrical corporation.
(b) Not later than January 1, 2013, the commission shall require the adoption and implementation of a customer outreach plan for each electrical corporation, including, but not limited to, such measures as notices in bills and through media outlets, for purposes of obtaining the maximum feasible public awareness of the crediting of greenhouse gas allowance revenues. Costs associated with the implementation of this plan are subject to recovery in rates pursuant to Section 454.
(c) The commission may allocate up to 15 percent of the revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical distribution utilities pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 95890 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, for clean energy and energy efficiency projects established pursuant to statute that are administered by the electrical corporation, or a qualified third-party administrator as approved by the commission, and that are not otherwise funded by another funding source.
SEC. 3.
Chapter 9.5 (commencing with Section 2870) is added to Part 2 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code, to read:
CHAPTER  9.5. Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program

(4) “Solar energy system” means a solar energy photovoltaic device that meets or exceeds the eligibility criteria established pursuant to Section 25782 of the Public Resources Code.
(b) (1) Adoption and implementation of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program may count toward the satisfaction of the commission’s obligation to ensure that specific alternatives designed for growth among residential customers in disadvantaged communities are offered as part of the standard contract or tariff authorized pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 2827.1.
(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude electrical corporations from offering and administering a distributed energy resource program, including solar energy systems, in disadvantaged communities offered under current or proposed programs using funds provided under subdivision (c) of Section 748.5 or programs proposed to comply with paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) as approved by the commission.
(c) The commission shall annually authorize the allocation of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) or 10 percent of available funds, whichever is less, from the revenues described in subdivision (c) of Section 748.5 for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016, and ending with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The commission shall continue authorizing the allocation of these funds through June 30, 2026, if the commission determines that revenues are available after 2020 and that there is adequate interest and participation in the program.
(d) The commission shall consider the most appropriate program administration structure, including administration by a qualified third-party administrator, selected by the commission through a competitive bidding process, or administration by an electrical corporation, in an existing or future proceeding.
(e) Not more than 10 percent of the funds allocated to the program shall be used for administration.
(f) (1) By June 30, 2017, the commission shall authorize the award of monetary incentives for qualifying solar energy systems that are installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties through December 31, 2030. The target of the program is to install a combined generating capacity of at least 300 megawatts on qualified properties.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. That act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020, equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. The state board is authorized to include market-based compliance mechanisms to comply with the regulations. The implementing regulations adopted by the state board provide for the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical corporations pursuant to a market-based compliance mechanism.
Existing law authorizes the commission to allocate 15% of these revenues for clean energy and energy efficiency projects established pursuant to statute that are administered by electrical corporations and requires the commission to direct the balance of the revenues to be credited directly to the residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers of the electrical corporations, as specified.
This bill would authorize a qualified 3rd-party administrator to administer the clean energy and energy efficiency projects.
Existing law requires the commission to ensure that not less than 10% of the funds for the California Solar Initiative are utilized for the installation of solar energy systems, as defined, on low-income residential housing, as defined. Pursuant to this requirement, the commission adopted decisions that established the Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes Program and the Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing Program, pursuant to which the electrical corporations provide monetary incentives for the installation of solar energy systems on low-income residential housing.
This bill would require the commission to annually authorize the allocation of $100,000,000 or 10% of available funds, whichever is less, beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016, and ending with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, from the greenhouse gas allowance revenues received by electrical corporations set aside for clean energy and energy efficiency projects for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, which the bill would create. The bill would require the commission to consider the most appropriate program administration, as specified, with not more than 10% of the allocated funds to be used for administration. The bill would require the commission to authorize, by June 30, 2017, the award of monetary incentives for solar energy systems, as defined, that are installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties, as defined, through December 31, 2030, with the target of the program being to install a combined generating capacity of at least 300 megawatts on qualified properties. The bill would require the commission to require that the electricity generated by qualifying solar energy systems installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties pursuant to the program be primarily used to offset electricity usage by low-income tenants. The bill would require that low-income tenants receive credits on utility bills from the program through tariffs that allow for the allocation of credits, as specified. The bill would require the commission, on or before July 30, 2020, and by July 30 of every third year thereafter through 2029, to submit an assessment, as specified, to the Legislature of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program.
Existing law makes any public utility and any corporation or person other than a public utility that violates any part of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission guilty of a crime.
Because the provisions of this bill require action by the commission to implement its requirements, a violation of these commission-ordered requirements would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 748.5 of, and to add Chapter 9.5 (commencing with Section 2870) to Part 2 of Division 1 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) According to a Kaiser Family Foundation study, California’s seniors have the nation’s highest poverty rate.
(2) Twenty percent of California adults over 65 years of age live below the poverty threshold of about $16,000, when the higher cost of housing and health care are taken into account.
(3) Nationally, homelessness among seniors is projected to rise by 33 percent between 2010 and 2020, and by 100 percent between 2010 and 2050, according to a 2010 report from the Homelessness Research Institute.
(4) The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority reports that from 2011 to 2013, inclusive, Los Angeles County had a 29.1 percent increase in the number of homeless people 62 years of age and older.
(5) According to a March 2013 report of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, California is the second least affordable state behind Hawaii.
(6) According to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, fair market rent in California for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,341 a month. In order to afford this level of rent and utilities, without paying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household needs to earn $4,470 monthly or $53,640 annually.
(7) Three out of the 10 most expensive metropolitan areas and six out of the 10 most expensive counties nationally are in California.
(8) In order to slow the growing numbers of homeless senior citizens being priced out of their homes, California must begin to explore practical means to slow this disaster.
(b) The Legislature hereby enacts this act to test if the personal income tax credit described in Section 17053 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is a viable method to help low-income California senior renters remain in their homes.
SEC. 2.
Section 17053 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read:
17053.
(a) For each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2019, there shall be allowed as a credit against the “net tax,” as defined in Section 17039, an amount equal to the increase in rent of a qualified residence for the taxable year compared to the previous taxable year that is paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer.
(b) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Qualified taxpayer” means a person with all of the following characteristics:
(A) He or she is 62 years of age or older.
(B) He or she rents a qualified residence as his or her primary residence, he or she is named on the lease for that residence, and he or she has rented that residence for a period of 12 months or more.
(C) His or her combined annual household income is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less, more than one-third of which is spent on rent.
(2) “Qualifying residence” means a property that is located in the County of Alameda, the City and County of San Francisco, the County of Ventura, and the County of Santa Clara.
(c) In the case where the credit allowed by this section exceeds the “net tax,” the excess may be carried over to reduce the “net tax” in the following year, and succeeding seven years, if necessary, until the total credit is exhausted.
(d) A credit shall not be allowed under this section if a renter’s credit has been claimed by a taxpayer pursuant to Section 17053.5.
(e) This section shall remain in effect only until December 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed.

(B) If, when, and during those times that the United States government increases or decreases its contributions in assistance of needy children in this state above or below the amount paid on July 1, 1972, the amounts specified in the above table shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to that increase or decrease by the United States government, provided that no increase or decrease shall be subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section 11453.
(2) The sums specified in paragraph (1) shall not be adjusted for cost of living for the 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1995–96, 1996–97, and 1997–98 fiscal years, and through October 31, 1998, nor shall that amount be included in the base for calculating any cost-of-living increases for any fiscal year thereafter. Elimination of the cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the requirements of
former
Section 11453.05, and no further reduction shall be made pursuant to that section.
(b) (1) When the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid under this chapter, aid shall be paid to a pregnant child who is 18 years of age or younger at any time after verification of pregnancy, in the amount that would otherwise be paid to one person, as specified in subdivision (a), if the child and her child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. Verification of pregnancy shall be required as a condition of eligibility for aid under this subdivision.
(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the family does not include a needy child qualified for aid under this chapter, aid shall be paid to a pregnant woman for the month in which the birth is anticipated and for the six-month period immediately prior to the month in which the birth is anticipated, in the amount that would otherwise be paid to one person, as specified in subdivision (a), if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. Verification of pregnancy shall be required as a condition of eligibility for aid under this subdivision.
(3) Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Cal-Learn Program is operative.
(c) The amount of forty-seven dollars ($47) per month shall be paid to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) or (b) to meet special needs resulting from pregnancy if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter. County welfare departments shall refer all recipients of aid under this subdivision to a local provider of the Women, Infants, and Children program. If that payment to pregnant women qualified for aid under subdivision (a) is considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, payments under this subdivision shall not apply to persons eligible under subdivision (a), except for the month in which birth is anticipated and for the three-month period immediately prior to the month in which delivery is anticipated, if the woman and child, if born, would have qualified for aid under this chapter.
(d) For children receiving AFDC-FC under this chapter, there shall be paid, exclusive of any amount considered exempt as income, an amount of aid each month that, when added to the child’s income, is equal to the rate specified in Section 11460, 11461, 11462, 11462.1, or 11463. In addition, the child shall be eligible for special needs, as specified in departmental regulations.
(e) In addition to the amounts payable under subdivision (a) and Section 11453.1, a family shall be entitled to receive an allowance for recurring special needs not common to a majority of recipients. These recurring special needs shall include, but not be limited to, special diets upon the recommendation of a physician for circumstances other than pregnancy, and unusual costs of transportation, laundry, housekeeping services, telephone, and utilities. The recurring special needs allowance for each family per month shall not exceed that amount resulting from multiplying the sum of ten dollars ($10) by the number of recipients in the family who are eligible for assistance.
(f) After a family has used all available liquid resources, both exempt and nonexempt, in excess of one hundred dollars ($100), with the exception of funds deposited in a restricted account described in subdivision (a) of Section 11155.2, the family shall also be entitled to receive an allowance for nonrecurring special needs.
(1) An allowance for nonrecurring special needs shall be granted for replacement of clothing and household equipment and for emergency housing needs other than those needs addressed by paragraph (2). These needs shall be caused by sudden and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the needy family. The department shall establish the allowance for each of the nonrecurring special needs items. The sum of all nonrecurring special needs provided by this subdivision shall not exceed six hundred dollars ($600) per event.
(2) (A) Homeless assistance is available to a homeless family seeking shelter when the family is eligible for aid under this chapter. Homeless assistance for temporary shelter is also available to homeless families that are apparently eligible for aid under this chapter. Apparent eligibility exists when evidence presented by the applicant, or that is otherwise available to the county welfare department, and the information provided on the application documents indicate that there would be eligibility for aid under this chapter if the evidence and information were verified. However, an alien applicant who does not provide verification of his or her eligible alien status, or a woman with no eligible children who does not provide medical verification of pregnancy, is not apparently eligible for purposes of this section.
(B) A family is considered homeless, for the purpose of this section, when the family lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence;
or
the family has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations; or the family is residing in a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A family is also considered homeless for the purpose of this section if the family has received a notice to pay rent or quit. The family shall demonstrate that the eviction is the result of a verified financial hardship as a result of extraordinary circumstances beyond their control, and not other lease or rental violations, and that the family is experiencing a financial crisis that could result in homelessness if preventative assistance is not provided.
(A) (i) A nonrecurring special needs benefit of sixty-five dollars ($65) a day shall be available to families of up to four members for the costs of temporary shelter, subject to the requirements of this paragraph. The fifth and additional members of the family shall each receive fifteen dollars ($15) per day, up to a daily maximum of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125). County welfare departments may increase the daily amount available for temporary shelter as necessary to secure the additional bedspace needed by the family.
(ii) This special needs benefit shall be granted or denied immediately upon the family’s application for homeless assistance, and benefits shall be available for up to three working days. The county welfare department shall verify the family’s homelessness within the first three working days and if the family meets the criteria of questionable homelessness established by the department, the county welfare department shall refer the family to its early fraud prevention and detection unit, if the county has such a unit, for assistance in the verification of homelessness within this period.
(iii) After homelessness has been verified, the three-day limit shall be extended for a period of time which, when added to the initial benefits provided, does not exceed a total of 16 calendar days. This extension of benefits shall be done in increments of one week and shall be based upon searching for permanent housing which shall be documented on a housing search form, good cause, or other circumstances defined by the department. Documentation of a housing search shall be required for the initial extension of benefits beyond the three-day limit and on a weekly basis thereafter as long as the family is receiving temporary shelter benefits. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, situations in which the county welfare department has determined that the family, to the extent it is capable, has made a good faith but unsuccessful effort to secure permanent housing while receiving temporary shelter benefits.
(B) (i) A nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is available to pay for last month’s rent and security deposits when these payments are reasonable conditions of securing a residence, or to pay for up to two months of rent arrearages, when these payments are a reasonable condition of preventing eviction.
(ii) The last month’s rent or monthly arrearage portion of the payment (I) shall not exceed 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size and (II) shall only be made to families that have found permanent housing costing no more than 80 percent of the family’s total monthly household income without the value of CalFresh benefits or special needs benefit for a family of that size.
(iii) However, if the county welfare department determines that a family intends to reside with individuals who will be sharing housing costs, the county welfare department shall, in appropriate circumstances, set aside the condition specified in subclause (II) of clause (ii).
(C) The nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is also available to cover the standard costs of deposits for utilities which are necessary for the health and safety of the family.
(D) A payment for
,
or denial of
,
permanent housing assistance shall be issued no later than one working day from the time that a family presents evidence of the availability of permanent housing. If an applicant family provides evidence of the availability of permanent housing before the county welfare department has established eligibility for aid under this chapter, the county welfare department shall complete the eligibility determination so that the
denial of or

SECTION 1.
Section 51203 of the Government Code is amended to read:
51203.
(a) The assessor shall determine the current fair market value of the land as if it were free of the contractual restriction pursuant to Section 51283. The Department of Conservation or the landowner, also referred to in this section as “parties,” may provide information to assist the assessor to determine the value. Any information provided to the assessor shall be served on the other party, unless the information was provided at the request of the assessor, and would be confidential under law if required of an assessee.
(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessor’s notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4, if the Department of Conservation or the landowner believes that the current fair market valuation certified pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4 is not accurate, the department or the landowner may request formal review from the county assessor in the county considering the petition to cancel the contract. The department or the landowner shall submit to the assessor and the other party the reasons for believing the valuation is not accurate and the additional information the requesting party believes may substantiate a recalculation of the property valuation. The assessor may recover his or her reasonable costs of the formal review from the party requesting the review, and may provide an estimate of those costs to the requesting party. The recovery of these costs from the department may be deducted by the city or county from cancellation fees received pursuant to this chapter prior to transmittal to the Controller for deposit in the Soil Conservation Fund. The assessor may require a deposit from the landowner to cover the contingency that payment of a cancellation fee will not necessarily result from the completion of a formal review. This subdivision shall not be construed as a limitation on the authority provided in Section 51287 for cities or counties to recover their costs in the cancellation process, except that the assessor’s costs of conducting a formal review shall not be borne by the nonrequesting party.
(1) If no request is made within 45 days of receiving notice by certified mail of the valuation, the assessor’s valuation shall be used to calculate the fee.
(2) Upon receiving a request for formal review, the assessor shall formally review his or her valuation if, based on the determination of the assessor, the information may have a material effect on valuation of the property. The assessor shall notify the parties that the formal review is being undertaken and that information to aid the assessor’s review shall be submitted within 30 days of the date of the notice to the parties. Any information submitted to the assessor shall be served on the other party who shall have 30 days to respond to that information to the assessor. If the response to the assessor contains new information, the party receiving that response shall have 20 days to respond to the assessor as to the new information. All submittals and responses to the assessor shall be served on the other party by personal service or an affidavit of mailing. The assessor shall avoid ex parte contacts during the formal review and shall report any such contacts to the department and the landowner at the same time the review is complete. The assessor shall complete the review no later than 120 days of receiving the request.
(3) At the conclusion of the formal review, the assessor shall either revise the cancellation valuation or determine that the original cancellation valuation is accurate. The assessor shall send the revised valuation or notice of the determination that the valuation is accurate to the department, the landowner, and the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract. The assessor shall include a brief narrative of what consideration was given to the items of information and responses directly relating to the cancellation value submitted by the parties. The assessor shall give no consideration to a party’s information or response that was not served on the other party. If the assessor denies a formal review, a brief narrative shall be provided to the parties indicating the basis for the denial, if requested.
(c) For purposes of this section, the valuation date of any revised valuation pursuant to formal review or following judicial challenge shall remain the date of the assessor’s initial valuation, or his or her initial recomputation pursuant to Section 51283.4. For purposes of cancellation fee calculation in a tentative cancellation as provided in Section 51283, or in a recomputation for final cancellation as provided in Section 51283.4, a cancellation value shall be considered current for one year after its determination and certification by the assessor.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department and the landowner may agree on a cancellation valuation of the land. The agreed valuation shall serve as the cancellation valuation pursuant to Section 51283 or Section 51283.4. The agreement shall be transmitted to the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract.
(e) If a contract with a city or county includes an additional cancellation fee pursuant to Section 51240, the department shall provide a preliminary valuation to the county assessor of the county in which the land is located and the board of supervisors or the city council at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the final cancellation valuation pursuant to subdivision (d). The preliminary valuation shall include a description of the rationale and facts considered by the department in determining the cancellation value. The assessor may provide comments on the preliminary valuation to the board of supervisors or city council. The board of supervisors or city council may provide comments on the preliminary valuation and cancellation value, if submitted, to the department. Prior to determining the final cancellation valuation, the department shall consider the comments of the board or council concerning the preliminary valuation and cancellation valuation, if submitted.
(f) This section represents the exclusive administrative procedure for appealing a cancellation valuation calculated pursuant to this section. The Department of Conservation shall represent the interests of the state in the administrative and judicial remedies for challenging the determination of a cancellation valuation or cancellation fee.","Existing law establishes the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, otherwise known as the Williamson Act, and authorizes a city or county to enter into 10-year contracts with owners of land devoted to agricultural use, whereby the owners agree to continue using the property for that purpose, and the city or county agrees to value the land accordingly for purposes of property taxation, as specified. Existing law provides for the procedure to cancel a contract entered into under these provisions, and provides that the landowner and the Department of Conservation may agree on the cancellation value of the land.
This bill would require the department to provide a preliminary valuation of the land to the county assessor and the city council or board of supervisors at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the agreed upon cancellation valuation if the contract includes an additional cancellation fee, as specified.","An act to amend Section 51203 of the Government Code, relating to local government."

(b) Except as provided in Sections 65995.5 and 65995.7, the amount of any fees, charges, dedications, or other requirements authorized under Section 17620 of the Education Code, or pursuant to Chapter 4.7 (commencing with Section 65970), or both, shall not exceed the following:
(1) In the case of residential construction, including the location, installation, or occupancy of manufactured homes and mobilehomes, one dollar and ninety-three cents ($1.93) per square foot of assessable space. “Assessable space,” for this purpose, means all of the square footage within the perimeter of a residential structure, not including any carport, covered or uncovered walkway, garage, overhang, patio, enclosed patio, detached accessory structure, or similar area. The amount of the square footage within the perimeter of a residential structure shall be calculated by the building department of the city or county issuing the building permit, in accordance with the standard practice of that city or county in calculating structural perimeters. “Manufactured home” and “mobilehome” have the meanings set forth in subdivision (f) of Section 17625 of the Education Code. The application of any fee, charge, dedication, or other form of requirement to the location, installation, or occupancy of manufactured homes and mobilehomes is subject to Section 17625 of the Education Code.

The determination of the chargeable covered and enclosed space within the perimeter of a commercial or industrial structure shall be made by the building department of the city or county issuing the building permit, in accordance with the building standards of that city or county. For the determination of chargeable fees to be paid to the appropriate school district in connection with any commercial or industrial construction under the jurisdiction of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the architect of record shall determine the chargeable covered and enclosed space within the perimeter of a commercial or industrial structure.
(3) The amount of the limits set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be increased in 2000, and every two years thereafter, according to the adjustment for inflation set forth in the statewide cost index for class B construction, as determined by the State Allocation Board at its January meeting, which increase shall be effective as of the date of that meeting.
(c) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, during the term of a contract entered into between a subdivider or builder and a school district, city, county, or city and county, whether general law or chartered, on or before January 1, 1987, that requires the payment of a fee, charge, or dedication for the construction of school facilities as a condition to the approval of residential construction, neither Section 17620 of the Education Code nor this chapter applies to that residential construction.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of state or local law, construction that is subject to a contract entered into between a person and a school district, city, county, or city and county, whether general law or chartered, after January 1, 1987, and before the operative date of the act that adds paragraph (3) that requires the payment of a fee, charge, or dedication for the construction of school facilities as a condition to the approval of construction, may not be affected by the act that adds paragraph (3).
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of state or local law, until January 1, 2000, any construction not subject to a contract as described in paragraph (2) that is carried out on real property for which residential development was made subject to a condition relating to school facilities imposed by a state or local agency in connection with a legislative act approving or authorizing the residential development of that property after January 1, 1987, and before the operative date of the act adding this paragraph, shall be required to comply with that condition.
Notwithstanding any other provision of state or local law, on and after January 1, 2000, any construction not subject to a contract as described in paragraph (2) that is carried out on real property for which residential development was made subject to a condition relating to school facilities imposed by a state or local agency in connection with a legislative act approving or authorizing the residential development of that property after January 1, 1987, and before the operative date of the act adding this paragraph, may not be subject to a fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement exceeding the amount specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b), or, if a district has increased the limit specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) pursuant to either Section 65995.5 or 65995.7, that increased amount.
(4) Any construction that is not subject to a contract as described in paragraph (2), or to paragraph (3), and that satisfies both of the requirements of this paragraph, may not be subject to any increased fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement authorized by the act that adds this paragraph beyond the amount specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b).
(A) A tentative map, development permit, or conditional use permit was approved before the operative date of the act that amends this subdivision.
(B) A building permit is issued before January 1, 2000.
(d) For purposes of this chapter, “construction” means new construction and reconstruction of existing building for residential, commercial, or industrial. “Residential, commercial, or industrial construction” does not include any facility used exclusively for religious purposes that is thereby exempt from property taxation under the laws of this state, any facility used exclusively as a private full-time day school as described in Section 48222 of the Education Code, or any facility that is owned and occupied by one or more agencies of federal, state, or local government. In addition, “commercial or industrial construction” includes, but is not limited to, any hotel, inn, motel, tourist home, or other lodging for which the maximum term of occupancy for guests does not exceed 30 days, but does not include any residential hotel, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 50519 of the Health and Safety Code.
(e) The Legislature finds and declares that the financing of school facilities and the mitigation of the impacts of land use approvals, whether legislative or adjudicative, or both, on the need for school facilities are matters of statewide concern. For this reason, the Legislature hereby occupies the subject matter of requirements related to school facilities levied or imposed in connection with, or made a condition of, any land use approval, whether legislative or adjudicative act, or both, and the mitigation of the impacts of land use approvals, whether legislative or adjudicative, or both, on the need for school facilities, to the exclusion of all other measures, financial or nonfinancial, on the subjects. For purposes of this subdivision, “school facilities” means any school-related consideration relating to a school district’s ability to accommodate enrollment.
(f) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit or prohibit the use of Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5 to finance the construction or reconstruction of school facilities. However, the use of Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5 may not be required as a condition of approval of any legislative or adjudicative act, or both, if the purpose of the community facilities district is to finance school facilities.
(g) (1) The refusal of a person to agree to undertake or cause to be undertaken an act relating to Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 53311) of Division 2 of Title 5, including formation of, or annexation to, a community facilities district, voting to levy a special tax, or authorizing another to vote to levy a special tax, may not be a factor when considering the approval of a legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization, as defined in Section 56021 or 56073, if the purpose of the community facilities district is to finance school facilities.
(2) If a person voluntarily elects to establish, or annex into, a community facilities district and levy a special tax approved by landowner vote to finance school facilities, the present value of the special tax specified in the resolution of formation shall be calculated as an amount per square foot of assessable space and that amount shall be a credit against any applicable fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities. For purposes of this paragraph, the calculation of present value shall use the interest rate paid on the United States Treasury’s 30-year bond on the date of the formation of, or annexation to, the community facilities district, as the capitalization rate.
(3) For purposes of subdivisions (f), (h), and (i), and this subdivision, “school facilities” means any school-related consideration relating to a school district’s ability to accommodate enrollment.
(h) The payment or satisfaction of a fee, charge, or other requirement levied or imposed pursuant to Section 17620 of the Education Code in the amount specified in Section 65995 and, if applicable, any amounts specified in Section 65995.5 or 65995.7 are hereby deemed to be full and complete mitigation of the impacts of any legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization as defined in Section 56021 or 56073, on the provision of adequate school facilities.
(i) A state or local agency may not deny or refuse to approve a legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization as defined in Section 56021 or 56073 on the basis of a person’s refusal to provide school facilities mitigation that exceeds the amounts authorized pursuant to this section or pursuant to Section 65995.5 or 65995.7, as applicable.","Existing law, the Planning and Zoning Law, limits the amount of fees, charges, dedications, or other requirements levied or imposed by state and local agencies on the planning, use, or development of real property for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities based upon assessable space, as defined. In the case of residential construction, existing law defines assessable space to mean all of the square footage within the perimeter of a residential structure, not including any carport, walkway, garage, overhang, patio, enclosed patio, detached accessory structure, or similar area.
This bill would revise the definition of assessable space to specify that a covered or uncovered walkway is excluded.","An act to amend Section 65995 of the Government Code, relating to land use."

For any applicant that is so determined, the director shall include in the application file a written confirmation of eligibility and any award of funds. An application made pursuant to the director’s determination under this section may be evaluated solely on the basis of eligibility, need, benefit, or readiness, without regard to any specific rating criteria provided by Section 7078 of the California Code of Regulations.

Section 51335 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
51335.
(a) (1) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of units in a multifamily rental housing development financed, or for which financing has been extended or committed, pursuant to this chapter shall be for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households. If a multifamily rental housing development is located within a targeted area, as described by Section 143(j) of Title 26 of the United States Code, not less than 15 percent of the total number of units financed, or for which financing has been extended or committed pursuant to this chapter, shall be for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households. Not less than one-half of the units required for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households shall be for occupancy on a priority basis for very low income households. However, with approval of the board, the agency may waive the priority requirements for very low income households in designated geographic areas of the state upon a determination that the housing needs of a substantial number of lower income households will not otherwise be met.
The rental payments on the units required for occupancy by very low income households paid by the persons occupying the units (excluding any supplemental rental assistance from the state, the federal government, or any other public agency to those persons or on behalf of those units) shall not exceed 30 percent of 50 percent of area median income. If the sponsor elects to establish a base rent for all or part of the units for lower income households and very low income households, the base rents shall be adjusted for household size. In adjusting rents for household size, the agency shall either assume that one person will occupy a studio unit, two persons will occupy a one-bedroom unit, three persons will occupy a two-bedroom unit, four persons will occupy a three-bedroom unit, and five persons will occupy a four-bedroom unit, or commencing September 1, 2016, utilize occupancy assumptions that it determines to be appropriate and commercially reasonable for financing extended pursuant to this chapter.
(2) The local agency issuing permits for the development of the multifamily rental housing development shall consider opportunities to contribute to the economic feasibility of the units and to the provision of units for very low income households through concessions and inducements such as the following:
(A) Reductions in construction and design requirements.
(B) Reductions in setback and square footage requirements and the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required.
(C) Granting density bonuses.
(D) Providing expedited processing of permits.
(E) Modifying zoning code requirements to allow mixed use zoning.
(F) Reducing or eliminating fees and charges for filing and processing applications, petitions, permits, planning services, water and sewer connections, and other fees and charges.
(G) Reducing or eliminating requirements relating to monetary exactions, dedications, reservations of land, or construction of public facilities.
(H) Other financial incentives or concessions for the multifamily rental housing development which result in identifiable cost reductions, as determined by the agency. The agency shall ensure that the local agency issuing permits for the development considers its responsibilities under this section and makes a good faith effort to enhance the feasibility of the project and to provide housing for lower income households and very low income households.
(3) The agency shall not permit a selection criteria to be applied to certificate holders under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1437f) that is any more burdensome than the criteria applied to all other prospective tenants.
(4) It is the intent of the Legislature that the agency finance projects that assist in meeting the urgent need for providing shelter for lower income households, very low income households, and persons and families of low or moderate income. To that end, the quality of materials and the amenities provided should not be excessive so as to hinder the prospect of achieving the stated goal. The Legislature finds and declares that the design standards utilized by the agency in the past including, but not limited to, the design requirements adopted to govern the new construction program under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1437f), are substantially in excess of those required for a decent, healthy, and safe residential unit and intends, by the amendment adding this paragraph to this section by the Statutes of 1985, that the agency finance multifamily rental developments with substantially less costly design requirements than those required by the agency prior to January 1, 1986.
(5) It is the intent of the Legislature that the agency finance projects that assist in meeting the urgent need for providing shelter for families. To that end, developments with three- and four-bedroom units affordable to larger families shall have priority over competing developments.
(b) As a condition of financing pursuant to this chapter, the housing sponsor shall enter into a regulatory agreement with the agency providing that units reserved for occupancy by lower income households remain available on a priority basis for occupancy until the bonds are retired. The regulatory agreement shall contain a provision making the covenants and conditions of the agreement binding upon successors in interest of the housing sponsor and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, these burdens of the regulatory agreement shall run with the land. The regulatory agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the multifamily rental housing development is located. The regulatory agreement shall be recorded in the grantor-grantee index to the name of the property owner as grantor and to the name of the agency as grantee.
(c)  The agency shall ensure that units occupied by lower income households are of comparable quality and offer a range of sizes and number of bedrooms comparable to those units which are available to other tenants.
(d) (1) The agency shall give priority to processing construction loans and mortgage loans or may take other steps such as reducing loan fees for multifamily rental housing developments which incorporate innovative and energy-efficient techniques which reduce development or operating costs and which have the lowest feasible per unit cost, as determined by the agency, based on efficiency of design, the elimination of improvements that are not required by applicable building standards, or a reduction in the amount of local fees imposed on the development.
(2) The agency shall give equal priority to processing construction loans and mortgage loans or may take other steps such as reducing loan fees on multifamily rental housing developments which do any of the following:
(A) Utilize federal housing or development assistance.
(B) Utilize redevelopment funds or other local financial assistance, including, but not limited to, contributions of land, or for which local fees have been reduced.
(C) Are sponsored by a nonprofit housing organization.
(D) Provide a significant number of housing units, as determined by the agency, as part of a coordinated jobs and housing plan adopted by a local government.
(E) Exceed a ratio whereby 20 percent of the units are reserved for occupancy by lower income households, or whereby 10 percent of the units are reserved for occupancy by very low income households, or which provide units for lower income households or very low income households for the longest period of time beyond the minimum number of years.
(e) (1) New and existing rental housing developments may be syndicated after prior written approval of the agency. The agency shall grant that approval only after the agency determines that the terms and conditions of the syndication comply with this section.
(2) The terms and conditions of the syndication shall not reduce or limit any of the requirements of this chapter or regulations adopted or documents executed pursuant to this chapter. No requirements of the state shall be subordinated to the syndication agreement. A syndication shall not result in the provision of fewer assisted units, or the reduction of any benefits or services, than were in existence prior to the syndication agreement.

Section 51340 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
51340.
This chapter constitutes an alternative method to finance construction loans and mortgage loans for multifamily rental housing pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
SEC. 4.
Nothing in this act shall be interpreted to modify the terms of any regulatory agreement recorded on or before August 31, 2016, including, but not limited to, terms that incorporate Section 51335 of the Health and Safety Code by reference.
SEC. 5.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
The lack of availability of affordable housing is of vital statewide importance and must be addressed as quickly as possible, and therefore this act must take immediate effect.","(1) Existing law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to allocate funds under the federal Community Development Block Grant Program to cities and counties. Existing law requires the department to determine and announce, in the applicable Notice of Funding Availability, the maximum amount of grant funds that may be used for economic development projects and programs, housing for persons and families of low or moderate income or for purposes directly related to the provision or improvement of housing opportunities for these persons and families, and for cities and counties that apply on behalf of certain Indian tribes. Existing law requires the department to develop and use certain eligibility criteria and requirements for certain economic development fund applications.
This bill would authorize the Department of Housing and Community Development to issue a Notice of Funding Availability under which the director of the department could determine that an applicant previously awarded funds is eligible to apply for, and receive, additional funds pursuant to the Community Development Block Grant Program, without regard to whether the applicant has expended at least a certain percentage of funds previously awarded.
(2) Existing law authorizes the Housing Finance Agency to issue revenue bonds for the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, refinancing, or development of multifamily rental housing and for the provision of capital improvements in connection with, and determined necessary to, that multifamily rental housing. Existing law requires no less than 20%, or 15% for those multifamily rental housing developments located in a target area, as defined, of the total number of units in a multifamily rental housing development, financed or for which financing has been extended or committed from the proceeds of sale of each bond issuance of the agency, to be for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households. Existing law further requires that not less than
1/2
of the units required for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households be for occupancy on a priority basis for very low income households.
This bill would authorize the agency to waive the priority requirements for very low income households upon approval of the board and a specified determination.
Existing law prohibits rental payments on units required for occupancy by very low income households paid by persons occupying the units from exceeding 30% of 50% of the area median income, and sets forth occupancy assumptions for adjusting rents for household size, as specified.
This bill would, commencing September 1, 2016, authorize the agency to also utilize occupancy assumptions that it has determined are appropriate and commercially reasonable for financing extended pursuant to these provisions.
Existing law provides that the authorization to issue revenue bonds for these purposes constitutes an alternative method to issue bonds for making construction loans and mortgage loans for multifamily rental housing.
This bill would instead provide that the authorization to issue revenue bonds for these purposes constitutes an alternative method to finance construction loans and mortgage loans for multifamily rental housing.
(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 50833, 51335, and 51340 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

(1) Existing
law authorizes the establishment of the San Diego Unified Port District for the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation, development, and regulation of harbor works and improvements for the harbor of San Diego and for the promotion of commerce, navigation, fisheries, and recreation.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law establishes a system for the recordation of cattle brands and establishes various fees in connection with the recordation and the use of a brand, as specified.

Existing law requires these fees to be deposited in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.
This bill would increase the inspection fees and other various fees in connection with the recordation and use of cattle brands. By increasing the amount of fees deposited in a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
(2) Existing law requires cattle to be inspected before being moved or transported under certain circumstances, including whenever cattle are sold.

(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 20751, 20754, 20755, 20756, 20757, 20758, 21283, 21283.5, 21285, 21288, 21288.5, 21563, and 21563.5 of, and to add Section 21060.4 to, the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to livestock, and making an appropriation therefor."

Existing law authorizes the district to operate in any city or county where the need for the district to operate has been declared, except that the district has no power to levy an ad valorem property tax unless a city or county adopts a specified resolution. Existing law provides for a city or county to annex to the district through a written request to the district and approval by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments.
This bill would revise and recast these provisions. The bill would provide that the boundaries of the district, at any point in time, shall consist of specified areas, including a city or county that has acted to annex to the district, and a city incorporated on or after January 1, 2016, if the newly incorporated city consists of territory that was included in the district prior to incorporation. The bill would require an annexation to be subject to an agreement between the annexing city or county and the district board specifying the terms and conditions of annexation, and would delete the requirement for approval of annexation by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments.

60605.12.
(a) By January 1, 2017, the Superintendent shall recommend to the state board a schedule for the regular update of academic content standards in all subjects for which standards have been adopted by the state board. The schedule shall be aligned to the current eight-year cycle of curriculum framework updates and instructional materials adoptions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 60200. It is the intent of the Legislature that content standards are updated before the revising of curriculum frameworks, and that curriculum framework revisions occur before the adoption of instructional materials.
(b) (1) When the academic content standards in a given subject area come up for review according to the schedule adopted under subdivision (a), the state board shall make a determination as to whether those standards require an update. That determination shall be based upon the following considerations:
(A) The amount of time since the standards were adopted or last updated.
(B) Whether additional research conducted since the standards were adopted or last updated justifies updates to the standards.
(C) The potential impact on existing curriculum, instructional materials, and assessment systems based upon the standards.
(2) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the consideration of national standards adopted by other states in making this determination.
(c) If the state board determines that an update to the academic content standards in a given subject is warranted, it shall convene an academic content standards advisory committee to recommend updates to the content standards in that subject. An academic content standards advisory committee shall consist of 21 members, appointed as follows:

(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that all of the following occur:
(1) The academic content standards advisory committees include representation from teachers of different grade level spans, including elementary, middle, and high school grades.

(3)  An academic content standards advisory committee membership reflects the diversity of the various ethnic groups, types of school districts, and regions in California.
(g) Each academic content standards advisory committee shall review the content standards established in its particular subject matter and shall prepare updates to the standards as the committee deems necessary.

(1) The extent to which its proposed updates reflect current and confirmed research in the subject area under consideration.
(2) The impact that the proposed updates will have upon school districts and existing curricula and assessments.
(i) An academic content standards advisory committee shall conduct at least two, and no more than six, in-person meetings that are open to the public and include opportunities for public input. An academic content standards advisory committee may convene additional meetings by teleconference or the Internet subject to the requirements of Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(j) Upon completing this review, the terms of the members of an academic content standards advisory committee shall cease.
(k) Upon updating the standards, an academic content standards advisory committee shall forward them to the state board, which shall do either of the following within 120 days of the
receipt:
receipt of the updated standards:
(1) Adopt the proposed updates as proposed by the committee.
(2) Reject the proposed updates as proposed by the committee. If the state board rejects the standards it shall provide a specific written explanation to the Superintendent, the Governor, and the Legislature of the reasons why the proposed standards were rejected.

(g),
(k),
the department shall post on its Internet Web site the updates proposed by an academic content standards advisory committee for a minimum of 60 days. The department shall include a link by which members of the public may submit comments on the proposed updates.
(m) Members of an academic content standards advisory committee shall serve without compensation, except for actual and necessary travel expenses and substitute costs.
(n) The Superintendent shall develop, and the state board shall adopt, guidelines to implement this section.
(o) The convening of an academic content standards advisory committee is contingent upon the Legislature appropriating funds for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.","Existing law required the State Board of Education to adopt statewide academic content standards in the core curriculum areas of reading, writing, and mathematics, and requires the Academic Content Standards Commission to develop academic content standards in language arts and mathematics. Existing law also authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to recommend, and for the state board to approve, modifications to the common core academic content standards in mathematics, as specified.
This bill would require the Superintendent, by January 1, 2017, to recommend to the state board a schedule for the regular update of academic content standards in all subjects for which standards have been adopted by the state board in accordance with specified procedures, including the establishment of academic content standards advisory committees for those purposes and the recommendation of proposed updates by those committees to the state board.","An act to add Section 60605.12 to the Education Code, relating to academic content standards."

Section 66704.05 of the Government Code is amended to read:
66704.05.
(a) If the authority proposes a measure pursuant to subdivision (a) or (e) of Section 66704 that will generate revenues, the board of supervisors of the county or counties in which the measure is proposed shall call a special election on the measure. The special election shall be consolidated with the next regularly scheduled statewide election and the measure shall be submitted to the voters in the appropriate counties, consistent with the requirements of Articles XIII A, XIII C, and XIII D of the California Constitution, as applicable.
(b) (1) The authority is a district, as defined in Section 317 of the Elections Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a measure proposed by the authority that requires voter approval shall be submitted to the voters of the authority in accordance with the provisions of the Elections Code applicable to districts, including the provisions of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 9300) of Division 9 of the Elections Code.
(2) Because the authority has no revenues as of the effective date of this paragraph, the appropriations limit for the authority shall be originally established based on receipts from the initial measure that would generate revenues for the authority pursuant to subdivision (a), and that establishment of an appropriations limit shall not be deemed a change in an appropriations limit for purposes of Section 4 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
(c) The authority shall file with the board of supervisors of each county in which the measure shall appear on the ballot a resolution of the authority requesting consolidation, and setting forth the exact form of the ballot question, in accordance with Section 10403 of the Elections Code.
(d) The legal counsel for the authority shall prepare an impartial analysis of the measure. The impartial analysis prepared by the legal counsel for the authority shall be subject to review and revision by the county counsel of the county that contains the largest population, as determined by the most recent federal decennial census, among those counties in which the measure will be submitted to the voters.
(e) Each county included in the measure shall use the exact ballot question, impartial analysis, and ballot language provided by the authority. If two or more counties included in the measure are required to prepare a translation of ballot materials into the same language other than English, the county that contains the largest population, as determined by the most recent federal decennial census, among those counties that are required to prepare a translation of ballot materials into the same language other than English shall prepare the translation and that translation shall be used by the other county or counties, as applicable.
(f) Notwithstanding Section 13116 of the Elections Code, if a measure proposed by the authority pursuant to this article is submitted to the voters of the authority in two or more counties, the elections officials of those counties shall mutually agree to use the same letter designation for the measure.
(g) The county clerk of each county shall report the results of the special election to the authority.
(h) (1) Notwithstanding Section 10520 of the Elections Code, for the first election at which the authority proposes a measure pursuant to subdivision (a) or (e) of Section 66704 that would generate revenues, the authority shall reimburse each county in which that measure appears on the ballot only for the incremental costs incurred by the county elections official related to submitting the measure to the voters.
(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “incremental costs” include all of the following:
(A) The cost to prepare, review, and revise the impartial analysis of the measure that is required by subdivision (d).
(B) The cost to prepare a translation of ballot materials into a language other than English by any county, as described in subdivision (e).
(C) The additional costs that exceed the costs incurred for other election races or ballot measures, if any, appearing on the same ballot in each county in which the measure appears on the ballot, including both of the following:
(i) The printing and mailing of ballot materials.
(ii) The canvass of the vote regarding the measure pursuant to Division 15 of the Elections Code.
(3) This subdivision is repealed on January 1, 2019.

Section 66706 of the Government Code is amended to read:
66706.
This title shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2049, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2049, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 5.
The Legislature finds and declares that the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority has not assumed any existing duties from another local or state government entity and has received no state or local government revenues not counted toward another entity’s appropriations limit. Therefore, the authority has no associated appropriations limit pursuant to Article XIII B of the California Constitution as of the date of enactment of this bill.
SEC. 6.
The Legislature finds and declares that the changes made by this act to subdivision (e) of Section 66704 of the Government Code explicitly affirm the authority of the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority to incur general obligation bonded indebtedness, so as to implement the Legislature’s intent when the statute first became operative on January 1, 2009.
SEC. 7.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority Act, until January 1, 2029, establishes the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority to raise and allocate resources for the restoration, enhancement, protection, and enjoyment of wetlands and wildlife habitat in the San Francisco Bay and along its shoreline. The act establishes a governing board of the authority composed of specified members, including a member who is a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program, who serves as the chair. The act grants to the board all powers that are necessary to carry out the act, including, among other things, the power to levy specified benefit assessments, special taxes, and property-related fees, and to issue revenue bonds and general obligation bonds. However, the act limits the total amount of outstanding indebtedness incurred pursuant to those provisions authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds to 10% of the authority’s total revenues in the preceding fiscal year. Existing law generally requires a district to reimburse the county elections official for the actual costs incurred in conducting an election for the district. However, the act authorizes, until January 1, 2017, the authority to reimburse only the incremental costs, as defined, that are incurred by the county elections official related to submitting a special tax measure to the voters.
This bill would delete the requirement that one member of the board, who serves as the chair, be a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program and would instead require that member to be an elected official of a bayside city or county, or an elected member of a special district, with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program. The bill would also delete the limit on the authority’s total amount of outstanding general obligation bonded indebtedness and would, instead, prohibit the authority from having a total amount of outstanding bonded indebtedness that exceeds $1,500,000,000. The bill would specify that the authority may incur general obligation bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property or for the funding or refunding of any outstanding bonded indebtness incurred by the authority. The bill would extend to January 1, 2019, the operation of the provision authorizing the authority to reimburse county elections officials for only the incremental costs of submitting a special tax measure to the voters, expanded to apply to other specified measures that would generate revenues for the authority. The bill would postpone to January 1, 2049, the repeal date for the act, and would make related conforming changes. By imposing additional duties on local government officials with regard to implementation of the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The act specifies that the special taxes are to be levied, and submitted to the voters, consistent with specified provisions of the California Constitution relating to voter approval for local tax levies and property-related fees, charges, and assessments.
This bill would instead specify that measures that will generate revenues are to be submitted to the voters, consistent with those requirements of the California Constitution and the requirements of the California Constitution relating to general obligation bond indebtedness and ad valorem taxes.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 66703, 66704, 66704.05, and 66706 of the Government Code, relating to the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority."

(b) If the property received an exemption on the current roll or the roll being prepared and the assessee on the supplemental roll is eligible for an exemption and, in those instances in which the provisions of this division require the filing of a claim for the exemption, the assessee makes a claim for an exemption of a greater amount, then the difference in the amount between the two exemptions shall be applied to the supplemental assessment.
(c) In those instances in which the provisions of this division require the filing of a claim for the exemption, except as provided in subdivision (d), (e), or (f), any person claiming to be eligible for an exemption to be applied against the amount of the supplemental assessment shall file a claim or an amendment to a current claim, in that form as prescribed by the board, on or before the 30th day following the date of notice of the supplemental assessment, in order to receive a 100-percent exemption.
(1) With respect to property as to which the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization,

(A) Ninety percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon, or any amount of tax or penalty or interest thereon exceeding two hundred fifty dollars ($250) in total amount, whichever is greater, for each supplemental assessment, provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the date on which the first installment of taxes on the supplemental tax bill becomes delinquent, as provided by Section 75.52.

(4) With respect to property as to which the disabled veterans’ exemption was available, but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, that portion of tax attributable to 90 percent of the amount of exemption available shall be canceled or refunded, provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the date on which the first installment of taxes on the supplemental tax bill becomes delinquent, as provided by Section 75.52. If an appropriate application for exemption is thereafter filed, 85 percent of the amount of the exemption available shall be canceled or refunded.
(5) With respect to property as to which any other exemption was available, but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, the following amounts shall be canceled or refunded:
(A) Ninety percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon, provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the date on which the first installment of taxes on the supplemental tax bill becomes delinquent, as provided by Section 75.52.

Other provisions of this division pertaining to the late filing of claims for exemption do not apply to assessments made pursuant to this chapter.
(d) For purposes of this section, any claim for the homeowners’ exemption, veterans’ exemption, or disabled veterans’ exemption previously filed by the owner of a dwelling, granted and in effect, constitutes the claim or claims for that exemption required in this section. In the event that a claim for the homeowners’ exemption, veterans’ exemption, or disabled veterans’ exemption is not in effect, a claim for any of those exemptions for a single supplemental assessment for a change in ownership or new construction occurring on or after June 1, up to and including December 31, shall apply to that assessment; a claim for any of those exemptions for the two supplemental assessments for a change in ownership or new construction occurring on or after January 1, up to and including May 31, one for the current fiscal year and one for the following fiscal year, shall apply to those assessments. In either case, if granted, the claim shall remain in effect until title to the property changes, the owner does not occupy the home as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date, or the property is otherwise ineligible pursuant to Section 205, 205.5, or 218.
(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), an additional exemption claim may not be required to be filed until the next succeeding lien date in the case in which a supplemental assessment results from the completion of new construction on property that has previously been granted exemption on either the current roll or the roll being prepared.
(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), an additional exemption claim is not required to be filed in the instance where a supplemental assessment results from a change in ownership of property where the purchaser of the property owns and uses or uses, as the case may be, other property that has been granted the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization,
public school,
free public libraries, free museums, or welfare exemption on either the current roll or the roll being prepared and the property purchased is put to the same use.

(2) Property owned by any organization that would have qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption had the organization been in existence on the lien date, that was acquired by it during that calendar year after the lien date in that year but before the commencement of that fiscal year, and of a kind that presently qualifies for the exemption and that would have so qualified for that fiscal year had it been owned by the organization on the lien date and had the organization been in existence on the lien date, shall be canceled or refunded.
(3) Property acquired after the beginning of any fiscal year by an organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption and the property is of a kind that would have qualified for an exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, whether or not that organization was in existence on the lien date, shall be canceled or refunded in the proportion that the number of days for which the property was so qualified during the fiscal year bears to 365.
(b) Eighty-five percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon imposed upon property that would be entitled to relief under subdivision (a) or Section 214.01, except that an appropriate application for exemption was not filed within the time required by the applicable provision, shall be canceled or refunded provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed after the last day on which relief could be granted under subdivision (a) or Section 214.01.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, with respect to supplemental property tax assessments, specifies various limitation periods for assessments on the supplemental tax roll. Existing law provides for the application of property tax exemptions to those supplemental assessments provided, among other things, that an assessee file an exemption application within a specified time. Existing property tax law allows taxes, penalties, and interest imposed for late filings of property tax exemption applications for the supplemental roll that exceed $250 in total to be canceled or refunded up to 85% or 90%, as applicable, in the case of the exemption for a college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, or veterans’ organization.

Existing property tax law provides, with respect to property as to which the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, free public libraries, free museums, public schools, community colleges, state colleges, state universities, tribal housing, or welfare exemption was available but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, that 90% of any tax or penalty or interest on that property shall be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the lien date in the calendar year next succeeding the calendar year in which the exemption was not claimed by a timely application.
Existing property tax law requires, if an appropriate application for exemption is filed within 90 days from the first day of the month following the month in which the property was acquired or by February 15 of the following calendar year, whichever occurs first, any tax or penalty or interest imposed upon property owned by any organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption that is acquired by that organization during a given calendar year, after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year, if the property is of a kind that would have been qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, to be canceled or refunded.
This bill would add public schools to the list of entities eligible for the cancellation or refund of any tax or penalty or interest imposed on property acquired in a given calendar year after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year. The bill also would make conforming changes.
By increasing the duties of local officials relative to the administration of taxes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

615,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Teachers in state-funded educational child development programs are denied living wages.
(2) Low wages for the predominantly female staff of these programs contributes significantly to the gender pay gap in California.
(3) Many nonprofit, community-based child development agencies are unable to provide employer-paid health insurance to their employees and their families.
(4) There is a steady stream of both school district and nonprofit agencies closing their child development programs.
(5) The cause of these problems is an inadequate standard reimbursement rate for state-funded child development centers, due to a 34-year history of either no annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) or substandard raises. The lack of adequate COLAs has cut the buying power, wages, and benefits in these agencies by 22 percent since 1980, and has bankrupted programs.
(b) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature to both consistently provide these state-funded child development programs with annual cost-of-living adjustments equal to the inflation adjustments given to K–12 education programs, and to take additional steps to rebuild wages, benefits, and financial stability in these programs.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate gender pay inequity in wages for the predominantly female and college educated staff of these programs.
(3) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure and enhance the ability of these programs for young children to meet the high educational standards required by state and federal law and regulations, and to retain skilled and trained teachers by increasing the standard reimbursement rate.
SECTION 1.

Section 8265 of the Education Code is amended to read:
8265.
(a) The Superintendent shall implement a plan that establishes reasonable standards and assigned reimbursement rates, which vary with the length of the program year and the hours of service.
(1) Parent fees shall be used to pay reasonable and necessary costs for providing additional services.
(2) When establishing standards and assigned reimbursement rates, the Superintendent shall confer with applicant agencies.
(3) The reimbursement system, including standards and rates, shall be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
(4) The Superintendent may establish any regulations he or she deems advisable concerning conditions of service and hours of enrollment for children in the programs.
(b)
(1)
The standard reimbursement rate shall be nine thousand twenty-four dollars and seventy-five cents ($9,024.75) per unit of average daily enrollment for a 250-day year, and commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year, shall be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment granted by the Legislature annually pursuant to Section 42238.15.
The standard reimbursement rate is not intended to fund mandated costs imposed upon child development programs due to actions of law relating to minimum wage requirements, health insurance requirements, new or increased fees, new or expanded program requirements, or other cost increases due to legislative action.
(2) In addition to the increase in paragraph (1), the standard reimbursement rate shall be raised as needed to provide a living wage, reasonable health insurance, and retirement benefits for employees, to support the recruitment and retention of skilled and trained teachers, to support the financial stability of programs and educational quality, and to achieve gender pay equity.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “cost-of-living adjustment” means an annual increase in funding and the standard reimbursement rate to maintain buying power as the result of inflation. Notwithstanding any other law, for each fiscal year, the amount of cost-of-living adjustment provided by Section 42238.15 shall at least be equal to the amount of the inflation adjustment provided by Section 42238.1.
(c) The plan shall require agencies having an assigned reimbursement rate above the current year standard reimbursement rate to reduce costs on an incremental basis to achieve the standard reimbursement rate.
(d) The plan shall provide for adjusting reimbursement on a case-by-case basis, in order to maintain service levels for agencies currently at a rate less than the standard reimbursement rate. Assigned reimbursement rates shall be increased only on the basis of one or more of the following:
(1) Loss of program resources from other sources.
(2) Need of an agency to pay the same child care rates as those prevailing in the local community.
(3) Increased costs directly attributable to new or different regulations.
(4) (A) Documented increased costs necessary to maintain the prior year’s level of service and ensure the continuation of threatened programs.
(B) Child care agencies funded at the lowest rates shall be given first priority for increases.
(e) The plan shall provide for expansion of child development programs at no more than the standard reimbursement rate for that fiscal year.
(f) The Superintendent may reduce the percentage of reduction for a public agency that satisfies any of the following:
(1) Serves more than 400 children.
(2) Has in effect a collective bargaining agreement.
(3) Has other extenuating circumstances that apply, as determined by the Superintendent.","Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to implement a plan that establishes reasonable child care standards and assigned reimbursement rates, as provided. Existing law requires the standard reimbursement rate to be increased annually by a cost-of-living adjustment, as provided.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
This bill would provide that the standard reimbursement rate is not intended to fund mandated costs imposed upon child development programs due to actions of law relating to minimum wage requirements, health insurance requirements, new or increased fees, new or expanded program requirements, or other cost increases due to legislative action. The bill would also require the standard reimbursement rate to be raised as needed to provide a living wage, reasonable health insurance, and retirement benefits for employees, to support the recruitment and retention of skilled and trained teachers, to support the financial stability of programs and educational quality, and to achieve gender pay equity.

The department shall establish a grant program within the Public School Health Center Support Program to provide technical assistance, and funding for the expansion, renovation, and retrofitting of existing school health centers, and the development of new school health centers, in accordance with the following procedures and requirements:
(a) A school health center receiving grant funds pursuant to this section shall meet or have a plan to meet the following requirements:
(1) Strive to provide a comprehensive set of services including medical, oral health, mental health, health education, and related services in response to community needs.
(2) Provide primary and other health care services, provided or supervised by a licensed professional, which may include all of the following:

(C) Management of chronic medical conditions.
(D) Basic laboratory tests.
(E) Referrals to and followup for specialty care.
(F) Reproductive health services.
(G) Nutrition services.
(H) Mental health services provided or supervised by an appropriately licensed mental health professional may include: assessments, crisis intervention, counseling, treatment, and referral to a continuum of services including emergency psychiatric care, community support programs, inpatient care, and outpatient programs.

(I) Oral health services that may include preventive services, basic restorative services, and referral to specialty services.
(3) Work in partnership with the school nurse, if one is employed by the school or school district, to provide individual and family health education; school or districtwide health promotion; first aid and administration of medications; facilitation of student enrollment in health insurance programs; screening of students to identify the need for physical, mental health, and oral health services; referral and linkage to services not offered onsite; public health and disease surveillance; and emergency response procedures. A school health center may receive grant funding pursuant to this section if the school or school district does not employ a school nurse. However, it is not the intent of the Legislature that a school health center serve as a substitute for a school nurse employed by a local school or school district.
(4) Have a written contract or memorandum of understanding between the school district and the health care provider or any other community providers that ensures coordination of services, ensures confidentiality and privacy of health information consistent with applicable federal and state laws, and integration of services into the school environment.

Existing law, for purposes of those provisions, defines a “school health center” to mean a center or program located at or near a local educational agency that provides age-appropriate health care services at the program site or through referrals, and may conduct routine physical health, mental health, and oral health assessments. Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health, to the extent funds are appropriated to the department, to establish a grant program to provide technical assistance, and funding for the expansion, renovation, and retrofitting of existing school health centers, and the development of new school health centers, in accordance with specified procedures. Existing law requires the department to develop a request for proposal (RFP) process for collecting information on applicants, and determining which proposals shall receive grant funding, giving preference for grant funding to schools in areas designated as federally medically underserved areas or in areas with medically underserved populations, or schools with a high percentage of low-income and uninsured children and youth.

It is unlawful for a person to purchase more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law requires a person or entity that sells any quantity of specified substances to record the date of sale, product description, purchaser’s identification, and other specified information. Existing law requires the seller to retain this information for a period of 5 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. Existing law requires a person or entity that purchases any quantity of these specified substances to record the date of purchase, product description, and other specified information for a period of 3 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill would add butane to the list of specified substances for which these requirements apply. The bill would also prohibit any person from purchasing more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month. Because the bill would create a new crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Subject to the requirements of Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 47000) of Division 17 of the Food and Agricultural Code, and to the discretion and managerial control of a certified farmers’ market or community event operator, respectively, a certified farmers’ market beer sales permit shall authorize the licensee, a member of the licensee’s family who is 21 years of age or older, or an employee of the licensee to sell packaged beer that has been manufactured by a beer manufacturer applying for the permit at a certified farmers’ market, including any permitted community event area adjacent to, and operated in conjunction with, a certified farmers’ market, located within the county or an adjacent county of the physical location of the licensed beer manufacturer.
(2) (A) A certified farmers’ market beer sales permit shall also authorize an instructional tasting event on the subject of beer at a certified farmers’ market, including any permitted community event area adjacent to, and operated in conjunction with, a certified farmers’ market, located within the county or an adjacent county of the physical location of the licensed beer manufacturer.

This bill would additionally authorize those nonprofit corporations to receive and possess beer under the same circumstances.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to issue a special temporary on-sale or off-sale wine license to a nonprofit corporation that is exempt from payment of income taxes, subject to specified requirements and limitations.

619,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that:
(a) All California women, regardless of income, should have access to reproductive health services. The state provides insurance coverage of reproductive health care and counseling to eligible, low-income women. Some of these programs have been recently established or expanded as a result of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
(b) Millions of California women are in need of publicly funded family planning services, contraception services and education, abortion services, and prenatal care and delivery. In 2012, more than 2.6 million California women were in need of publicly funded family planning services. More than 700,000 California women become pregnant every year and one-half of these pregnancies are unintended. In 2010, 64.3 percent of unplanned births in California were publicly funded. Yet, at the moment they learn that they are pregnant, thousands of women remain unaware of the public programs available to provide them with contraception, health education and counseling, family planning, prenatal care, abortion, or delivery.
(c) Because pregnancy decisions are time sensitive, and care early in pregnancy is important, California must supplement its own efforts to advise women of its reproductive health programs. In California, low-income women can receive immediate access to free or low-cost comprehensive family planning services and pregnancy-related care through the Medi-Cal and the Family PACT programs. However, only Medi-Cal providers who are enrolled in the Family PACT program are authorized to enroll patients immediately at their health centers.
(d) The most effective way to ensure that women quickly obtain the information and services they need to make and implement timely reproductive decisions is to require licensed health care facilities that are unable to immediately enroll patients into the Family PACT or Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women Medi-Cal programs to advise each patient at the time of her visit of the various publicly funded family planning and pregnancy-related resources available in California, and the manner in which to directly and efficiently access those resources.
(e) It is also vital that pregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals. Unlicensed facilities that advertise and provide pregnancy testing and care must advise clients, at the time they are seeking or obtaining care, that these facilities are not licensed to provide medical care.
SEC. 2.
The purpose of this act is to ensure that California residents make their personal reproductive health care decisions knowing their rights and the health care services available to them.

(1) The facility offers obstetric ultrasounds, obstetric sonograms, or prenatal care to pregnant women.
(2) The facility offers pregnancy testing or pregnancy diagnosis.
(3) The facility advertises or solicits patrons with offers to provide prenatal sonography, pregnancy tests, or pregnancy options counseling.
(4) The facility has staff or volunteers who collect health information from clients.
(c) This article shall not apply to either of the following:
(1) A clinic directly conducted, maintained, or operated by the United States or any of its departments, officers, or agencies.
(2) A licensed primary care clinic that is enrolled as a Medi-Cal provider and a provider in the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program.
123472.
(a) A licensed covered facility shall disseminate to clients on site the following notice in English and in the primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries as determined by the State Department of Health Care Services for the county in which the facility is located.
(1) The notice shall state:


“California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women. To determine whether you qualify, contact the county social services office at [insert the telephone number].”


(2) The information shall be disclosed in one of the following ways:

(B) A printed notice distributed to all clients in no less than 14-point type.
(C) A digital notice distributed to all clients that can be read at the time of check-in or arrival, in the same point type as other digital disclosures. A printed notice as described in subparagraph (B) shall be available for all clients who cannot or do not wish to receive the information in a digital format.
(3) The notice may be combined with other mandated disclosures.
(b) An unlicensed covered facility shall disseminate to clients on site and in any print and digital advertising materials including Internet Web sites, the following notice in English and in the primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries as determined by the State Department of Health Care Services for the county in which the facility is located.
(1) The notice shall state: “This facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.”
(2) The onsite notice shall be a sign at least 8.5 inches by 11 inches and written in no less than 48-point type, and shall be posted conspicuously in the entrance of the facility and at least one additional area where clients wait to receive services.
(3) The notice in the advertising material shall be clear and conspicuous. “Clear and conspicuous” means in larger point type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from the surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.
123473.
(a) Covered facilities that fail to comply with the requirements of this article are liable for a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) for a first offense and one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each subsequent offense. The Attorney General, city attorney, or county counsel may bring an action to impose a civil penalty pursuant to this section after doing both of the following:
(1) Providing the covered facility with reasonable notice of noncompliance, which informs the facility that it is subject to a civil penalty if it does not correct the violation within 30 days from the date the notice is sent to the facility.
(2) Verifying that the violation was not corrected within the 30-day period described in paragraph (1).
(b) The civil penalty shall be deposited into the General Fund if the action is brought by the Attorney General. If the action is brought by a city attorney, the civil penalty shall be paid to the treasurer of the city in which the judgment is entered. If the action is brought by a county counsel, the civil penalty shall be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the judgment is entered.
SEC. 4.
The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.","Existing law, the Reproductive Privacy Act, provides that every individual possesses a fundamental right of privacy with respect to reproductive decisions. Existing law provides that the state shall not deny or interfere with a woman’s right to choose or obtain an abortion prior to viability of the fetus, as defined, or when necessary to protect her life or health. Existing law specifies the circumstances under which the performance of an abortion is deemed unauthorized.
This bill would enact the Reproductive FACT (Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency) Act, which would require a licensed covered facility, as defined, to disseminate a notice to all clients, as specified, stating, among other things, that California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion, for eligible women. The bill would also require an unlicensed covered facility, as defined, to disseminate a notice to all clients, as specified, stating, among other things, that the facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California.
The bill would authorize the Attorney General, city attorney, or county counsel to bring an action to impose a specified civil penalty against covered facilities that fail to comply with these requirements.","An act to add Article 2.7 (commencing with Section 123470) to Chapter 2 of Part 2 of Division 106 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act regulates the application for, the issuance of, the suspension of, and the conditions imposed upon, various alcoholic beverage licenses pursuant to which the licensees may exercise specified privileges in the state.
This bill would authorize licensees to sponsor or otherwise participate in an event conducted by, and for the benefit of, a nonprofit organization subject to specified conditions, including that a nonretail or retail licensee may choose to participate in any level of sponsorship.
(2) The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed winegrower to apply to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for a wine sales event permit that allows the sale of bottled wine produced by that winegrower at specified events approved by the department. The act prohibits a wine sales event permit from being used more than 2 times a month at a particular location, and requires the winegrower to pay a fee of $50 for the permit. The act provides that moneys collected as fees pursuant to the act are to be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. These moneys are generally allocated to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control upon appropriation by the Legislature.
This bill would authorize a licensed beer manufacturer to apply to the department for a brewery event permit that allows the sale of beer produced by that beer manufacturer for consumption on property contiguous and adjacent to the licensed premises of the manufacturer, as provided. The bill would authorize a fee for a brewery event permit of $110 for the 2016 calendar year, and thereafter as provided, and an event authorization fee of not more than $25 for each approved event. The bill would allow up to 4 authorized events each calendar year.
(3) Existing law, known as tied-house restrictions, generally prohibits a manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, rectifier, California winegrower’s agent, distiller, bottler, importer, and wholesaler, and any officer, director, or agent of any of those persons, from having specified relationships with an on-sale alcoholic beverage licensee, with limited exceptions. Existing law specifies that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act does not prohibit holders of retail on-sale or off-sale licenses from purchasing advertising in any publication by specified alcoholic beverage licensees.
This bill would specify that the act does not prohibit purchasing advertising in a publication published by a nonretail licensee, as defined, and would include Internet Web sites and social media feeds as types of publications for these purposes.
(4) The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes specified licensees to purchase alcoholic beverages for resale under specified circumstances. The act provides that a person convicted of a violation of its provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor unless another penalty or punishment is specifically provided.
This bill would prohibit a retail licensee from purchasing beer from any beer manufacturer for the purpose of selling or offering to sell that beer under specified circumstances, including where the beer container contains the statement or is marked “Not Packaged for Resale”.
By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) Existing law requires the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, in any hearing on an accusation charging a licensee with a violation of specified provisions relating to minors, to produce the alleged minor for examination at the hearing unless he or she is unavailable as a witness because he or she is dead or unable to attend the hearing because of a then-existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, or unless the licensee has waived, in writing, the appearance of the minor. Existing law provides that when a minor is absent because of a then-existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, a reasonable continuance shall be granted to allow for the appearance of the minor if the administrative law judge finds that it is reasonably likely that the minor can be produced within a reasonable amount of time.
This bill would state that the above provisions are not intended to preclude the continuance of a hearing because of the unavailability of a minor for any other reason pursuant to a specified provision.","An act to amend Sections 25500 and 25666 of, and to add Sections 23355.3, 23399.65, and 23402.5 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to alcoholic beverages."

It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective, (2) each bill amends Section 4735 of the Civil Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 349, in which case Section 2 of this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
California is in a state of emergency because of the continued drought. In response, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-29-15, ordering a 25 percent statewide reduction in urban water consumption. Because residential landscaping accounts for 35 percent or more of the average urban water usage statewide, many homeowners have voluntarily ceased watering landscaping in order to assist with the drought emergency. However, some homeowners associations have interpreted existing law to allow them to fine homeowners who voluntarily cease using potable water on their landscaping if the homeowners association itself is using a de minimis amount of recycled water on common areas. This is directly contrary to the state’s need to conserve the precious and dwindling water supplied for urban, agricultural, and environmental needs.","The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act governs the management and operation of common interest developments. Existing law provides that, unless otherwise provided in the common interest development declaration, the association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the common area, other than exclusive use common area, and the owner of each separate interest is responsible for maintaining that separate interest and any exclusive use common area appurtenant to that interest. Existing law makes void and unenforceable any provision of the governing documents or architectural or landscaping guidelines or policies that prohibits use of low water-using plants, or prohibits or restricts compliance with water-efficient landscape ordinances or regulations on the use of water, as specified.
Existing law also prohibits an association, except an association that uses recycled water for landscape irrigation, from imposing a fine or assessment on separate interest owners for reducing or eliminating watering of vegetation or lawns during any period for which the Governor has declared a state of emergency or the local government has declared a local emergency due to drought.
This bill would revise that exception to instead authorize the imposition of a fine or assessment against the owner of a separate interest that receives recycled water from a retail water supplier, as defined, and fails to use that recycled water for landscaping irrigation.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 4735 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 349 that would become operative if this bill and AB 349 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 4735 of the Civil Code, relating to common interest developments, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

The pharmacist does not need to reduce to writing the address, telephone number, license classification, federal registry number of the prescriber or the address of the patient or patients if the information is readily retrievable in the pharmacy.
(b)A pharmacy receiving an electronic transmission prescription shall not be required to reduce that prescription to writing or to hard copy form if, for three years from the last date of furnishing pursuant to that prescription or order, the pharmacy is able, upon request by the board, to immediately produce a hard copy report that includes for each date of dispensing of a dangerous drug or dangerous device pursuant to that prescription or order: (1) all of the information described in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 4040, and (2) the name or identifier of the pharmacist who dispensed the dangerous drug or dangerous device. This subdivision shall not apply to prescriptions for controlled substances classified in Schedule II, III, IV, or V, except as permitted pursuant to Section 11164.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
(c)If only recorded and stored electronically, on magnetic media, or in any other computerized form, the pharmacy’s computer system shall not permit the received information or the dangerous drug or dangerous device dispensing information required by this section to be changed, obliterated, destroyed, or disposed of, for the record maintenance period required by law once the information has been received by the pharmacy and once the dangerous drug or dangerous device has been dispensed. Once a dangerous drug or dangerous device has been dispensed, if the previously created record is determined to be incorrect, a correcting addition may be made only by or with the approval of a pharmacist. After a pharmacist enters the change or enters his or her approval of the change into the computer, the resulting record shall include the correcting addition and the date it was made to the record, the identity of the person or pharmacist making the correction, and the identity of the pharmacist approving the correction.
(d)Nothing in this section shall impair the requirement to have an electronically transmitted prescription transmitted only to the pharmacy of the patient’s choice or to have a written prescription. This requirement shall not apply to orders for medications to be administered in an acute care hospital.","Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, establishes the California State Board of Pharmacy and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of pharmacists. Existing law makes a knowing violation of these provisions a crime.
Existing law requires every prescription, as defined, to include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, if requested by the patient. Existing law prohibits a pharmacist from dispensing any prescription unless it is in a specified container that is correctly labeled to include, among other information, the condition or purpose for which the drug was prescribed, if the condition or purpose is indicated on the prescription.
This bill would instead require that every prescription include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, and would authorize the prescriber or patient to request that this information not be included in the prescription container label. This bill would, similarly, require that every prescription container be correctly labeled to include that information, unless omission of that information has been requested by the prescriber or patient.
By establishing these additional requirements, the knowing violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, requires an oral or an electronic data transmission prescription to be reduced to writing by the pharmacist and to be filled by, or under the direction of, the pharmacist. Under existing law, the pharmacist does not need to reduce to writing the address, telephone number, license classification, federal registry number of the prescriber or the address of the patient or patients if the information is readily retrievable in the pharmacy.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, requires the State Department of Developmental Services to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law defines developmental disability for these purposes, to include, among other things, autism.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. A violation of those provisions is a crime. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance.
Existing law requires every health care service plan contract and health insurance policy to provide coverage for behavioral health treatment for pervasive developmental disorder or autism until January 1, 2017, and defines “behavioral health treatment” to mean specified services provided by, among others, a qualified autism service professional supervised and employed by a qualified autism service provider. For purposes of this provision, existing law defines a “qualified autism service professional” to mean a person who, among other requirements, is a behavioral service provider approved as a vendor by a California regional center to provide services as an associate behavior analyst, behavior analyst, behavior management assistant, behavior management consultant, or behavior management program pursuant to specified regulations adopted under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act.
This bill would delete the sunset date, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely. By extending the operation of these provisions, the violation of which by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1374.73 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10144.51 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage."

(b) (1) This section does not prevent a person from taking reasonable steps that are necessary to remove an animal from a motor vehicle if the person holds a reasonable belief that the animal’s safety is in immediate danger from heat, cold, lack of adequate ventilation, lack of food or water, or other circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause suffering, disability, or death to the animal.
(2) A person who removes an animal from a vehicle in accordance with paragraph (1) is not criminally liable for actions taken reasonably and in good faith if the person does all of the following:
(A) Determines the vehicle is locked or there is otherwise no reasonable manner for the animal to be removed from the vehicle.
(B) Has a good faith belief that forcible entry into the vehicle is necessary because the animal is in imminent danger of suffering harm if it is not immediately removed from the vehicle, and, based upon the circumstances known to the person at the time, the belief is a reasonable one.
(C) Has contacted a local law enforcement agency, the fire department, animal control, or the “911” emergency service prior to forcibly entering the vehicle.
(D) Remains with the animal in a safe location, out of the elements but reasonably close to the vehicle, until a peace officer, humane officer, animal control officer, or another emergency responder arrives.
(E) Used no more force to enter the vehicle and remove the animal from the vehicle than was necessary under the circumstances.

(3) A peace officer, firefighter, humane officer, animal control officer, or other emergency responder is authorized to take all steps that are reasonably necessary for the removal of an animal from a motor vehicle, including, but not limited to, breaking into the motor vehicle, after a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person responsible.
(4) A peace officer, firefighter, humane officer, animal control officer, or other emergency responder who removes an animal from a motor vehicle or who receives an animal rescued from a vehicle from another person shall, in a secure and conspicuous location on or within the motor vehicle, leave written notice bearing his or her name and office, and the address of the location where the animal can be claimed. The animal may be claimed by the owner only after payment of all charges that have accrued for the maintenance, care, medical treatment, or impoundment of the animal.
(5) Except as provided in subdivision (b), this section does not affect in any way existing liabilities or immunities in current law, or create any new immunities or liabilities.
(e) Nothing in this section shall preclude prosecution under both this section and Section 597 or any other provision of law, including city or county ordinances.
(f) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the transportation of horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, or other agricultural animals in motor vehicles designed to transport such animals for agricultural purposes.","Existing law authorizes a peace officer, humane officer, or animal control officer to take all steps reasonably necessary to remove an animal from a motor vehicle because the animal’s safety appears to be in immediate danger of specified harm. Existing law requires those persons who remove an animal from a vehicle to take the animal to an animal shelter or other place of safekeeping or, if deemed necessary, to a veterinary hospital for treatment, and to leave a notice in the vehicle that notifies the owner of, among other things, the location where the animal may be claimed. Existing law authorizes the owner to claim the animal only after paying all charges that have accrued for the maintenance, care, medical treatment, or impoundment of the animal.
This bill would expand the authorization and requirements applicable to a peace officer, humane officer, or animal control officer described above to include a firefighter or other emergency responder. The bill would additionally provide that a person may be required to pay for charges that have accrued for the maintenance, care, medical treatment, or impoundment of the animal removed from the vehicle. The bill would exempt a person from criminal liability for actions taken reasonably and in good faith to remove an animal from a vehicle under the circumstances described above if the person satisfies specified conditions, including immediately turning the animal over to a representative from law enforcement, animal control, or other emergency responder who responds to the scene. The bill would exempt a person from civil liability for property damage or trespass to a motor vehicle if the property damage or trespass occurred while the person was rescuing an animal pursuant to these provisions.","An act to add Section 43.100 to the Civil Code, and to amend Section 597.7 of the Penal Code, relating to trespass."

As used in this part, “open educational resources” are high-quality teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license, such as a Creative Commons license, that permits their free use and repurposing by others, and may include other resources that are legally available and free of cost to students. “Open educational resources” include, but are not limited to, full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, faculty-created content, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.
67424.
(a) In order to participate in the program, the local academic senate of a campus of the California State University or the California Community Colleges shall do both of the following:
(1) Adopt a local campus resolution to increase student access to high-quality open educational resources and reduce the cost of textbooks and supplies for students in course sections for which open educational resources are to be adopted to accomplish cost savings for students.
(2) Approve a plan, in collaboration with students and campus administration, that describes evidence of the faculty’s commitment and readiness to effectively use grant funds to support faculty adoption of open educational resources.

(E) The plan will identify the amount of the grant requested. The amount of the grant requested shall be equal to, or less than, the number of course sections in which both open educational resources will be adopted and cost savings for the course section will be greater than 30 percent, multiplied by one thousand dollars ($1,000). The amount requested shall not be greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). A plan shall commit to achieving greater than 30 percent cost savings in at least 10 course sections.

The California Open Education Resources Council may award up to 100 initial grants.
(B) If the total amount requested in applications received pursuant to subparagraph (A) is equal to or less than two million dollars ($2,000,000), the California Open Education Resources Council shall make grants for each approved application equal to the amount requested in the application. If the total amount requested in applications received pursuant to subparagraph (A) exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000), the California Open Education Resources Council shall make grants for the full amount requested in approved applications on a competitive basis based on the strength of the evidence provided of faculty commitment to the adoption of open educational resources.
(3) Each application approved by the California Open Education Resources Council shall be submitted by the council to the Chancellor of the California State University no later than 30 days after the council approves the application. The chancellor shall award grants to recipients in accordance with this section.

It is the intent of the Legislature that bonus grants support each campus’ adoption of open educational resources for at least double the number of course sections, and with at least 30 percent cost savings for each of these course sections, as accomplished by the campus’ approved plan for its initial grant.
(7) If the total amount requested in applications for bonus grants exceeds the total amount of funds available, the California Open Educational Resources Council shall award grants on a competitive basis to approved applications for the full amount of the initial grant based on the overall percentage savings achieved by the initial plan in the courses covered by the plan.
(8) It is the intent of the Legislature that initial and bonus grants provide the impetus for campuses to adopt, and continue to use, open educational resources as course materials.
(d) The California Open Online Library for Education, in consultation with the Intersegmental Committee of Academic Senates, shall report to the Legislature, in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, before September 1 each year, commencing in 2018, as to whether the grants are increasing the rate of adoption of open educational resources and decreasing textbook costs for college students.

Existing law, with regard to a transfer fee imposed upon real property on or after January 1, 2008, requires the person or entity imposing the transfer fee, as a condition of payment of the fee, to record a specified document describing the transfer fee concurrently with the instrument creating the transfer fee requirement. Existing law requires these recorded documents to include information on the amount of the fee and actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property, among other things. Existing law requires a transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make a specified disclosure regarding those fees.
This bill would specify that the required information on the recorded document include the method for calculating the amount of the transfer fee, if not a flat amount or a percentage of the sales price, and include the actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property if the amount of the fee is based on the price of the real property. The bill would also require the transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make the specified disclosure regarding those fees if the recorded document describing the transfer fees has not already been provided. The bill would also clarify the definition of a transfer fee.
Existing law excludes from the definition of a transfer fee any fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, and that provides a prospective transferee notice of specified information, including the amount or method of calculation of the fee.
This bill would specify that the information shall be set forth in a single document and may not be incorporated by reference from any other document.
This bill would provide that a fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is not separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, or that incorporates by reference from another document, constitutes a transfer fee for the purposes of requirements relating to these fees. The bill would make unenforceable a transfer fee recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that complies with the provisions described above and that incorporates by reference from another document unless it is recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2016, in a single document that complies with the provisions described above.

(a)For purposes of this chapter, “pupils of limited academic English proficiency” is defined as pupils who do not have the clearly developed academic English language skills of comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing necessary to receive instruction in English at a level substantially equivalent to pupils of the same age or grade whose primary language is also English.
(b)For purposes of this chapter, “academic English” and “academic language” shall have the same meaning and are defined as the oral, written, auditory, and visual language proficiency required to learn effectively in school and academic programs. Academic English and academic language is the language used in classroom lessons, books, tests, and assignments, and it is the language that pupils are expected to learn and achieve fluency in. Frequently contrasted with “conversational” or “social” language, academic language includes a variety of formal-language skills such as vocabulary, grammar, punctuation, syntax, discipline-specific terminology, or rhetorical conventions, that allow pupils to acquire knowledge and academic skills while also successfully navigating school policies, assignments, expectations, and cultural norms.
350.1.
(a)On or before September 1, 2016, the Superintendent, in consultation with the department and local educational agencies, shall develop a formal process to identify pupils who may meet the definition in subdivision (a) of Section 350.
(b)The process may, at a minimum, provide special consideration to pupils who meet any of the following criteria:
(1)Scores in the lowest achievement levels on the Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments.
(2)Receives less than a passing grade on one or more consecutive progress and report cards in English language arts.
(3)Is identified by teachers or faculty members as a candidate who may meet one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (1) or (2).
350.2.
(a)On or before January 1, 2017, the department, in consultation with local educational agencies, shall develop a study on best practices for providing instruction to pupils of limited academic English proficiency, and shall provide this study to members of the Legislature, the Office of the Legislative Analyst, and the Governor. The study shall include, but not be limited to, information relating to all of the following:
(1)Existing state and local programs.
(2)Effective pedagogical and instructional methods for pupils of limited academic English proficiency.
(3)Professional development and training needs for teachers who would be likely to provide instruction to pupils of limited academic English proficiency.
(b)The study required to be submitted to the Legislature pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
350.3.
(a)Notwithstanding any other law, including Article 3.5 (commencing with Section 313) of Chapter 3, on or before September 1, 2017, the department shall develop an assessment tool to determine the proficiency level of pupils of limited academic English proficiency identified through the formal process, pursuant to Section 350.1, for purposes of identifying an adequate method of instruction for these pupils.
(b)The department, with the approval of the state board, shall establish procedures for conducting the assessment required pursuant to subdivision (a) and for the designation of a pupil of limited academic English proficiency to academic English proficient.
350.4.
(a)Notwithstanding any other law, including Article 3.5 (commencing with Section 313) of Chapter 3, commencing with the 2018–19 school year, the assessment developed pursuant to Section 350.3 shall be conducted upon initial enrollment or as early as possible after enrollment, in order to provide information to determine if the pupil is a pupil of limited academic English proficiency, and annually thereafter during a period of time determined by the Superintendent and the state board. The annual assessments shall continue until the pupil is designated as academic English proficient pursuant to Section 350.5.
(b)For purposes of this section, school districts may utilize a pupil scoring at the highest achievement levels of 3 or higher on the Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments to designate the pupil as academic English proficient. If a pupil is still performing at a level of limited academic English proficiency after the grade 8 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments, the school district shall provide targeted resources with the goal of the pupil scoring at the level of 3 or higher on the grade 11 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments.
(c)The assessments conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted in a manner consistent with federal statutes and regulations.
350.5.
Notwithstanding any other law, including Article 3.5 (commencing with Section 313) of Chapter 3, the Superintendent shall develop a procedure to designate a pupil of limited academic English proficiency as academic English proficient. The designation procedure developed by the Superintendent shall utilize multiple criteria in determining whether to designate a pupil as proficient in academic English, including, but not limited to, all of the following:
(a)Assessment of academic language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument.
(b)Teacher evaluation, including, but not limited to, a review of the pupil’s curriculum mastery.
(c)Parental opinion and consultation.
(d)Comparison of the performance of the pupil in basic skills against an empirically established range of performance in basic skills based upon the performance of academic English proficient pupils of the same age, that demonstrates whether the pupil is sufficiently proficient in academic English to participate effectively in a curriculum designed for pupils of the same age.
350.6.
This chapter does not preclude a school district or county office of education from testing pupils of limited academic English proficiency more than once in a school year if the school district or county office of education chooses to do so.
SECTION 1.
Section 314 is added to the Education Code, to read:
314.
(a) Contingent on the enactment of an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or related legislation for the purpose of implementing this section, the Los Angeles Unified School District, in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles Center X, shall conduct an evaluation of the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Academic English Mastery Program. This evaluation shall include data collection and analysis, and shall address policy questions regarding identification, assessment, instruction, and professional development of, and curriculum and definitions of proficiency for, pupils of limited academic English proficiency. The evaluation shall be completed by ____ and shall be submitted to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature.
(b) This section is repealed on January 1, 20____.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the State Department of Education, with the approval of the State Board of Education, to establish procedures for conducting an assessment of pupils who are English learners in order to determine the level of English proficiency. Existing law requires each school district that has one or more pupils who are English learners, to assess the English language development of each pupil. Existing law requires this assessment to be conducted upon initial enrollment, and annually thereafter, during a period determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the state board.
This bill would, notwithstanding the above provisions, require the department, on or before September 1, 2017, to develop an assessment tool to determine the proficiency level of pupils of limited academic English proficiency, as defined, and as determined by a formal process that the bill would require the Superintendent to develop in consultation with the department and local educational agencies, as provided. The bill would require the assessment to be conducted upon a pupil’s initial enrollment or as early as possible after enrollment, in order to provide information to determine if the pupil is a pupil of limited academic English proficiency, and annually thereafter, during a period of time determined by the Superintendent and the state board. The bill would require the annual assessments to continue until the pupil is designated as academic English proficient, as provided. The bill would require, if a pupil is still performing at a level of limited academic English proficiency after the grade 8 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments, the school district to provide targeted resources with the goal of the pupil scoring at the level of 3 or higher on the grade 11 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments.
By creating new duties for a local educational agency, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, contingent on the enactment of an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or related legislation for the purpose of implementing these provisions, require the Los Angeles Unified School District, in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles Center X, to conduct an evaluation of the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Academic English Mastery Program, as specified. The bill would require the evaluation to be completed by an unspecified date and submitted to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on the Los Angeles Unified School District, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 350) to Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 1
and repeal Section 314
of the Education Code, relating to English proficiency."
630,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California relies on three separate state agencies to administer and enforce its major taxes.
(b) To obtain assistance and comply with California’s tax laws, policies, and procedures, many taxpayers must interact with all three agencies, and frequently with multiple departments within those agencies.
(c) While this system has performed reasonably well in many respects, the multiagency nature of the system is prone to certain inherent problems, difficulties, and inefficiencies, and is particularly complex for taxpayers required to comply with California’s tax laws.
(d) Over the past decades, numerous reports have been prepared and various legislative proposals have been considered on the topic of coordination and cooperation among these three agencies. The focus of these efforts range from relatively minor aspects of increased cooperation to proposals for full consolidation of the agencies under “one roof.”
(e) Focusing on the customer should be a core element of California’s tax administration. Taxpayers should not have to understand complex government structures and relationships in order to interact with the government, particularly in a sensitive area like taxes.
(f) The California Tax Service Center, available at www.taxes.ca.gov, provides an assortment of independent departmental forms, returns, and links, tied together by a common homepage on the Internet, and is intended to provide California taxpayers with resources and educational programs with a goal as a one-stop tax assistance hub.
(g) The California Tax Service Center can be used to better serve California’s taxpaying community by virtually consolidating the three agencies’ operations to enable them to appear as one unified organization with the goal of providing a seamless experience for taxpayers in their online interactions with the agencies.
(h) It is therefore in California’s best interest to develop an Internet Web-based, taxpayer-focused system that virtually consolidates the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department. In developing a taxpayer-focused system, the fundamental objective should be a platform that provides an integrated experience for taxpayers, to enable online self-service access with a single logon for all three agencies, and to provide pertinent and essential information that will enable taxpayers to satisfy their payment and reporting obligations, obtain real-time information pertinent to their individual accounts, and provide assistance that will enable taxpayers to achieve optimum compliance with California’s complex tax system.
SEC. 2.
Section 39 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read:
39.
(a) (1) On or before January 1, 2017, the board, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department shall collaborate and focus their current and future information technology efforts to conduct a feasibility study on the development of a single Internet Web-based portal that virtually consolidates the agencies to enable online, self-service access through a single logon for taxpayers to electronically file returns, submit forms or other information, determine account balances and due dates of taxes, remit amounts due, identify the status of any appeal, claim for refund, request for relief of interest or penalty, and any other information the agencies deem helpful to the taxpayer to assist in compliance with the state’s tax laws. The feasibility study shall consider the California Tax Service Center Internet Web site in its analysis.
(2) The feasibility study shall be conducted with the existing budgets of the board, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department. An appropriation shall not be made by the Legislature to fund the feasibility study.
(3) The feasibility study shall be submitted to the Legislature no later than six months after the study is completed and shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(4) This subdivision shall become inoperative on January 1, 2020, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.
(b) As part of this effort, upon a joint determination by the agencies that a need exists to improve cost-effective services to taxpayers and an appropriation by the Legislature, these agencies shall also consolidate forms, applications, and other documents to reduce or eliminate the number of multiple submissions of the same information by taxpayers.
SECTION 1.
Section 34 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code
is amended to read:
34.
Whenever an amount of money paid by a person to the state or any of its agencies includes a sum that can be identified as in fact intended as payment of a locally administered tax that should have been paid directly to a city, city and county, county or district within the state, the state or its agency may pay the amount to the local government entitled thereto and notify the payor of its action. This procedure, however, shall not be followed by the state or any of its agencies unless the governing body of the local government concerned has, by resolution, agreed with respect to those payments that a timely payment received by the state or its agency will be regarded as a timely payment to the local government concerned, and that it will process all claims with respect to that payment in the same manner as though the payment had been made to it in the first instance.","Existing law imposes various taxes that are administered by the Franchise Tax Board, the State Board of Equalization, and the Employment Development Department.
This bill would require, on or before January 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department to collaborate and focus the agencies’ current and future information technology efforts to conduct a feasibility study on the development of a single Internet Web site portal that virtually consolidates the agencies to enable online, self-service access to the agencies, as provided, and to submit the study to the Legislature. The bill would also require these agencies, upon a joint determination by the agencies that a need exists to improve cost-effective services to taxpayers and an appropriation by the Legislature, to consolidate forms, applications, and other documents to reduce or eliminate the number of multiple submissions of the same information by taxpayers.
Under existing law, whenever an amount of money paid by a person to the state includes a sum that can be identified as intended as payment of a locally administered tax that should have been paid directly to a local government within the state, the state is authorized to pay the amount to the local government and notify the payor of its action. However, existing law prohibits this procedure from being followed unless the governing body of the local government has, by resolution, agreed with respect to those payments that a timely payment received by the state will be regarded as a timely payment to the local government concerned, as provided.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","An act to
amend Section 34 of
add Section 39 to
the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."
631,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 8670.40 of the Government Code is amended to read:
8670.40.
(a) The State Board of Equalization shall collect a fee in an amount determined by the administrator to be sufficient to pay the reasonable regulatory costs to carry out the purposes set forth in subdivision (e), and a reasonable reserve for contingencies. The annual assessment shall not exceed six and one-half cents ($0.065) per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products. The oil spill prevention and administration fee shall be based on each barrel of crude oil or petroleum products, as described in subdivision (b).
(b) (1) The oil spill prevention and administration fee shall be imposed upon a person owning crude oil at the time that the crude oil is received at a marine terminal, by any mode of delivery that passed over, across, under, or through waters of the state, from within or outside the state, and upon a person who owns petroleum products at the time that those petroleum products are received at a marine terminal, by any mode of delivery that passed over, across, under, or through waters of the state, from outside this state. The fee shall be collected by the marine terminal operator from the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products for each barrel of crude oil or petroleum products received.
(2) The oil spill prevention and administration fee shall be imposed upon a person owning crude oil or petroleum products at the time that the crude oil or petroleum products are received at a refinery within the state by any mode of delivery that passed over, across, under, or through waters of the state, whether from within or outside the state. The refinery shall collect the fee from the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products for each barrel received.
(3) (A) There is a rebuttable presumption that crude oil or petroleum products received at a marine terminal or a refinery have passed over, across, under, or through waters of the state. This presumption may be overcome by a marine terminal operator, refinery operator, or owner of the crude oil or petroleum products by showing that the crude oil or petroleum products did not pass over, across, under, or through waters of the state. Evidence to rebut the presumption may include, but shall not be limited to, documentation, including shipping documents, bills of lading, highway maps, rail maps, transportation maps, related transportation receipts, or another medium, that shows the crude oil or petroleum products did not pass over, across, under, or through waters of the state.
(B) Notwithstanding the petition for redetermination and claim for refund provisions of the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law (Part 24 (commencing with Section 46001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), the State Board of Equalization shall not do either of the following:
(i) Accept or consider a petition for redetermination of fees determined pursuant to this section if the petition is founded upon the grounds that the crude oil or petroleum products did or did not pass over, across, under, or through waters of the state.
(ii) Accept or consider a claim for a refund of fees paid pursuant to this section if the claim is founded upon the grounds that the crude oil or petroleum products did or did not pass over, across, under, or through waters of the state.
(C) The State Board of Equalization shall forward to the administrator an appeal of a redetermination or a claim for a refund of fees that is based on the grounds that the crude oil or petroleum products did or did not pass over, across, under, or through waters of the state.
(4) The fees shall be remitted to the State Board of Equalization by the refinery operator or the marine terminal operator on the 25th day of the month based upon the number of barrels of crude oil or petroleum products received at a refinery or marine terminal during the preceding month. A fee shall not be imposed pursuant to this section with respect to crude oil or petroleum products if the person who would be liable for that fee, or responsible for its collection, establishes that the fee has already been collected by a refinery or marine terminal operator registered under this chapter or paid to the State Board of Equalization with respect to the crude oil or petroleum product.
(5) The oil spill prevention and administration fee shall not be collected by a marine terminal operator or refinery operator or imposed on the owner of crude oil or petroleum products if the fee has been previously collected or paid on the crude oil or petroleum products at another marine terminal or refinery. A marine terminal operator or a refinery operator receiving petroleum products derived from crude oil refined in the state may presume the fee has been previously collected.
(6) An owner of crude oil or petroleum products is liable for the fee until it has been paid to the State Board of Equalization, except that payment to a refinery operator or marine terminal operator registered under this chapter is sufficient to relieve the owner from further liability for the fee.
(7) On or before January 20, the administrator shall annually prepare a plan that projects revenues and expenses over three fiscal years, including the current year. Based on the plan, the administrator shall set the fee so that projected revenues, including any interest and inflation, are equivalent to expenses as reflected in the current Budget Act and in the proposed budget submitted by the Governor. In setting the fee, the administrator may allow for a surplus if the administrator finds that revenues will be exhausted during the period covered by the plan or that the surplus is necessary to cover possible contingencies. The administrator shall notify the State Board of Equalization of the adjusted fee rate, which shall be rounded to no more than four decimal places, to be effective the first day of the month beginning not less than 30 days from the date of the notification.
(c) The moneys collected pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be deposited into the fund.
(d) The State Board of Equalization shall collect the fee and adopt regulations for implementing the fee collection program.
(e) The fee described in this section shall be collected solely for all of the following purposes:
(1) To implement oil spill prevention programs through rules, regulations, leasing policies, guidelines, and inspections and to implement research into prevention and control technology.
(2) To carry out studies that may lead to improved oil spill prevention and response.
(3) To finance environmental and economic studies relating to the effects of oil spills.
(4) To implement, install, and maintain emergency programs, equipment, and facilities to respond to, contain, and clean up oil spills and to ensure that those operations will be carried out as intended.
(5) To reimburse the State Board of Equalization for its reasonable costs incurred to implement this chapter and to carry out Part 24 (commencing with Section 46001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(6) To fund the Oiled Wildlife Care Network pursuant to Section 8670.40.5.
(f) The moneys deposited in the fund shall not be used for responding to a spill.
(g) The moneys deposited in the fund shall not be used to provide a loan to any other fund.
(h) The amendments to this section enacted in Section 37 of Chapter 35 of the Statutes of 2014 shall become operative September 18, 2014.

Section 46008 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read:

“Barrel” means 42 gallons of crude oil or petroleum products.

SEC. 4.
Section 46101 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
46101.
(a) Every person who operates a refinery in this state, a marine terminal in waters of the state, or operates a pipeline to transport crude oil out of the state or petroleum products into the state shall register with the board for the purposes of Section 8670.48 of the Government Code.
(b) Every person who operates a refinery in this state or a marine terminal in waters of the state shall register with the board for the purposes of Section 8670.40 of the Government Code.
SEC. 5.
It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Board of Equalization collect the oil spill prevention and administration fee imposed on crude oil or petroleum products pursuant to Section 8670.40 of the Government Code only upon first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 8670.40 of the Government Code, and not upon subsequent movement of that same crude oil or petroleum products derived after that first delivery.","(1) The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act generally requires the administrator for oil spill response, acting at the direction of the Governor, to implement activities relating to oil spill response, including emergency drills and preparedness, and oil spill containment and cleanup, and to represent the state in any coordinated response efforts with the federal government.
The act imposes an oil spill prevention and administration fee in an amount determined by the administrator to be sufficient to implement oil spill prevention activities, but not to exceed $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products, and to be remitted to the State Board of Equalization. The act requires the oil spill prevention and administration fee to be imposed upon a person owning crude oil or petroleum products at the time that the crude oil or petroleum products are received at a marine terminal or refinery by specified modes of delivery from within or outside the state, as specified. The act prohibits the fee from being collected by a marine terminal operator or refinery operator or imposed on the owner of crude oil or petroleum products if the fee has been previously collected or paid on the crude oil or petroleum products at another marine terminal or refinery and, in that case, requires a marine terminal operator, refinery operator, or owner of crude oil or petroleum products to demonstrate that the fee has already been paid.
This bill instead would authorize a marine terminal operator or a refinery operator receiving petroleum products derived from crude oil refined in the state to presume the fee has been previously collected. The bill would also no longer require the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products to remit the fee to the board. The bill would make conforming changes.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the board collect the oil spill prevention and administration fee only upon first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal and not upon the subsequent movement of that same crude oil or petroleum products following that first delivery.
(2) Existing law requires every person who operates a refinery in this state, a marine terminal in waters of the state, or a pipeline to transport crude oil or petroleum products out of the state to register with the board. Existing law defines, for the purposes of the board’s administration of those provisions, certain terms, including, among others, oil.
This bill instead would require every person who operates a refinery in this state, a marine terminal in waters of the state, or a pipeline to transport crude oil out of the state or petroleum products into the state to register with the board for the purposes of the oil spill prevention and administration fee and the uniform oil spill response fee, as applicable. The bill would delete the definition of oil, and would define barrel to mean 42 gallons of crude oil or petroleum products for these purposes.","An act to amend Section 8670.40 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 46101 of, to add Section 46008 to, and to repeal Section 46018 of, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to oil spills."

633,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) All pupils deserve and need safe and supportive school environments in which to learn.
(2) Despite much progress, California lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) pupils often face verbal, physical, and online harassment, which has significant effects on their academic achievement.
(3) In the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) 2013 National School Climate Survey, 91 percent of California LGBTQ pupils reported hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks, 7 in 10 reported being called names or threatened based on their sexual orientation, nearly one-third reported physical harassment or assault, and 46 percent reported cyberbullying.
(4) These problems have direct effects on pupils’ school performance. GLSEN survey data shows that the average grade point average for LGBTQ pupils who have experienced harassment is significantly lower than for LGBTQ pupils who have not, and that 30 percent of LGBTQ pupils report frequently skipping class or missing whole days of school because they felt unsafe at school.
(5) In spite of these problems, research has shown that LGBTQ pupils who are harassed or assaulted in school do not report these incidents to school staff, primarily because they believe school staff will not do anything about the problem.
(6) Creating supportive learning environments for LGBTQ pupils improves pupil performance. Pupils in schools with peer support clubs report less harassment and assault, are more likely to report incidents when they occur, and are less likely to miss school because of safety concerns.
(7) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors and funds local efforts to provide professional development for educators on safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ pupils, foster schoolsite resources such as Gay Straight Alliance clubs and “safe spaces” for LGBTQ pupils, and promote referrals to school and community health professionals with experience providing support to LGBTQ pupils.
(8) CDC data shows that only 50 percent of California schools facilitate access to schoolsite and community health resources for LGBTQ pupils, and only 39 percent have peer support clubs.
(b) The Legislature therefore encourages school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide information on existing schoolsite and community resources as required by subdivision (d) of Section 234.1 of the Education Code as part of a more comprehensive effort to educate school staff on the support of LGBTQ pupils.

The department, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 64001, shall monitor adherence to the requirements of Chapter 5.3 (commencing with Section 4900) of Division 1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and this chapter as part of its regular monitoring and review of local educational agencies, commonly known as the Categorical Program Monitoring process. The department shall assess whether local educational agencies have done all of the following:
(a) Adopted a policy that prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code and Section 220 of this code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The policy shall include a statement that the policy applies to all acts related to school activity or school attendance occurring within a school under the jurisdiction of the superintendent of the school district.
(b) Adopted a process for receiving and investigating complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on any of the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code and Section 220 of this code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The complaint process shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1) A requirement that, if school personnel witness an act of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying, they shall take immediate steps to intervene when safe to do so.
(2) A timeline to investigate and resolve complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying that shall be followed by all schools under the jurisdiction of the school district.
(3) An appeal process afforded to the complainant should he or she disagree with the resolution of a complaint filed pursuant to this section.
(4) All forms developed pursuant to this process shall be translated pursuant to Section 48985.
(c) Publicized antidiscrimination, antiharassment, anti-intimidation, and antibullying policies adopted pursuant to subdivision (a), including information about the manner in which to file a complaint, to pupils, parents, employees, agents of the governing board, and the general public. The information shall be translated pursuant to Section 48985.
(d) Provided, incident to the publicizing described in subdivision (c), to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, who are employed by the local educational agency, information on existing schoolsite and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) pupils. Schoolsite resources may include, but are not limited to, peer support or affinity clubs and organizations, safe spaces for LGBTQ pupils, counseling services, staff who have received antibias or other training aimed at supporting these pupils or who serve as designated support to these pupils, health and other curriculum materials that are inclusive of, and relevant to, these pupils, online training developed pursuant to Section 32283.5, and other policies adopted pursuant to this article, including related complaint procedures. Community resources may include, but are not limited to, community-based organizations that provide support to LGBTQ pupils and their families, and physical and mental health providers with experience or training in treating or supporting these pupils.
(e) Posted the policy established pursuant to subdivision (a) in all schools and offices, including staff lounges and pupil government meeting rooms.
(f) Maintained documentation of complaints and their resolution for a minimum of one review cycle.
(g) Ensured that complainants are protected from retaliation and that the identity of a complainant alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying remains confidential, as appropriate.
(h) Identified a responsible local educational agency officer for ensuring school district or county office of education compliance with the requirements of Chapter 5.3 (commencing with Section 4900) of Division 1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and this chapter.","Existing law establishes the system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and provides for the establishment of local educational agencies to operate these schools and provide instruction to pupils. Existing law states the policy of the State of California to afford all persons in public schools, regardless of their disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other specified characteristic, equal rights and opportunities in the educational institutions of the state. Existing law, the Safe Place to Learn Act, requires the State Department of Education, as part of its regular monitoring and review of a local educational agency, to assess whether the local educational agency has, among other things, adopted a policy that prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying, as specified, and has publicized that policy to pupils, parents, employees, agents of the governing board, and the general public.
This bill would require the department to also assess whether the local educational agency has provided to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, information on existing schoolsite and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning pupils, as specified.","An act to amend Section 234.1 of the Education Code, relating to safe schools."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California relies on private nonprofit colleges and universities accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) to help meet the state’s higher education needs.
(b) The maximum award for Cal Grant students attending WASC accredited private nonprofit colleges and universities has not increased since its maximum of $9,708 in 1999:
(1) It was cut by almost 15 percent for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 cohorts.
(2) It was cut by 5 percent for new and renewal students for the 2012–13 award year, and by an additional 1.5 percent in the 2013–14 award year. It is scheduled for an additional cut of 11.3 percent in the 2015–16 award year for new awardees.
(3) If the 2000 Cal Grant maximum award had kept up with the rate of inflation, the 2014 award level would be $13,346.
(4) The proposed maximum award for the 2015–16 award year will be the lowest amount California has invested in academically qualified, low-income students that attend private nonprofit WASC accredited institutions since the 1997–98 academic year.
(c) The Cal Grant Program effectively and successfully helps California’s private nonprofit colleges and universities to recruit, retain, and graduate historically underrepresented students from low-income California families.
(d) Predictable and stable funding formulas and eligibility requirements ensure that the state maximizes its investment by allowing families to better plan and pay for higher education, in addition to incentivizing private nonprofit colleges and universities to enroll more low-income Californians.
(e) Legislative action is needed to adopt a reasonable and viable formula that supports predictability and parity for California students at private nonprofit colleges.

(II) The department shall approve an application to amend an existing contract if the plan is modified pursuant to Section 8340.3.
(III) The contract of a department contractor who does not elect to request an amendment to its contract remains operative and enforceable.

Existing law does not reflect the fiscal reality of living in the County of Alameda, a high-cost county where the cost of living is well beyond the state median level, resulting in reduced access to quality child care. In recognition of the unintended consequences of living in a high-cost county, this act is necessary to provide children and families in the County of Alameda proper access to child care through an individualized county child care subsidy plan.","The Child Care and Development Services Act has a purpose of providing a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective system of child care and development services for children from infancy to 13 years of age and their parents, including a full range of supervision, health, and support services through full- and part-time programs. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop standards for the implementation of quality child care programs. Existing law authorizes the County of San Mateo, as a pilot project, to develop an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as provided.

The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.
SECTION 1.
Section 82015 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
82015.
(a)“Contribution” means a payment, a forgiveness of a loan, a payment of a loan by a third party, or an enforceable promise to make a payment except to the extent that full and adequate consideration is received, unless it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that it is not made for political purposes.
(b)(1)A payment made at the behest of a committee, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 82013, is a contribution to the committee unless full and adequate consideration is received from the committee for making the payment.
(2)A payment made at the behest of a candidate is a contribution to that candidate, unless the criteria in either subparagraph (A) or (B) are satisfied:
(A)Full and adequate consideration is received from the candidate.
(B)It is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the payment was made for purposes unrelated to his or her candidacy for elective office. The following types of payments are presumed to be for purposes unrelated to a candidate’s candidacy for elective office:
(i)A payment made principally for personal purposes, in which case it may be considered a gift under the provisions of Section 82028. Payments that are otherwise subject to the limits of Section 86203 are presumed to be principally for personal purposes.
(ii)A payment made by a state, local, or federal governmental agency or by a nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iii)A payment not covered by clause (i), made principally for legislative, governmental, or charitable purposes, in which case it is neither a gift nor a contribution. However, payments of this type that are made at the behest of a candidate who is an elected officer shall be reported within 30 days following the date on which the payment or payments equal or exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) in the aggregate from the same source in the same calendar year in which they are made. The report shall be filed by the elected officer with the elected officer’s agency and shall be a public record subject to inspection and copying pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 81008. The report shall contain the following information: name of payor, address of payor, amount of the payment, date or dates the payment or payments were made, the name and address of the payee, a brief description of the goods or services provided or purchased, if any, and a description of the specific purpose or event for which the payment or payments were made. Once the five-thousand-dollar ($5,000) aggregate threshold from a single source has been reached for a calendar year, all payments for the calendar year made by that source shall be disclosed within 30 days after the date the threshold was reached or the payment was made, whichever occurs later. Within 30 days after receipt of the report, state agencies shall forward a copy of these reports to the Commission, and local agencies shall forward a copy of these reports to the officer with whom elected officers of that agency file their campaign statements.
(C)For purposes of subparagraph (B), a payment is made for purposes related to a candidate’s candidacy for elective office if all or a portion of the payment is used for election-related activities. For purposes of this subparagraph, “election-related activities” shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i)Communications that contain express advocacy of the nomination or election of the candidate or the defeat of his or her opponent.
(ii)Communications that contain reference to the candidate’s candidacy for elective office, the candidate’s election campaign, or the candidate’s or his or her opponent’s qualifications for elective office.
(iii)Solicitation of contributions to the candidate or to third persons for use in support of the candidate or in opposition to his or her opponent.

(v)Recruiting or coordinating campaign activities of campaign volunteers on behalf of the candidate.

(viii)Communications directed to voters or potential voters as part of activities encouraging or assisting persons to vote if the communication contains express advocacy of the nomination or election of the candidate or the defeat of his or her opponent.
(D)A contribution made at the behest of a candidate for a different candidate or to a committee not controlled by the behesting candidate is not a contribution to the behesting candidate.
(3)A payment made at the behest of a member of the Public Utilities Commission, made principally for legislative, governmental, or charitable purposes, is not a contribution. However, payments of this type shall be reported within 30 days following the date on which the payment or payments equal or exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) in the aggregate from the same source in the same calendar year in which they are made. The report shall be filed by the member with the Public Utilities Commission and shall be a public record subject to inspection and copying pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 81008. The report shall contain the following information: name of payor, address of payor, amount of the payment, date or dates the payment or payments were made, the name and address of the payee, a brief description of the goods or services provided or purchased, if any, and a description of the specific purpose or event for which the payment or payments were made. Once the five-thousand-dollar ($5,000) aggregate threshold from a single source has been reached for a calendar year, all payments for the calendar year made by that source shall be disclosed within 30 days after the date the threshold was reached or the payment was made, whichever occurs later. Within 30 days after receipt of the report, the Public Utilities Commission shall forward a copy of these reports to the Fair Political Practices Commission.
(c)“Contribution” includes the purchase of tickets for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies, and similar fundraising events; the candidate’s own money or property used on behalf of his or her candidacy, other than personal funds of the candidate used to pay either a filing fee for a declaration of candidacy or a candidate statement prepared pursuant to Section 13307 of the Elections Code; the granting of discounts or rebates not extended to the public generally or the granting of discounts or rebates by television and radio stations and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for the same office; the payment of compensation by any person for the personal services or expenses of any other person if the services are rendered or expenses incurred on behalf of a candidate or committee without payment of full and adequate consideration.
(d)“Contribution” further includes any transfer of anything of value received by a committee from another committee, unless full and adequate consideration is received.
(e)“Contribution” does not include amounts received pursuant to an enforceable promise to the extent those amounts have been previously reported as a contribution. However, the fact that those amounts have been received shall be indicated in the appropriate campaign statement.
(f)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), “contribution” does not include a payment made by an occupant of a home or office for costs related to any meeting or fundraising event held in the occupant’s home or office if the costs for the meeting or fundraising event are five hundred dollars ($500) or less.
(2)“Contribution” includes a payment made by a lobbyist or a cohabitant of a lobbyist for costs related to a fundraising event held at the home of the lobbyist, including the value of the use of the home as a fundraising event venue. A payment described in this paragraph shall be attributable to the lobbyist for purposes of Section 85702.
(3)“Contribution” includes a payment made by a lobbying firm for costs related to a fundraising event held at the office of the lobbying firm, including the value of the use of the office as a fundraising event venue.
(g)Notwithstanding the foregoing definition of “contribution,” the term does not include volunteer personal services or payments made by any individual for his or her own travel expenses if the payments are made voluntarily without any understanding or agreement that they shall be, directly or indirectly, repaid to him or her.
(h)“Contribution” further includes the payment of public moneys by a state or local governmental agency for a communication to the public that satisfies both of the following:
(1)The communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a clearly identified measure, or, taken as a whole and in context, unambiguously urges a particular result in an election.
(2)The communication is made at the behest of the affected candidate or committee.
(i)“Contribution” further includes a payment made by a person to a multipurpose organization as defined and described in Section 84222.","Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign conduct, including requiring certain disclosures in advertisements made for campaign purposes. Existing law also prohibits an incumbent from sending a newsletter or other mass mailing at public expense.
This bill would define a “public advertisement” as an advertisement that is paid for from the funds of a state or local public entity. This bill would prohibit a person or entity from disseminating, broadcasting, or otherwise publishing a public advertisement, as defined, within 90 days of an election if the advertisement features, as defined, a candidate who will appear on the ballot at that election.
Existing law makes a willful violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 a misdemeanor and subject offenders to criminal penalties.
The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating additional crimes.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.
Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing, including requiring the reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures and imposing other reporting and recordkeeping requirements on campaign committees. The act provides that a payment made at the behest of a candidate is a contribution to that candidate, unless full and adequate consideration is received from the candidate or it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the payment was made for purposes unrelated to his or her candidacy for elective office.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that payment provision.","An act to

the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the California Community Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensing and regulation of community care facilities, as defined, by the State Department of Social Services. A violation of the act is a misdemeanor. Existing law exempts recovery houses providing group living arrangements for persons recovering from alcoholism or drug addiction from the act.
This bill would require a recovery house that is owned or operated, as defined, by a community care facility licensed pursuant to the act and that functions as an integral component of that community care facility to be deemed a facility that provides treatment or services under the license of the community care facility. The bill would subject a facility under that license to the inspection and enforcement provisions of the act.
Because this bill would extend the application of a crime under these provisions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1505 of, and to add Section 1534.3 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to recovery houses."

SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that there is a process that management and supervisors in a state health care facility are required to follow to avoid on-the-spot mandatory overtime of any nurse or certified nursing assistant (CNA) whose regularly scheduled work shift is complete, and to prevent circumstances where an employee is stopped at the gate of, for example, a Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services facility, and is instructed to return to work at the end of the employee’s regularly scheduled work shift. It is the intent of the Legislature to prohibit a state facility that employs nurses or CNAs from using mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool, or as an excuse for fulfilling an operational need that results from a management failure to properly staff those state facilities.

(j) It is not a defense to a violation of this section that no image, recording, or physical impression was captured or sold.
(k) For the purposes of this section, “for a commercial purpose” means any act done with the expectation of a sale, financial gain, or other consideration. A visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression shall not be found to have been, or intended to have been, captured for a commercial purpose unless it is intended to be, or was in fact, sold, published, or transmitted.

If any provision of this section or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.","Under existing law, except as specified, a person is liable for physical invasion of privacy when that person knowingly enters onto the land of another person without permission or otherwise trespasses to capture any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of a person engaging in a private, personal, or familial activity and the invasion occurs in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person. Under existing law, a person is liable for constructive invasion of privacy for the same activity, as specified, through the use of any device, regardless of whether there is a physical trespass. Existing law subjects a person who commits physical or constructive invasion of privacy to specified damages and civil fines.
This bill would expand liability for physical invasion of privacy to additionally include a person knowingly entering into the airspace above the land of another person without permission, as provided.","An act to amend Section 1708.8 of the Civil Code, relating to privacy."

Section 47020 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:
47020.
(a) An operator of a certified farmers’ market shall annually register with the department by applying for and obtaining a certificate from the county agricultural commissioner’s office in the county in which the certified farmers’ market is located. The application shall include the times and location of the market, the name and contact information for the operator of the market, and the agent for service of process for the operator. Upon approval of an application, the county agricultural commissioner shall issue to the operator a certified farmers’ market certificate.
(b) A certified farmers’ market certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner shall be valid for 12 months from the date of issue, and may be renewed annually thereafter. The county agricultural commissioner shall inspect every certified farmers’ market within his or her jurisdiction at least once for every six months of operation. At the time of application or renewal, the county agricultural commissioner shall provide a schedule of fees that reflects an estimate of expenses for inspections and may charge a certification and inspection fee equal to the actual expenses incurred.
(c) (1) (A) Before selling at a certified farmers’ market, a producer shall register with the department by applying for and obtaining a certificate from the county agricultural commissioner’s office in the county in which the producer’s land or facility is located. The application shall include a declaration by the producer that he or she is knowledgeable of and intends to produce in accordance with good agricultural practices, as outlined in the Small Farm Food Safety Guidelines published by the department. Upon approval of an application, the county agricultural commissioner shall issue to the producer a certified producer’s certificate.
(B) A declaration made pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be used to infer that the producer is not required to comply with other state or federal laws relative to food safety and good agricultural practices.
(2) As part of obtaining or renewing a certified producer certificate, a producer farming fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs, and similar crops shall annually submit to the county agricultural commissioner’s office in the county in which the producer’s land or facility is located information requested by the department about the specific crops that he or she will harvest or intends to harvest for sale directly to the public. The secretary may promulgate regulations specifying the information a producer is required to submit.
(3) A certified producer’s certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner shall be valid for up to 12 months from the date of issue and may be renewed annually thereafter. The county agricultural commissioner in each county shall perform at least one onsite inspection for all new certified producer’s certificate applicants, and may perform additional inspections as needed of the property or properties listed on the certified producer’s certificate issued in his or her county as deemed appropriate by the county agricultural commissioner to verify production of the commodities being sold at a certified farmers’ market or the existence in storage of the producer’s actual harvested production, or both, of any product being sold at a certified farmers’ market. Where practical or purposeful, verification inspections shall be made when the actual harvest or sale of the commodity in question is occurring. The county agricultural commissioner shall provide to the producer a schedule of fees that reflects an estimate of expenses for certification or inspection at the time of application or renewal or before any needed additional verification inspection, and may charge a certification and inspection fee equal to the actual expenses incurred.
(d) Renewal of a certified farmers’ market certificate or certified producer’s certificate may be denied by either the department or a county agricultural commissioner if a certified farmers’ market or a producer is delinquent in the payment of the required state fee or a county certification and inspection fee or administrative civil penalty authorized pursuant to this chapter. The certificate may be eligible for renewal when all outstanding balances and associated penalties or administrative fines have been paid to the department or the respective county or counties.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law authorizes the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the prior approval of the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State Department of Health Care Services, to reproduce or distribute biological control organisms that are not detrimental to the public health and safety that are known to be useful in reducing or preventing plant or animal damage due to pests or diseases.
This bill would substitute the State Department of Public Health for the State Department of Health Care Services in these provisions.
(2) Existing law authorizes the Department of Food and Agriculture, by rule or regulation, to provide for the issuance and renewal on a 2-year basis of licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia of authority issued pursuant to the Food and Agricultural Code by the department or any agency in the department, and to set the fees for the issuance or renewal of those licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia.
This bill would instead specify that those licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia of authority issued pursuant to the Food and Agricultural Code are those issued by the department or any division, office, or other entity within the department.
(3) Existing law specifies that it is the intent of the Legislature that the department, in cooperation with appropriate county officials and industry representatives, develop mutually satisfactory sources of nonstate funding to augment budget programs in the areas of county agricultural commissioners and weights and measures.
This bill would clarify that provision to specify that it is the intent of the Legislature that the department develop mutually satisfactory sources of nonstate funding to augment budget programs in the areas of county agricultural commissioners and county sealers of weights and measures.
(4) Under existing law, certified farmers’ markets are California agricultural product point-of-sale locations that are registered and operated in accordance with specified provisions. Existing law requires an operator of a certified farmers’ market to establish a clearly defined marketing area where only agricultural products may be sold. Existing law prohibits an operator of a certified farmers’ market that also operates, manages, or otherwise controls a separate sales activity or vending event or marketing area in close proximity, adjacent, or contiguous to the operator’s certified farmers’ market from allowing the sale or distribution of fresh whole fruits, nuts, vegetables, and flowers by vendors selling within those sales activity or vending event or marketing areas. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is an infraction or misdemeanor, as specified.
This bill would add cultivated mushrooms and herbs to the list of items that an operator of a certified farmers’ market that also operates, manages, or otherwise controls a separate sales activity or vending event or marketing area in close proximity, adjacent, or contiguous to the operator’s certified farmers’ market is prohibited from selling within those sales activity or vending event or marketing areas. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires a certified farmers’ market operator or producer to annually register with the Department of Food and Agriculture by applying for and receiving a certificate from a county agricultural commissioner. Existing law requires a producer farming fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs, and similar crops, once certified, to annually submit information requested by the department about the specific crops that the producer will harvest or intends to harvest for sale directly to the public.
This bill would require a producer of these crops to submit this information to the county agricultural commissioner’s office in the county in which the producer’s land or facility is located as part of obtaining or renewing a certified producer certificate. By imposing a new duty on county agricultural commissioners, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(5) Existing law creates in the Department of Food and Agriculture the California Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Committee and provides for its continuation, and that of the California Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Program, every 4 years subject to a referendum of the citrus producers on or before June 30, 2013, and every 4 years thereafter. Pursuant to this referendum the department has extended the citrus pest and disease prevention program for an additional 4 years.
Existing law requires the committee to reimburse the Secretary of Food and Agriculture for all reasonable expenditures incurred by the secretary in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities pursuant to the citrus pest and disease prevention program, including the costs of implementing and administering the administrative, enforcement, and regulatory recommendations of the statewide work plan developed by the committee.
This bill would require the committee to reimburse the secretary for all expenditures incurred by the secretary in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities pursuant to the program.
(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Sections 405, 409, 410, 5918, 47004, and 47020 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to agriculture."

(3) If paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) applies, the owner or operator of a limousine shall further disclose to the contracting party and the passengers that the limousine does not meet the safety requirements required in subdivision (a) regarding vehicle escape options because of its exempt status, and therefore may pose a greater risk to passengers should emergency escape be necessary.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), subdivision (a) shall not apply to any limousine manufactured before 1970 that has an active transportation charter-party carrier (TCP) number that was issued by the commission as of August 15, 2013.
(2) Subdivision (a) shall apply to any limousine manufactured before 1970 if it was modified after August 15, 2013.

(b) (1) The inspection program shall include, but is not limited to, the safe operation of the vehicle, the installation of safety equipment, the retention of maintenance logs, accident reports, and records of driver discipline, compliance with federal and state motor vehicle safety standards, the examination of a preventative maintenance program, and, if ownership of the modified limousine has been transferred, the transmission of relevant safety and maintenance information of the limousine.
(2) Pursuant to the safety inspection program, the department shall conduct an inspection of each terminal of a charter-party carrier of passengers and passenger stage corporation that operates modified limousines at least once every 13 months.
(3) The department shall adopt emergency regulations for purposes of this subdivision. The adoption by the department of regulations implementing this section shall be deemed to be an emergency and necessary to avoid serious harm to the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare for purposes of Sections 11346.1 and 11349.6 of the Government Code, and the department is hereby exempted from the requirement that it describe facts showing the need for immediate action to the Office of Administrative Law. The emergency regulations shall remain in effect for no more than one year, by which time final regulations shall be adopted.
(4) (A) The department shall adopt regulations to establish an inspection fee to be collected every 13 months, based on the number of modified limousines operated by a single charter-party carrier or passenger stage corporation. The fee shall be in an amount sufficient to offset the costs to administer the inspection program and shall not be used to supplant or support any other inspection program conducted by the department. The fee shall be in addition to any other required fee. When developing the regulations, the department shall consider measures that increase efficiencies to limit the financial impact to charter-party carriers of passengers and passenger stage corporations subject to the fee. The department shall promulgate the regulations in consultation with appropriate interested parties.
(B) The fee structure established pursuant to this subdivision shall apply to modified limousines that are required to undergo a safety inspection pursuant to this section.

(b) Any purchase of advertising space or time pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be conducted pursuant to a written contract entered into by the beer manufacturer, the holder of the winegrower’s license, the distilled spirits rectifier, the distilled spirits manufacturer, or the distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent and any of the following:
(1) The on-sale licensee.
(2) With respect to clause (ii) of subparagraph (N) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), the major tenant of the outdoor stadium.

42.
(a) Where a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount levied or collected by the tax agency has been determined to have been illegally levied or collected in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, any person who paid that tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount may file with the tax agency a claim for refund of the amount so paid in accordance with this section and the tax agency shall refund the amount so paid.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a person who has paid to the tax agency a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount described in subdivision (a) that filed a claim for refund prior to the effective date of the act adding this section that the tax agency has not refunded before that date shall be refunded by the tax agency to the person in accordance with the provisions of this section. The act adding this section shall not be construed to require refiling of those previously filed claims for refund.
(c) Notwithstanding any other law relating to the limitations period for filing a claim for refund, this section shall apply to any claims for refund of any amounts described in subdivision (a) paid to the tax agency.
(d) A claim for refund for any amounts described in subdivision (a) shall be filed within one year after the date upon which the court decision described in subdivision (a) becomes final and nonappealable.
(e) Interest shall be paid on the refunds provided by this section in accordance with applicable provisions of this code related to the tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount subject to refund.
(f) For the purposes of bringing an action against the tax agency for recovery of the whole or any part of the amount claimed as an overpayment of an amount described in subdivision (a), the period for filing such action provided in this code and applicable to the tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount, shall not commence until the one-year claim period provided in subdivision (d) has expired pursuant to the terms of this section. Suits for refund shall be brought in accordance with the applicable provisions in this code.
(g) When information in the tax agencies’ records is sufficient to identify the person that paid an amount described in subdivision (a), and the person’s current address, the date of payment, and the amount paid, the tax agency shall refund that amount. The person shall not be required to file a claim for refund.
(h) Except as provided in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 7275) of Part 1.6, this section shall apply to the tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount paid to the tax agency and collected or levied pursuant to applicable provisions of this code.

Section 5148 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
5148.
Notwithstanding Section 5140, an action to recover taxes levied on state-assessed property arising out of a dispute as to an assessment made pursuant to Section 721, including a dispute as to valuation, assessment ratio, or allocation of value for assessment purposes, shall be brought under this section. In any action brought under this section, the following requirements shall apply:
(a) The action shall be brought by the state assessee. There shall be a single complaint with all parties joined therein with respect to disputes for any year.
(b) The action shall name the board and the county or counties. When a county is named which collected taxes on behalf of a city or cities, the county shall give notice of that action to the city or cities within 30 days of receipt of advice from the board of the action. A fee shall be payable by the state assessee in an amount prescribed by the court to cover the reasonable costs incurred by a county or counties in giving that notice. Any city receiving notice of the action filed against the board and the county may, within 30 days of the receipt of that notice, intervene in that action. Whether or not a city intervenes in the action, any judgment rendered for an assessee shall be entered exclusively against the county; however, the county shall be entitled to recover separately from the city or cities and other tax entities those taxes collected by the county on behalf of the city or cities and other tax entities which are subject to refund to the assessee as the result of the judgment. Payment to the taxpayer upon the judgment and any interest thereon may be deferred by the county until the apportionment of property tax revenue next following the date of the judgment, or as the county and the taxpayer may otherwise agree. Interest shall accrue during any deferral period unless the county and taxpayer otherwise agree. The county may if it chooses to do so offset the amount of the judgment and interest recoverable by it from the city or cities and other tax entities against amounts held in the county treasury therefor or against amounts due and payable thereto, including, but not limited to, property tax apportionments. The amount of the fee required by this section shall not be recoverable by the assessee in the action and no judgment entered in the action in favor of the assessee shall provide for the recovery of the fee.
As used in this section, “county” includes a city and county.
(c) Service of the summons and complaint shall be only upon the board. The board shall serve as agent of the defendant county or counties for the purpose of service of process. A fee shall be payable by the state assessee in an amount prescribed by the court to cover all reasonable costs incurred by the board while acting in its capacity as agent for the defendant counties.
(d) Venue of the action shall be in any county in which the Attorney General of California has an office or in which the state assessee has a significant presence.
(e) The action shall be limited in the case of valuation and allocation disputes to the grounds specified in the following:
(1) A petition for reassessment filed under Section 741, or any proceeding thereon.
(2) A petition for correction of allocated assessment filed under Section 747, or any proceeding thereon.
(f) A timely filed petition for reassessment or petition for correction of allocated assessment shall constitute a claim for refund if the petitioner states in the petition it is intended to so serve.
(g)
The
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (j), the
action shall be commenced only after payment of the taxes in issue and within four years after the latest of the dates that the State Board of Equalization mailed its decision or its written findings and conclusions on the following:
(1) A petition for reassessment filed under Section 741 and intended to constitute a claim for refund.
(2) A petition for correction of allocated assessment filed under Section 747 and intended to constitute a claim for refund.
(h) The action shall not be joined with any action filed under Section 5140.
(i) Any refund of tax overpayments and any interest thereon, determined in any action brought under this section to be due shall be made by the defendant county or counties.
(j) Where the tax assessed or allocated has been determined to have been illegally assessed or allocated in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the action shall commence no later than one year from the date the court rendered that decision.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that the refunds allowed to persons by this act with respect to taxes, fees, assessments, surcharges, or other amounts levied or collected by the Franchise Tax Board or the State Board of Equalization, as applicable, that have been determined to be illegally levied or collected in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, serves a public purpose and does not constitute a gift of public funds within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.","(1) The Franchise Tax Board administers the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law and the State Board of Equalization administers the Sales and Use Tax Law and various other tax and fee laws. Counties, cities, and districts, as specified, are authorized to impose local sales or transactions and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local laws. Those laws generally require a claim for refund to be filed within specified timeframes based on the date of overpayment or specified board action if any amount has been overpaid, as specified. Under those laws, the rule of res judicata, which provides that a matter that has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be pursued further by the same parties is applicable only if the liability involved is for the same reporting period as was involved in the case previously determined.
This bill would, notwithstanding existing law regarding the rule of res judicata, where a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount levied or collected by the tax agency, which this bill would define to include the board and the Franchise Tax Board, has been determined to have been illegally levied or collected in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, authorize any person who paid that tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount to file with the tax agency a claim for refund, within one year after the date of the final and nonappealable decision and would require the tax agency to refund the amount so paid. This bill would also require the tax agency to refund these amounts without the person filing a claim for refund when information in the tax agencies’ records is sufficient to identify the person. This bill would, upon appropriation by the Legislature, allocate the amounts necessary to make these refunds to the applicable tax agency.
(2) Existing law requires an action to recover property taxes levied on state-assessed property arising out of a dispute as to an assessment to be commenced only after payment of the taxes in issue and within 4 years after the latest of the dates that the State Board of Equalization mailed its decision or its written findings and conclusions, as provided.
This bill would instead require, where the tax assessed or allocated has been determined to have been illegally assessed or allocated in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the action to commence no later than one year from the date the court rendered that decision.
(3) This bill would make a legislative finding and declaration regarding the public purpose served by the bill.","An act to amend Section 5148 of, and to add Section 42 to, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

(b) The agreement shall contain provisions the board finds necessary to protect the interests of this system, including provisions for determination of the amount, time, and manner of transfer of cash or securities, or both, to be transferred to the county system representing the actuarial value of the interests in the retirement fund of the public agency or the state and the transferred employees by reason of accumulated contributions credited to that public agency or the state and the employees transferred. The agreement may also contain any other provisions that the board deems necessary to address issues related to the transfer, including, but not limited to, benefits subject to an outstanding domestic relations order and benefits subject to a lien. The agreement shall apply only to employees who are employed by the county or district on the effective date of the agreement.
(c) All liability of this system with respect to the members transferred under that agreement shall cease and shall become the liability of the county retirement system as of the date of transfer specified in the agreement. Liability of the county retirement system shall be for payment of benefits to transferred employees in accordance with Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3.
(d) Any member transferred who becomes a member of a county retirement system upon that transfer date shall be subject to provisions of this part and of Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3 extending rights to a member or subjecting him or her to limitations because of membership in another retirement system to the same extent that he or she would have been had he or she been a member of the county retirement system during his or her membership in this system.

That member of the county retirement system shall be entitled to service credit in the county retirement system for the service for which he or she was entitled to credit in the Public Employees’ Retirement System at the time of cessation of employment by the public agency or the state, without necessity of payment of any additional contributions in respect to that service, when and if all of the following occur:
(a) The board of retirement receives certification from the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of the service with which the person was entitled to be credited by the Public Employees’ Retirement System at the time of cessation of his or her public agency or state employment.
(b) There is paid into the county retirement fund of the county, an amount equal to the normal contributions of the person to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, together with all interest credited thereto, which amount shall be credited to the individual account of the member in the county retirement system, and shall thereafter for all purposes be deemed to be the member’s contribution to the county retirement system with respect to the service so certified.
(c) There is paid to the retirement system of the county an amount equal to all contributions of the public agency or the state made to the Public Employees’ Retirement System on account of service rendered by the person together with interest credited to the public agency or the state thereto.
(d) The board of retirement elects to apply this section as a prudent means of mitigating against potential adverse financial impact upon the county retirement system from the cost of disability retirements that may be applied for in the future by persons injured while being employed by the county, fire authority, or district after ceasing to be employed by a public agency or the state as a result of the assumption by a county, fire authority, or district of firefighting or law enforcement functions.
This section shall apply in a county of the first, the second, the seventh, or the fourteenth class, as defined by Section 28020, as amended by Chapter 1204 of the Statutes of 1971, and Section 28022, as amended by Chapter 43 of the Statutes of 1961, and Sections 28023, 28028, and 28035, as amended by Chapter 1204 of the Statutes of 1971.","Existing law authorizes public agencies to contract with the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to have their employees become members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS). Existing law, with respect to the Counties of Kern, Los Angeles, and Orange, permits the board to enter into an agreement with the contracting agency’s board of retirement for termination of the contracting agency’s participation in PERS and inclusion of the agency’s employees in the retirement system of the city or county, if specified requirements are met, with respect to certain safety members, including firefighters. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 establishes a corresponding authority for accepting these people as members for retirement systems created pursuant to its provisions, and granting them service credit for their service credited by PERS.

(a) The Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340), Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 11370), Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400), and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500)) requires agencies and the Office of Administrative Law to review regulations to ensure their consistency with law and to consider impacts on the state’s economy and businesses, including small businesses.
(b) However, the act does not require agencies to individually review their regulations to identify overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations that may exist.
(c) At a time when the state’s economy is slowly recovering, unemployment and underemployment continue to affect all Californians, especially older workers and younger workers who received college degrees in the last seven years but are still awaiting their first great job, and with state government improving but in need of continued fiscal discipline, it is important that state agencies systematically undertake to identify, publicly review, and eliminate overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations, both to ensure they more efficiently implement and enforce laws and to reduce unnecessary and outdated rules and regulations.
Article  2. Definitions
11366.1.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “State agency” means a state agency, as defined in Section 11000, except those state agencies or activities described in Section 11340.9.

Article  3. State Agency Duties

(b) Identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date.
(c) Adopt, amend, or repeal regulations to reconcile or eliminate any duplication, overlap, inconsistencies, or out-of-date provisions, and shall comply with the process specified in Article 5 (commencing with Section 11346) of Chapter 3.5, unless the addition, revision, or deletion is without regulatory effect and may be done pursuant to Section 100 of Title 1 of the California Code of Regulations.
(d) Hold at least one noticed public hearing, which shall be noticed on the Internet Web site of the state agency, for the purposes of accepting public comment on proposed revisions to its regulations.

An agency listed in Section 12800 shall notify a state agency of any existing regulations adopted by that agency that may duplicate, overlap, or be inconsistent with the state agency’s regulations.
11366.45.
This chapter shall not be construed to weaken or undermine in any manner any human health, public or worker rights, public welfare, environmental, or other protection established under statute. This chapter shall not be construed to affect the authority or requirement for an agency to adopt regulations as provided by statute. Rather, it is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that state agencies focus more efficiently and directly on their duties as prescribed by law so as to use scarce public dollars more efficiently to implement the law, while achieving equal or improved economic and public benefits.
Article  4. Chapter Repeal
11366.5.
This chapter shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order for state agencies to timely complete a full review of regulations by the 2019 deadline, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.
SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a)In 2013, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported that California has nearly 40,000 chronically homeless persons, which is 36 percent of the total chronically homeless population of the United States. This is due in large part to an insufficient amount of affordable housing in California.
(b)HUD also reported that there are over 15,000 homeless veterans in California.
(c)Several studies, including one by the Journal of the American Medical Association, have demonstrated that it is far more cost effective and efficient to provide the homeless with permanent, supportive housing through “rapid rehousing” and “housing first” initiatives. These measures also reduce the cost to governments of funding shelters and emergency services.

Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 15290) is added to Part 6.6 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the
Government Code
, to read:

Rapid Rehousing Enhancement Program
15290.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)“Department” means the Department of Housing and Community Development.
(b)“Homeless” has the same meaning as defined in Section 576.2 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(c)“Enhancement program” means the program established pursuant to this chapter for distributing funds to counties and private nonprofit organizations.
(d)“Private nonprofit organization” has the same meaning as defined in Section 11371 of Title 42 of the United States Code.
15290.5.
(a)Upon appropriation of funds in the annual Budget Act, the department shall establish an enhancement program for awarding grants to counties and private nonprofit organizations that operate a rapid rehousing program. The department shall administer the enhancement program.
(b)The department shall develop guidelines to select four counties or private nonprofit organizations to participate in the enhancement program. Eligible counties and private nonprofit organizations shall include counties and private nonprofit organizations eligible to receive funds from the state pursuant to the federal Emergency Solutions Grants Program (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11371 et seq.) with a demonstrated high funding need. The department shall select counties and private nonprofit organizations by giving priority to those counties or private nonprofit organizations with existing rapid rehousing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in providing rapid rehousing for individuals and veterans of the United States military experiencing homelessness.
(c)Counties and private nonprofit organizations selected to receive funds pursuant to this section shall comply with the reporting requirements as required by the department under state and federal regulations implementing the Emergency Solutions Grants Program (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11371 et seq.).
(d)The department shall distribute an equal amount of the money received pursuant to this section each year, less any amount deducted for administrative purposes, to each of the selected counties and private nonprofit organizations.
(e)The department may use up to 5 percent of the money received pursuant to this section for the purpose of administering this chapter.
15291.
This chapter shall remain in effect only until July 1, 2018, and as of that date is repealed.","Existing law authorizes various state entities to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations for various specified purposes. The Administrative Procedure Act requires the Office of Administrative Law and a state agency proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation to review the proposed changes for, among other things, consistency with existing state regulations.
This bill, until January 1, 2020, would require each state agency to, on or before January 1, 2019, review that agency’s regulations, identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date, revise those identified regulations, as provided, and report to the Legislature and Governor, as specified.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
Existing federal law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allocated, until September 30, 2011, $1.5 billion to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Homelessness Prevention Fund, to be used for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing. Existing federal law, known as the Emergency Solutions Grants Program, provides grants to states, local governments, and private nonprofit organizations, as specified, for specified housing assistance activities. Existing law, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Act, provides housing supports to individuals if the administering county determines that the individual or his or her family is experiencing homelessness or housing instability that would be a barrier to self-sufficiency or child well-being and declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that housing supports utilize evidence-based models, including those established in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program.
This bill would require the Department of Housing and Community Development to establish, upon appropriation of funds in the annual Budget Act, an enhancement program for awarding grants to counties and private nonprofit organizations that operate a rapid rehousing program. The bill would require the department to develop guidelines to select 4 counties and private nonprofit organizations to receive these grant funds and require that eligible counties and private nonprofit organizations include those that are eligible to receive funds from the state pursuant to the Emergency Solutions Grants Program with a demonstrated high funding need. The bill would require the department to give priority to counties with existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in providing rapid rehousing for homeless individuals and veterans. This bill would require the department to distribute this money equally to each of the selected counties and private nonprofit organizations, less an amount of up to 5% deducted for administrative purposes. The bill would repeal these provisions as of July 1, 2018.","An act to add and repeal Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 15290) of Part 6.6 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to housing.

This act shall become operative only if Senate Bill 778 of the 2015–16 Regular Session, relating to professions and vocations, is enacted and becomes effective on or before January 1, 2017.","Existing law, the Automotive Repair Act, the violation of which is a crime, establishes the Bureau of Automotive Repair under the supervision and control of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Existing law regulates the business of automotive repair and makes it unlawful for any person to be an automotive repair dealer unless registered with the bureau. Existing law defines an automotive repair dealer and an automotive technician as persons who, among other things, repair motor vehicles.
Existing law defines the “repair of motor vehicles” to mean all maintenance of, and repairs to, motor vehicles, except repairing tires, changing tires, lubricating vehicles, installing light bulbs, batteries, windshield wiper blades, and other minor services.
Existing law defines “automotive technician” as a dealer, or a person employed by a dealer, who performs maintenance, diagnostics, repair, removal or installation of specified integral automotive components, but excluding minor services, as set forth above.
This bill would require the director to adopt regulations prior to January 1, 2018, defining “minor services” for these purposes.
This bill would, until January 1, 2018, include installation of propulsive batteries in the definition of “repair of motor vehicles.”
This bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would recast the definition of “repair of motor vehicles” to delete the listing of the various types of excluded minor services and to specify that minor services do not include the changing of propulsive batteries, and also would exclude roadside services, as defined. The bill would similarly recast the definition of “automotive technician” to delete these references and to delete provisions describing the specific work to be performed by an automotive technician. The bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would include the services performed by an operator of a tow truck owned or operated by a person or entity enrolled in the Basic Inspection of Terminals program, as specified, in the definition of “roadside services.”
This bill would provide that the regulations adopted by the director, prior to January 1, 2018, defining “minor services” continue in effect on and after January 1, 2018.
Because the failure of a person installing propulsive batteries to register as a repair dealer or technician with the bureau would constitute a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

Electronic Ballot Transmission
3050.
(a)An elections official may send a voter a ballot by secure electronic transmission if the election is conducted wholly within the county.","Existing law requires that a vote by mail ballot be available to any registered voter and specifies the manner by which the ballot must be returned. Existing law permits a military or overseas voter who is temporarily living outside of the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia, or is called to military service, to return his or her vote by mail ballot by facsimile transmission to the elections official. The ballot must be received by the closing of the election day polls and accompanied by an identification envelope and an oath of voter declaration in a prescribed form. Existing law requires a military or overseas voter who returns a ballot by facsimile transmission to agree in an oath of voter declaration under penalty of perjury to waive his or her right to a secret ballot and that he or she has not applied for a vote by mail ballot from any other jurisdiction for the election. The elections official is required to determine the voter’s eligibility to vote by comparing the voter’s signature from the materials returned by facsimile transmission to the signature on the voter’s affidavit of registration.
This bill would permit a military or overseas voter to return his or her ballot by electronic mail, as prescribed. The bill would require the ballot to be accompanied by a copy of an identification envelope and an oath of voter declaration in substantially the form described with respect to facsimile transmission of ballots. This bill would require the elections official to determine the voter’s eligibility to vote by comparing the signature on the scanned copy of the identification envelope with the signature on the voter’s affidavit of registration.
This bill would permit a military or overseas voter to cast his or her vote on the Internet by electronically marking his or her ballot and securely transmitting the voted ballot to the appropriate elections official. To be counted, the voted ballot must be received by the voter’s elections official no later than the closing of the polls on election day. These provisions would become operative only if the Secretary of State certifies that he or she has identified and addressed all issues regarding the security of casting a vote using the Internet.
Because the bill requires elections officials to provide a higher level of service and expands the scope of the crime of perjury, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Existing law requires that a vote by mail ballot be available to any registered voter. Under existing law, a voter may: (1) return the vote by mail ballot by mail or in person to the elections official from whom it came; (2) return the vote by mail ballot in person to a member of a precinct board at a polling place within the jurisdiction, or (3), if unable to return the vote by mail ballot, designate his or her spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, or a person residing in the same household as the vote by mail voter to return the ballot to the elections official from whom it came or to the precinct board at a polling place within the jurisdiction.
This bill would authorize an elections official to send a voter a ballot by secure electronic transmission for an election conducted wholly within the county. This bill would also require a voter who receives a ballot in this manner to print the ballot for return to the elections official.","An act to

CHAPTER  5.9. Plastic Microbeads Nuisance Prevention Law
42360.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Plastic does not biodegrade into elements or compounds commonly found in nature like other organic materials, but, instead, upon exposure to the elements photodegrades into smaller pieces of plastic causing land and water pollution that is virtually impossible to remediate.
(b) Plastic pollution is the dominant type of anthropogenic debris found throughout the marine environment.
(c) Plastic pollution is an environmental and human health hazard and a public nuisance.
(d) Microplastics that are five millimeters or less in diameter become bioavailable as soon as they enter the marine environment and are ingested by marine organisms.
(e) Microplastics are persistent organic compounds that attract other pollutants commonly present in the environment, many of which are recognized to have serious deleterious impacts on human health or the environment, including DDT, DDE, PCBs, and flame retardants.
(f) PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs from plastic transfer to fish tissue when ingested and bioaccumulate.
(g) Fish that humans consume have been found to ingest microplastics, which are then ingested by the humans who consume these fish.
(h) Consumer personal care products such as facial scrubs, soaps, and toothpaste increasingly contain thousands of microplastics in the form of plastic microbeads that are flushed down drains or make their way into the environment by other means as part of their intended use.
(i) Plastic microbeads in personal care products are generally not recoverable through ordinary wastewater treatment and can be released into the environment.
(j) Plastic microbeads have been found in surface waters within the United States, as well as in fish, marine mammals, reptiles, mussels, and worms.
(k) There are economically feasible alternatives to plastic microbeads used in personal care products, as evidenced by the current use of biodegradable, natural, abrasive materials in personal care products such as beeswax, shells, nuts, seeds, and sand.
42361.
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Person” means an individual, business, or other entity.
(b) (1) “Personal care product” means an article intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced to, or otherwise applied to, the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and an article intended for use as a component of that type of article.

(c) “Plastic microbead” means an intentionally added solid plastic particle measuring five millimeters or less in every dimension.
42362.
On and after January 1, 2020, a person shall not sell or offer for promotional purposes in this state any personal care products containing plastic microbeads that are used to exfoliate or cleanse in a rinse-off product, including, but not limited to, toothpaste.
42363.
Section 42362 shall not apply to a person that sells or offers for promotional purposes a personal care product containing plastic microbeads in an amount less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight.
42364.
(a) A person who violates or threatens to violate Section 42362 may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) (1) A person who has violated Section 42362 is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day for each violation in addition to any other penalty established by law. That civil penalty may be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) In assessing the amount of a civil penalty for a violation of this chapter, the court shall consider all of the following:
(A) The nature and extent of the violation.
(B) The number of, and severity of, the violations.
(C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator.
(D) Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and when these measures were taken.
(E) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole.
(F) Any other factor that justice may require.
(c) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the people of the state, by a district attorney, by a city attorney, or by a city prosecutor in a city or city and county having a full-time city prosecutor.
(d) Civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the office of the city attorney, city prosecutor, district attorney, or Attorney General, whichever office brought the action.
42366.
This chapter does not alter or diminish any legal obligation otherwise required in common law or by statute or regulation, and this chapter does not create or enlarge any defense in any action to enforce the legal obligation. Penalties and sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to any penalties or sanctions otherwise prescribed by law.","The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65) prohibits any person, in the course of doing business, from knowingly and intentionally exposing any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without giving a specified warning, or from discharging or releasing such a chemical into any source of drinking water, except as specified. Existing law prohibits the sale of expanded polystyrene packaging material by a wholesaler or manufacturer. Existing law prohibits a person from selling a plastic product in this state that is labeled with the term “compostable,” “home compostable,” or “marine degradable” unless, at the time of sale, the plastic product meets the applicable ASTM International standard specification.
This bill would prohibit, on and after January 1, 2020, a person, as defined, from selling or offering for promotional purposes in this state a personal care product containing plastic microbeads that are used to exfoliate or cleanse in a rinse-off product, as specified. The bill would exempt from those prohibitions the sale or promotional offer of a product containing less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight of plastic microbeads.
The bill would make a violator liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation. The bill would authorize the penalty to be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Attorney General or local officials. The bill would require the civil penalties collected in an action brought pursuant to the act to be retained by the office that brought the action.","An act to add Chapter 5.9 (commencing with Section 42360) to Part 3 of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, relating to waste management."

(6) Participation in a summer youth job program has been proven to increase the high school graduation rate of children in low-income homes.
(b) Based on the findings and declarations in subdivision (a), it is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would support school participation and high school attainment among low-income youth.

(a)The department shall, in coordination with the State Department of Education, identify a method and utilize that method to track the high school completion rates of children in an assistance unit. The department shall report to the Legislature no later than July 1, 2016, if a change in statute is required in order to track high school completion rates of children in an assistance unit.
(b)The department shall make publicly available an aggregate report of the high school completion rates tracked by the department pursuant to subdivision (a).
11341.
To incentivize completion of high school or the equivalent for recipients of aid 19 years of age and under, those recipients shall, upon verification that the recipient has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent, receive a two-hundred-dollar ($200) supplement to the amount of aid paid pursuant to Section 11450. The supplement shall be paid directly to the recipient and shall be disregarded as income in determining the income of the assistance unit and the income of the CalFresh household if the recipient is receiving CalFresh. Cal-Learn participants who are already eligible for a similar incentive under Article 3.5 (commencing with Section 11331) are not eligible for the supplement established in this subdivision.
11342.
To support educational outcomes and physical fitness of children in an assistance unit, a child in an assistance unit shall receive, in advance, a transportation service supplement to the amount of aid paid pursuant to Section 11450, as determined by the department, to pay for transportation services in order for the child to participate in an After School Education and Safety Program (ASES) established pursuant to Section 8482 of the Education Code.
11343.
To support educational outcomes of children in an assistance unit, the department shall coordinate with county human services agencies and the State Department of Health Care Services to annually inform assistance units of the need to have a child’s vision regularly examined and how to schedule an appointment with an optometrist for children receiving Medi-Cal benefits.
11344.
(a)The department shall, in consultation with county human services agencies, programs created under the federal Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act, State Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) offices, and local CSBG entities, design a youth subsidized employment program for youth 15 to 19 years of age, inclusive, who are eligible for benefits under this chapter and needy youth, as defined in subdivision (b). The program shall provide paid employment, occupational skills training, and other relevant services. The payment for employment and services provided under this section shall be subject to the same financial participation as payment under subdivision (a) of Section 11450.
(b)For the purposes of this section, “needy youth” mean individuals 18 to 24 years of age, inclusive, whose family income, which may include the youth living alone, is less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
(c)All employers and caseworkers involved in this program shall be trained in trauma-informed care and restorative justice practices.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1)The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, enacted by initiative statute, establishes the After School Education and Safety Program to serve pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 9, inclusive, at participating public elementary, middle, junior high, and charter schools. The act gives priority enrollment in both after school and before school programs to pupils in middle school or junior high school who attend daily.
This bill would instead give first priority enrollment to homeless youth, as defined, 2nd priority enrollment to pupils in CalWORKs assistance units, as described, and 3rd priority enrollment, for programs serving middle and junior high school pupils, to pupils who attend the program daily.
The act provides that an after school and before school program is not required to charge family fees or conduct individual eligibility determination based on need or income.
This bill would prohibit a program that charges family fees from charging a fee to a family with a homeless youth or a family who is part of a CalWORKs assistance unit.
(2)Existing
Existing
law authorizes the governing board of a school district to provide for the transportation of pupils to and from school whenever in the judgment of the board the transportation is advisable and good reasons exist to do so.
This bill would require a pupil entitled to free or reduced-price meals, or who attends a school that participates in the Community Eligibility Option, to be entitled to free transportation to and from school provided by the local educational agency, if certain conditions are met. The bill would require the local educational agency to designate a liaison to implement a plan, in consultation with specified stakeholders, to ensure that all entitled pupils receive free transportation in a timely manner.
By requiring new duties on a local educational agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients.
This bill would require that a $200 supplement to the amount of cash aid provided under the program be paid to a CalWORKs recipient 19 years of age and under, upon verification that the recipient has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent.
The bill would also, among other things, require the State Department of Social Services, in coordination with the State Department of Education, to identify a method and to use that method to track the high school completion rates of children in an assistance unit, and to make publicly available an aggregate report of these high school completion rates tracked by the department.
The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to, in consultation with specified entities, design a youth subsidized employment program for youth 15 to 19 years of age, inclusive, who are eligible for benefits under this bill and needy youth, as defined, and would require the program to provide paid employment, occupational skills training, and other relevant services.
The bill would require a child in an assistance unit to receive, in advance, a transportation service supplement to the amount of cash aid provided under the program to pay for transportation services in order for the child to participate in an After School Education and Safety Program (ASES).
By increasing county administrative duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would authorize the State Department of Social Services to implement the above provisions by all-county letters or similar instructions until regulations are adopted and would require the department to adopt regulations on or before January 1, 2018.
(4)Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
(5)The
The
California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to

(A) The brand, and class or type, of beer.
(B) The true and correct name and address of the manufacturer of the beer. For purposes of this provision, if multiple beer manufacturers are involved in the production of the beer pursuant to a joint venture or other collaborative arrangement, each of those manufacturers may be identified on the label.
(C) The true and correct name of the bottler of the beer, if other than the manufacturer.
(D) A statement of alcoholic content if the beer contains more than 5.7 percent alcohol by volume.
(2) For purposes of this subdivision, the true and correct name of a manufacturer, bottler, or packager shall be deemed to include a fictitious business name for which the manufacturer, bottler, or packager has duly filed a fictitious business name statement pursuant to Section 17900.
(c) Prior to the first sale of a brand of beer in this state, the manufacturer of that beer shall register the brand with the department. Upon the filing of the registration with the department, the brand may be sold in this state without further action by the department. The registration shall include the following:
(1) The true name and address of the actual manufacturer of the beer.
(2) Any fictitious business name of the manufacturer under which the beer is manufactured.
(3) The class or type of beer and all brand names under which the beer is to be sold in this state.

(b) A beer manufacturer that refills any container supplied by a consumer shall affix a label that complies with this section on the container prior to its resale to the consumer. Any information concerning any beer previously packaged in the container, including, but not limited to, information regarding the manufacturer and bottler of the beer, or any associated brands or trademarks, shall be removed or completely obscured in a manner not readily removable by the consumer prior to the resale of the container to the consumer. This subdivision does not authorize a beer manufacturer to refill a container supplied by a consumer with a capacity of five liquid gallons or more.
SEC. 4.
Section 25204 of the Business and Professions Code is repealed.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act imposes various requirements relating to the labels and containers of alcoholic beverages sold within the state, including a requirement that every manufacturer or bottler of beer whose beer is sold within the state file with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control the brand name or names under which the beer is sold or labeled, as provided. The act provides that a violation of its provisions is a misdemeanor if not otherwise specified.
This bill would require a manufacturer, before the first sale of a brand of beer in this state, to register the brand with the department, as specified, and would make the manufacturer responsible for compliance with labeling and registration requirements. The bill, if beer is sold or offered for sale in this state without first complying with these provisions or other provisions of the act, would authorize the department to take action it deems reasonable and necessary including, but not limited to, ordering that the beer not be sold, or allowing it to be sold for a reasonable time, until these requirements are met.
This bill, by expanding the scope of an existing crime, would impose a state-mandated local program.

SEC. 6.
(a) With regard to Section 5 of this act, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) On June 3, 2014, California’s Fourth District Court of Appeal, in Disenhouse v. Peevey (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1096, held that an interested person desiring to enforce the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) against the Public Utilities Commission must do so by filing a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court or the court of appeal and may not do so by filing an action for injunctive relief in the superior court.
(2) Also in 2014, the Public Utilities Commission argued in the Superior Court of San Francisco that Section 1759 of the Public Utilities Code prevents the superior court from ordering the commission to provide the City of San Bruno, pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), with emails documenting improper communications between commissioners and utility executives.
(3) The Public Utilities Commission continues to maintain the position that the superior court does not have jurisdiction to hear actions arising out of the California Public Records Act, and has cited the Disenhouse case defending this position.
(4) The intent of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act is that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.
(5) The intent of the California Public Records Act is to protect the fundamental right of every person in this state to access information concerning the conduct of the people’s business.
(6) The people’s right to remain informed so that they may retain control over the instruments of government that they have created is not less of a right for some agencies than for other agencies, nor shall the people’s ability to enforce the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the California Public Records Act be more hampered for some agencies than for other agencies.
(7) The duties, responsibilities, and actions of the Public Utilities Commission affect the well-being of current and future generations, and the public interest and principles of fundamental fairness and due process of law require that the commission conduct its affairs in an open, objective, and impartial manner, free of undue influence and the abuse of power and authority.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Public Utilities Commission should be subject to the judicial review provisions of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the California Public Records Act.
SEC. 7.
Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this act do not apply to any claims brought by an electrical corporation, as defined in Section 218 of the Public Utilities Code, that arise from the energy crisis of 2000–02.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. When the commission orders rate refunds to be distributed, existing law requires the commission to require the public utility to pay refunds to all current utility customers, and, when practicable, to prior customers, on an equitable pro rata basis without regard as to whether or not the customer is classifiable as a residential or commercial tenant, landlord, homeowner, business, industrial, educational, governmental, nonprofit, agricultural, or any other type of entity.
Existing law establishes the Ratepayer Relief Fund in the State Treasury to benefit electricity and natural gas ratepayers and to fund investigation and litigation costs of the state in pursuing allegations of overcharges and unfair business practices against generators, suppliers, or marketers of electricity or natural gas arising from the energy crisis of 2000–02. Existing law requires that any energy settlement agreement, as defined, entered into by the Attorney General, after reimbursing the Attorney General’s litigation and investigation expenses, direct settlement funds to the following purposes in priority order: (1) to reduce ratepayer costs of those utility ratepayers harmed by the actions of the settling parties; and (2) for deposit in the Ratepayer Relief Fund. Existing law authorizes the moneys deposited in the Ratepayer Relief Fund to be appropriated for certain purposes for the benefit of ratepayers.
This bill would require the Attorney General or the Public Utilities Commission to enter into an energy settlement agreement solely on a monetary basis and would prohibit the agreement from including nonmonetary compensation in lieu of monetary compensation. The bill would prohibit the commission from distributing or expending the proceeds of claims in any litigation or settlement to obtain ratepayer recovery for the effects of the 2000–02 energy crisis and would require that the proceeds, after reimbursing the commission’s litigation and investigation expenses, be deposited into the Ratepayer Relief Fund. The bill would require the moneys in the fund to be appropriated for those purposes for the benefit of ratepayers.
The California Constitution provides that the Legislature has plenary power to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record. Existing law provides that only the Supreme Court and the court of appeal have jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, restrain, or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties.
This bill would authorize an action to enforce the requirements of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act or the California Public Records Act to be brought against the commission in the superior court.","An act to amend Sections 16428.3 and 16428.5 of, and to add Section 16428.25 to, the Government Code, and to amend Sections 453.5 and 1759 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to public utilities."
659,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) California law grants the superior courts jurisdiction to make judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of children within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, including the juvenile, probate, and family court divisions of the superior court. These courts are empowered to make the findings necessary for a child to petition the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for classification as a special immigrant juvenile under federal law.
(2) Special immigrant juvenile status, under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, offers interim relief from deportation to undocumented immigrant children under 21 years of age, if a state juvenile court has made specific findings.
(3) The findings necessary for a child to petition for classification as a special immigrant juvenile include, among others, a finding that reunification with one or both parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law, and a finding that it is not in the child’s best interest to be returned to his or her country of origin.
(4) Despite recent changes to law that eliminate ambiguity regarding the jurisdiction of superior courts to make the findings necessary to petition for special immigrant juvenile status, misalignment between state and federal law continues to exist.
(5) Federal law allows a person under 21 years of age, who otherwise meets the requirements for special immigrant juvenile status, to file for relief as a special immigrant juvenile. In California, however, individuals who are between 18 and 21 years of age have largely been unable to obtain the findings from the superior court necessary to seek special immigrant juvenile status and the relief that it was intended to afford them, solely because probate courts cannot take jurisdiction of individuals 18 years of age or older by establishing a guardianship of the person. This is true despite the fact that many unaccompanied immigrant youth between 18 and 21 years of age face circumstances identical to those faced by their younger counterparts.
(6) Given the recent influx of unaccompanied immigrant children arriving to the United States, many of whom have been released to family members and other adults in California and have experienced parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment, it is necessary to provide an avenue for these unaccompanied children to petition the probate courts to have a guardian of the person appointed beyond reaching 18 years of age. This is particularly necessary in light of the vulnerability of this class of unaccompanied youth, and their need for a custodial relationship with a responsible adult as they adjust to a new cultural context, language, and education system, and recover from the trauma of abuse, neglect, or abandonment. These custodial arrangements promote permanency and the long-term well-being of immigrant children present in the United States who have experienced abuse, neglect, or abandonment.
(7) Guardianships of the person may be necessary and convenient for these individuals between 18 and 21 years of age, although a youth for whom a guardian has been appointed retains the rights that an adult may have under California law.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to give the probate court jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for a person between 18 and 21 years of age in connection with a special immigrant juvenile status petition. It is further the intent of the Legislature to provide an avenue for a person between 18 and 21 years of age to have a guardian of the person appointed beyond 18 years of age in conjunction with a request for the findings necessary to enable the person to petition the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for classification as a special immigrant juvenile.

Section 1490 of the Probate Code is amended to read:
1490.
Except as set forth in Section 1510.1, when used in any statute of this state with reference to an adult or to the person of a married minor, “guardian” means the conservator of that adult or the conservator of the person in case of the married minor.
SEC. 3.
Section 1510.1 is added to the Probate Code, to read:
1510.1.
(a) (1) With the consent of the proposed ward, the court may appoint a guardian of the person for an unmarried individual who is 18 years of age or older, but who has not yet attained 21 years of age in connection with a petition to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 155 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(2) A petition for guardianship of the person of a proposed ward who is 18 years of age or older, but who has not yet attained 21 years of age may be filed by a relative or any other person on behalf of the proposed ward, or the proposed ward.
(b) (1) At the request of, or with the consent of, the ward, the court may extend an existing guardianship of the person for a ward past 18 years of age, for purposes of allowing the ward to complete the application process with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for classification as a special immigrant juvenile pursuant to Section 1101(a)(27)(J) of Title 8 of the United States Code.
(2) A relative or any other person on behalf of a ward, or the ward, may file a petition to extend the guardianship of the person for a period of time not to extend beyond the ward reaching 21 years of age.
(c) This section does not authorize the guardian to abrogate any of the rights that a person who has attained 18 years of age may have as an adult under state law, including, but not limited to, decisions regarding the ward’s medical treatment, education, or residence, without the ward’s express consent.
(d) For purposes of this division, the terms “child,” “minor,” and “ward” include an unmarried individual who is younger than 21 years of age and who, pursuant to this section, consents to the appointment of a guardian or extension of a guardianship after he or she attains 18 years of age.
(e) The Judicial Council shall, by July 1, 2016, adopt any rules and forms needed to implement this section.
SEC. 4.
Section 1600 of the Probate Code is amended to read:
1600.
(a) A guardianship of the person or estate or both terminates when the ward attains majority unless, pursuant to Section 1510.1, the ward requests the extension of, or consents to the extension of, the guardianship of the person until the ward attains 21 years of age.
(b) A guardianship of the person terminates upon the death of the ward, the adoption of the ward, or upon the emancipation of the ward under Section 7002 of the Family Code.
SEC. 5.
Section 1601 of the Probate Code is amended to read:
1601.
Upon petition of the guardian, a parent, the minor ward, or, in the case of an Indian child custody proceeding, an Indian custodian or the ward’s tribe, the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is in the ward’s best interest to terminate the guardianship. Upon petition of a ward who is 18 years of age or older, the court shall make an order terminating the guardianship. Notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given for the period and in the manner provided in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 1460) of Part 1.","Existing federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act, establishes a procedure for classification of certain aliens as special immigrants who have been declared dependent on a juvenile court, and authorizes those aliens to apply for an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident within the United States. Under federal regulations, an alien is eligible for special immigrant juvenile status if he or she is under 21 years of age. Existing state law provides that the juvenile, probate, and family divisions of the superior court have jurisdiction to make judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of juveniles within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. Existing law also requires the court, upon request, to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status if there is evidence to support those findings, as specified.
Existing law also establishes the jurisdiction of the probate court. Existing law regulates the establishment and termination of guardianships in probate court, and specifies that a guardian has the care, custody, and control of a ward.
Existing law provides that a relative or other person on behalf of a minor, or a minor if he or she is 12 years of age or older, may file a petition for the appointment of a guardian of the person or estate of the minor. Existing law also provides that a guardianship of the person or estate terminates when the ward attains majority or dies, or is adopted or emancipated, as specified.
This bill would authorize a court to appoint a guardian of the person of an unmarried individual who is 18 years of age or older, but who has not yet attained 21 years of age in connection with a petition to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status, as specified, if the proposed ward consents. This bill would also authorize a court to extend a guardianship of the person of a ward beyond 18 years of age, as specified, if the ward so requests or consents. The bill would also provide that a guardianship of the person terminates after the ward attains majority unless the ward consents to, or requests the extension of, the guardianship of the person until he or she is 21 years of age, as specified.","An act to amend Sections 1490, 1600, and 1601 of, and to add Section 1510.1 to, the Probate Code, relating to juveniles."

SEe state or outside of the state.
(2) Exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost shall submit periodic information to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred.
(3) The information in the reports submitted pursuant to this subdivision may be provided to the department on an aggregated facility-wide basis and may exclude financial data, such as contract terms and conditions (including information on pricing, credit terms, volume discounts and other proprietary business terms), the jurisdiction of the origin of the materials, or information on the entities from which the materials are received. The department may provide this information to jurisdictions, aggregated by company, upon request. The aggregated information, other than that aggregated by company, is public information.
(c) The department shall adopt regulations pursuant to this section requiring practices and procedures that are reasonable and necessary to implement this section, and that provide a representative accounting of solid wastes and recyclable materials that are handled, processed, or disposed. Those regulations approved by the department shall not impose an unreasonable burden on waste and recycling handling, processing, or disposal operations or otherwise interfere with the safe handling, processing, and disposal of solid waste and recyclables. The department shall include in those regulations both of the following:
(1) Procedures to ensure that an opportunity to comply is provided prior to initiation of enforcement authorized by Section 41821.7.
(2) Factors to be considered in determining penalty amounts that are similar to those provided in Section 45016.

(e) Any person who knowingly or willfully files a false report, or any person who refuses to permit the department or any of its representatives to make inspection or examination of records, or who fails to keep any records for the inspection of the department, or who alters, cancels, or obliterates entries in the records for the purpose of falsifying the records as required by regulations adopted pursuant to this section, is liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) and not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation of a separate provision or, for continuing violations, for each day that the violation continues.
(f) Liability under this section may be imposed in a civil action, or liability may be imposed administratively pursuant to this article.
(g) (1) Notwithstanding Title 5 (commencing with Section 3426) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code and Article 11 (commencing with Section 1060) of Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code, all records that the facility or operator is reasonably required to keep to allow the department to verify information in, or verification of, the reports required pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) and implementing regulations shall be subject to inspection and copying by the department, but shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).
(2) Notwithstanding Title 5 (commencing with Section 3426) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code and Article 11 (commencing with Section 1060) of Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code, an employee of a government entity may, at the disposal facility, inspect and copy records related to tonnage received at the facility on or after July 1, 2015, and originating within the government entity’s geographic jurisdiction. Those records shall be limited to weight tags that identify the hauler, vehicle, quantity, date, type, and origin of waste received at a disposal facility. Those records shall be available to those government entities for the purposes of subdivision (a) and as necessary to enforce the collection of local fees, but those records shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code). Names of haulers using specific landfills shall not be disclosed by a government entity unless necessary as part of an administrative or judicial enforcement proceeding to fund local programs or enforce local franchises.
(3) A government entity may petition the superior court for injunctive or declaratory relief to enforce its authority under paragraph (2). The times for responsive pleadings and hearings in these proceedings shall be set by the judge of the court with the object of securing a decision as to these matters at the earliest possible time.
(4) For purposes of this section, a government entity is an entity identified in Section 40145 or an entity formed pursuant to Section 40976.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “disposal” and “disposal facility” have the same meanings as prescribed by Sections 40120.1 and 40121, respectively.
(6) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit or expand the authority of a government entity that may have been provided by this section and implementing regulations as they read on December 31, 2015.
(7) The records subject to inspection and copying by the department pursuant to paragraph (1) or by an employee of a government entity pursuant to paragraph (2) may be redacted by the operator before inspection to exclude confidential pricing information contained in the records, such as contract terms and conditions (including information on pricing, credit terms, volume discounts, and other proprietary business terms), if the redacted information is not information that is otherwise required to be reported to the department.
(h) Notwithstanding the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Title 2.5 (commencing with Section 1633.1) of Part 2 of Division 3 of the Civil Code), reports required by this section shall be submitted electronically, using an electronic reporting format system established by the department.
(i) All records provided in accordance with this section shall be subject to Section 40062.","The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, generally regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of solid waste. Existing law requires disposal facility operators to submit information to counties from periodic tracking surveys on the disposal tonnages that are disposed of at the disposal facility by jurisdiction or region of origin. Existing law requires solid waste handlers and transfer station operators to provide information to the disposal facility on the origin of the solid waste they deliver to the disposal facility. Existing law requires recycling and composting facilities to submit periodic information to counties on the types and quantities of materials that are disposed of, sold to end users, or sold to exporters or transporters for sale outside of the state, by county of origin. Existing law requires counties to submit periodic reports to the cities within the county, to any regional agency of which the county is a member, and to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery on the amounts of solid waste disposed of by jurisdiction or region of origin, and on the categories and amounts of solid waste diverted to recycling and composting facilities within the county or region. Existing law authorizes the department to adopt regulations in this regard.
This bill would revise these provisions by, among other things, (1) requiring recycling and composting operations and facilities to submit specified information directly to the department, rather than to counties, (2) requiring disposal facility operators to submit tonnage information to the department, and to counties only on request, and (3) deleting the requirement for counties to submit that information to cities, regional agencies, and the department. The bill would delete references to periodic tracking surveys. The bill would require exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost to submit periodic information to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred inside or outside of the state, and would authorize the department to provide this information, on an aggregated basis, to jurisdictions, as specified. The bill would make the aggregated information, other than that aggregated by company, public information. The bill would make other related changes to the various reporting requirements. The bill would provide for imposition of civil penalties on any person who refuses or fails to submit information required by the governing regulations, and on any person who knowingly or willfully files a false report, refuses to permit the department to inspect or examine associated records, or alters, cancels, or obliterates entries in the records, as specified. The bill would provide that the civil penalties may be imposed either in a civil action or administratively pursuant to procedures specified in the bill. The bill would specify the types of waste disposal records that are subject to inspection and copying by the department, and also by an employee of a government entity, as defined, with respect to tonnage received at a disposal facility on or after July 1, 2015, that originates within the government entity’s geographic jurisdiction. The bill, with respect to those records, would prohibit a government entity from disclosing the name of a waste hauler using a specific landfill unless necessary as part of an administrative or judicial proceeding, as specified. The bill would also authorize a government entity to petition the superior court for injunctive or declaratory relief to enforce these provisions. The bill would require recovered civil penalties to be deposited in the Integrated Waste Management Account.
The California Public Records Act provides that public records are open to inspection at all times during the office hours of the state or local agency that retains those records, and that every person has a right to inspect any public record, but exempts certain records from those requirements. Existing law, upon the request of any person furnishing any report, notice, application, plan, or other document required by the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, provides that neither the department nor an enforcement agency shall make available for inspection by the public any portion of the report, notice, application, plan, or other document that contains a trade secret, as specified.
This bill would exempt certain waste disposal records subject to inspection and copying by the department or a government entity from disclosure under certain California Public Records Act provisions. The bill would also make certain waste disposal records subject to nondisclosure under the trade secrets provisions.","An act to amend Section 41821.5 of, to amend, renumber, and add Section 41821.6 of, and to add Sections 41821.7 and 41821.8 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste."

(c) Pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, this section is repealed on January 1, 2021.","Existing unemployment compensation disability law provides a formula for determining benefits available to qualifying disabled individuals. For an individual who has quarterly base wages of greater than $1,749.20, the weekly benefit is calculated by multiplying base wages by 55% and dividing the result by 13. For a benefit that is not a multiple of $1, existing law provides that the benefit shall be computed to the next higher multiple of $1. However, existing law provides that this amount may not exceed the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount.
Under existing law, the family temporary disability insurance program provides up to 6 weeks of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for specified persons, or to bond with a minor child within one year of the birth or placement of the child in connection with foster care or adoption. Existing law defines “weekly benefit amount” for purposes of this program to mean the amount of benefits available to qualifying disabled individuals pursuant to unemployment compensation disability law.
This bill would revise the formula for determining benefits available pursuant to unemployment compensation disability law and for the family temporary disability insurance program, for periods of disability commencing after January 1, 2018, but before January 1, 2022, to provide a weekly benefit amount minimum of $50 and increase the wage replacement rate to specified percentages, but not to exceed the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to existing law.
Existing law deems an individual to be eligible for family temporary disability benefits if, among other things, the individual is unable to perform his or her regular or customary work for a 7-day waiting period during each disability benefit period. and prohibits payments for benefits during this waiting period.
This bill, on and after January 1, 2018, also would remove the 7-day waiting period for these benefits.
This bill, by authorizing an increase in the expenditure of money from the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, would make an appropriation.
This bill would require, by July 1, 2017, the Employment Development Department to report to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and Senate Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations specified information regarding the waiting period for disability benefits.

Notwithstanding any other law, only an employer, qualified manager, or his or her designated agent may certify experience for purposes of this section. For purposes of this section, the term “employer” shall mean only those persons, corporations, partnerships, proprietorships, or other associations which, in the employ of the designated individual, regularly and routinely withheld income taxes and other payroll deductions for direct forwarding to governmental taxing authorities. For the purposes of this section, the term “qualified manager” shall mean only a manager who has qualified pursuant to Section 7536 and who has directly overseen the work and experience of the applicant.
An employer who is a licensee or qualified manager shall respond in writing within 30 days to an applicant’s written request for certifications of the applicant’s work experience as an employee and either provide the certifications or the reasons for denial.

The act authorizes the director to deny, suspend, or revoke a license if the director determines, among other things, that any provision of the act was violated by the licensee. The act also authorizes the director to impose a civil penalty of no greater than $500 instead of suspending or revoking a license issued under the act for the violation of specified provisions if the director determines that the imposition of the civil penalty better serves the purposes of the act. The act requires an application for a license to be verified and include certain information, including, but not limited to, the full name and business address of the applicant.
This bill would require the Governor to appoint a Private Investigator Disciplinary Review Committee, and would authorize the Governor to remove any member of the committee for misconduct, incompetency, or neglect of duty. The bill would require the committee to consist of 3 members actively engaged in the business of a licensed private investigator and 2 public members and would require members to be appointed for a term of 4 years. The bill would require the committee to meet every 60 days or more or less frequently as may be required, and would require that the members be paid per diem and be reimbursed for actual travel expenses. The bill would require the committee to perform certain functions, including affirming, rescinding, or modifying decisions concerning administrative fines or the denial, suspension, or revocation of licenses that are appealed to the committee, as specified. The bill would authorize the committee to grant a probationary license with respect to appealed decisions, as specified. The bill would authorize a person licensed under the act to appeal the assessment of an administrative fine to the committee, and would authorize a person denied, suspended of, or revoked of a license to appeal to the committee, except as specified, if the appeal is in writing and made within 30 days of the assessment of the fine or denial, suspension, or revocation of the license. The bill would require the committee to notify the appellant in writing, by regular mail, of the committee’s decision within 30 days of that decision. The bill would also authorize the appellant to request a hearing, as specified, if, among other things, the appellant disagrees with the committee’s decision regarding the appeal. The bill would require that all evidence used by the bureau be provided to the committee prior to hearing an appeal. The bill would make the above provisions operative on July 1, 2017.
This bill would also authorize an applicant to, at his or her discretion, include a valid email address on the application.
Existing law requires an applicant, or his or her manager, for a license as a private investigator to have had at least 3 years’ experience in investigation work. Existing law requires an applicant to substantiate the claimed years of qualifying experience and the exact details as to the character and nature thereof by written certifications from the employer, subject to independent verification by the Director of Consumer Affairs as he or she may determine. Under existing law, the business of each licensee is required to be operated under the active direction, control, charge, or management, in this state, of the licensee, if he or she is qualified, or the person who is qualified to act as the licensee’s manager, if the licensee is not qualified. Existing law prohibits a person from acting as a qualified manager of a licensee until he or she has complied with certain requirements.
This bill would additionally authorize that written certification to be from a qualified manager, as specified.
Existing law requires experience for purposes of taking the examination for licensure as a private investigator to be limited to those activities actually performed in connection with investigations, as defined, and only if those activities are performed by persons who are employed in certain specified capacities.
This bill would additionally authorize such activities to be performed by persons who are managed, as specified, in those capacities.","An act to amend Sections 7525.1, 7541, and 7541.1 of, and to add Sections 7519.1, 7519.2, 7519.3, and 7519.4 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to private investigators."

(h) The aiding or abetting of any person to violate this chapter or any regulations duly adopted under this chapter.
(i) The aiding or abetting of any person to engage in the unlawful practice of respiratory care.
(j) The commission of any fraudulent, dishonest, or corrupt act that is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a respiratory care practitioner.
(k) Falsifying, or making grossly incorrect, grossly inconsistent, or unintelligible entries in any patient, hospital, or other record.
(l) Changing the prescription of a physician and surgeon, or falsifying verbal or written orders for treatment or a diagnostic regime received, whether or not that action resulted in actual patient harm.
(m) Denial, suspension, or revocation of any license to practice by another agency, state, or territory of the United States for any act or omission that would constitute grounds for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license in this state.
(n) (1) Except for good cause, the knowing failure to protect patients by failing to follow infection control guidelines of the board, thereby risking transmission of bloodborne infectious diseases from licensee to patient, from patient to patient, and from patient to licensee. In administering this subdivision, the board shall consider referencing the standards, regulations, and guidelines of the State Department of Public Health developed pursuant to Section 1250.11 of the Health and Safety Code and the standards, regulations, and guidelines pursuant to the California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 (Part 1 (commencing with Section 6300) of Division 5 of the Labor Code) for preventing the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and other bloodborne pathogens in health care settings. As necessary, the board shall consult with the California Medical Board, the Board of Podiatric Medicine, the Dental Board of California, the Board of Registered Nursing, and the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians, to encourage appropriate consistency in the implementation of this subdivision.
(2) The board shall seek to ensure that licensees are informed of the responsibility of licensees and others to follow infection control guidelines, and of the most recent scientifically recognized safeguards for minimizing the risk of transmission of bloodborne infectious diseases.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Under the Respiratory Care Practice Act, the Respiratory Care Board of California licenses and regulates the practice of respiratory care and therapy. The act authorizes the board to order the denial, suspension, or revocation of, or the imposition of probationary conditions upon, a license issued under the act, for any of specified causes. A violation of the act is a crime.
This bill would include among those causes for discipline the employment of an unlicensed person who presents herself or himself as a licensed respiratory care practitioner when the employer should have known the person was not licensed. The bill would also include among those causes for discipline the provision of false statements or information on any form provided by the board or to any person representing the board during an investigation, probation monitoring compliance check, or any other enforcement-related action when the individual knew or should have known the statements or information was false.
The bill would provide that the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, or suspension of a license, practice privilege, or other authority to practice respiratory care, the placement of a license on a retired status, or the voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee, does not deprive the board of jurisdiction to commence or proceed with any investigation of, or action or disciplinary proceeding against, the licensee, or to render a decision to suspend or revoke the license.
(2) Under the act the board may take action against a respiratory care practitioner who is charged with unprofessional conduct which includes, but is not limited to, repeated acts of clearly administering directly or indirectly inappropriate or unsafe respiratory care procedures, protocols, therapeutic regimens, or diagnostic testing or monitoring techniques, and violation of any provision for which the board may order the denial, suspension, or revocation of, or the imposition of probationary conditions upon, a license. The act provides that engaging in repeated acts of unprofessional conduct is a crime.
This bill would expand the definition of unprofessional conduct to include any act of abuse towards a patient and any act of administering unsafe respiratory care procedures, protocols, therapeutic regimens, or diagnostic testing or monitoring techniques. Because this bill would change the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 3750 and 3755 of, and to add Section 3754.8 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to healing arts."

(d) If an individual designates a contribution to more than one account or fund listed on the tax return, and the amount available is insufficient to satisfy the total amount designated, the contribution shall be allocated among the designees on a pro rata basis.
(e) The Franchise Tax Board shall revise the form of the return to include a space labeled “State Children’s Trust Fund for the Prevention of Child Abuse” to allow for the designation permitted under subdivision (a). The form shall also include in the instructions information that the contribution may be in the amount of one dollar ($1) or more and that the contribution shall be used to support child abuse prevention programs with demonstrated success, public education efforts to change adult behaviors and educate parents, innovative research to identify best practices, and the replication of those practices to prevent child abuse and neglect.

(c) The remainder to the State Department of Social Services for innovative child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs operated by private nonprofit organizations or public institutions of higher education with recognized expertise in fields related to child welfare and for evaluation, research, or dissemination of information concerning existing program models for the purpose of replication of successful models as specified in Article 5 (commencing with Section 18965) of Chapter 11 of Part 6 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
18704.
It is the intent of the Legislature that this article creates an additional source of funding for a specified purpose. The funds generated by this article shall not be used in place of funds from other sources that are available to the State Children’s Trust Fund.
18705.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), this article shall remain in effect only until January 1 of the fifth taxable year following the first appearance of the State Children’s Trust Fund on the personal income tax return, and is repealed as of December 1 of that year.
(b) (1) By September 1 of the second calendar year and each subsequent calendar year that the State Children’s Trust Fund appears on the tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall do all of the following:
(A) Determine the minimum contribution amount required to be received during the next calendar year for the fund to appear on the tax return for the taxable year that includes that next calendar year.
(B) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article is inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year, and shall be repealed on December 1 of that calendar year.
(3) For purposes of this section, the minimum contribution amount for a calendar year means two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the second calendar year after the first appearance of the State Children’s Trust Fund on the personal income tax return or the minimum contribution amount as adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c).
(c) For each calendar year, beginning with the third calendar year after the first appearance of the State Children’s Trust Fund on the personal income tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall adjust, on or before September 1 of that calendar year, the minimum contribution amount specified in subdivision (b) as follows:
(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.

SEC. 2.
Section 18969 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
18969.
(a) There is hereby created in the State Treasury a fund which shall be known as the State Children’s Trust Fund. The fund shall consist of funds received from a county pursuant to Section 18968, funds collected by the state and transferred to the fund pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 103625 of the Health and Safety Code and Article 1 (commencing with Section 18701) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, grants, gifts, or bequests made to the state from private sources to be used for innovative and distinctive child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention projects, and money appropriated to the fund for this purpose by the Legislature. The State Registrar may retain a percentage of the fees collected pursuant to Section 103625 of the Health and Safety Code, not to exceed 10 percent, in order to defray the costs of collection.
(b) Money in the State Children’s Trust Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for the purpose of funding child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs. The department may not supplant any federal, state, or county funds with any funds made available through the State Children’s Trust Fund.
(c) The department may establish positions as needed for the purpose of implementing and administering child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs that are funded by the State Children’s Trust Fund. However, the department shall use no more than 5 percent of the funds appropriated pursuant to this section, exclusive of the funds transferred to the State Children’s Trust Fund pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 18701) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, for administrative costs. Administrative costs do not include the moneys allocated to the department to pursue public education about child abuse and neglect prevention and early intervention as described in subdivision (b) of Section 18703 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(d) No State Children’s Trust Fund money shall be used to supplant state General Fund money for any purpose.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Children’s Trust Fund provide for all of the following:
(1) The development of a public-private partnership by encouraging consistent outreach to the private foundation and corporate community.
(2) Funds for large-scale dissemination of information that will promote public awareness regarding the nature and incidence of child abuse and the availability of services for intervention. These public awareness activities shall include, but not be limited to, the production of public service announcements, well-designed posters, pamphlets, booklets, videos, and other media tools.
(3) Research and demonstration projects that explore the nature and incidence and the development of long-term solutions to the problem of child abuse.
(4) The development of a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness through activities that will promote the charitable tax deduction for the trust fund and seek continued contributions. These activities may include convening a philanthropic roundtable, developing literature for use by the State Bar of California for dissemination, and whatever other activities are deemed necessary and appropriate to promote the trust fund.","Existing law allows individual taxpayers to contribute amounts in excess of their personal tax liability for the support of specified funds or accounts and previously allowed contributions to the State Children’s Trust Fund, which provides funding for child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, would allow individual taxpayers to contribute amounts in excess of their tax liability to the State Children’s Trust Fund. The bill would prohibit a voluntary contribution designation for this fund from being added on the form of the tax return until another designation is removed or space is available, whichever occurs first.
This bill would require moneys in the State Children’s Trust Fund from the voluntary contributions, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of costs, as provided, and the balance to the State Department of Social Services for specified uses related to the prevention of child abuse and neglect, as provided.
This bill would provide that these voluntary contribution provisions are inoperative and repealed on the earlier of the following: inoperative on January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the first appearance of the fund on the tax return and repealed on December 1 of that year or inoperative for taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of a specified calendar year in which the Franchise Tax Board estimates by September 1 that the contributions made on returns filed in that calendar year will be less than $250,000, or an adjusted amount for subsequent taxable years, and repealed on December 1 of that calendar year.","An act to add and repeal Article 1 (commencing with Section 18701) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and to amend Section 18969 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to taxation."

SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or a district attorney to make a written application to a judge of a superior court for an order permitting the interception of wire communication and electronic communication, as defined. Existing law permits an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. Existing law conditions the granting of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the oral approval is made. Existing law prohibits a communication interception from lasting for longer than 30 days. Existing law permits an extension of the original order, not to exceed 30 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension.
This bill would prohibit a person, other than a provider of electronic or wire communication service for specified purposes, from installing or using a pen register or a trap and trace device, as defined. The bill would authorize a peace officer to make a written application to a magistrate for an order permitting the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device. The bill would require the magistrate to enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device only in specified circumstances and would permit the magistrate to question the peace officer pertaining to the need for the information. The bill would also permit an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. The bill would condition the grant of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the pen register or trap and trace device is installed. The bill would prohibit the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device for longer than 60 days. The bill would permit an extension of the original order, not to exceed 60 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension. The bill would clarify that any location information obtained by a pen register or a track and trace device is limited to the information that can be determined from the telephone number.
The bill would make the prohibited installation or use of a pen register or a trap and trace device punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 1 year, or by imprisonment in state prison for offenders with specified prior convictions, or by both that fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Sections 638.50, 638.51, 638.52, and 638.53 to the Penal Code, relating to privacy."

The restricted driving privilege granted under this subdivision may be conditioned on participation in the 24/7 Sobriety program as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a person subject to this subdivision shall participate in the 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year.
(d) For purposes of this section, a “24/7 Sobriety program” requires a participant to abstain from alcohol or controlled substance use for a designated period of time and be subject to breath testing for alcohol or controlled substances at least twice per day at a testing location as the primary testing methodology, or by continuous transdermal monitoring device, or by an alternative method approved by NHTSA in the event of a hardship. Program violations shall be met with immediate but modest sanctions.

(f) Testing locations and methods that provide the best ability to sanction a violation as close in time as reasonably feasible to the occurrence of the violation should be given preference.
(g) In order to enable all required defendants to participate, each person shall pay the program costs commensurate with the person’s ability to pay as determined pursuant to Section 11837.4 of the Health and Safety Code.
(h) The court shall not impose a program of more than 180 days in length unless the defendant tests positive for alcohol or an unauthorized controlled substance or fails to appear for a test.

All abstracts of accident reports shall be available to law enforcement agencies and courts of competent jurisdiction.
(b)The department shall make available or disclose abstracts of convictions and abstracts of accident reports required to be sent to the department in Sacramento, as described in subdivision (a), if the date of the occurrence is not later than the following:
(1)Ten years for a violation pursuant to Section 23140, 23152, or 23153.
(2)Seven years for a violation designated as two points pursuant to Section 12810, except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
(3)Three years for accidents and all other violations.
(c)The department shall make available or disclose suspensions and revocations of the driving privilege while the suspension or revocation is in effect and for three years following termination of the action or reinstatement of the privilege, except that driver’s license suspension actions taken pursuant to Sections 13202.6 and 13202.7, Section 17520 of the Family Code, or Section 256 of, or former Section 11350.6 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be disclosed only during the actual time period in which the suspension is in effect.
(d)The department shall not make available or disclose a suspension or revocation that has been judicially set aside or stayed.
(e)The department shall not make available or disclose personal information about a person unless the disclosure is in compliance with the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2721 et seq.). However, a disclosure is subject to the prohibition in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 12800.5.
(f)The department shall make available or disclose to the courts and law enforcement agencies a conviction of Section 23103, as specified in Section 23103.5, or a conviction of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153, or Section 655 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, or paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 192 of the Penal Code for a period of 10 years from the date of the offense for the purpose of imposing penalties mandated by this code, or by other applicable state law.
(g)The department shall make available or disclose to the courts and law enforcement agencies a conviction of Section 191.5, or subdivision (a) of Section 192.5 of the Penal Code, punished as a felony, for the purpose of imposing penalties mandated by Section 23550.5, or by other applicable state law.
(h)(1)Consent to the use of a person’s driver’s license number by the insurance agent or broker of an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer to obtain, transmit, or otherwise utilize the motor vehicle records of that person pursuant to this section shall be presumed if the person provides his or her driver’s license number, or the driver’s license number of any dependent, to an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer for the purpose of eligibility, underwriting, and rating of personal or commercial insurance coverage or eligibility for employment or continued employment involving the use of a motor vehicle.
(2)(A)The insurance agent or broker of the insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer is authorized to transmit motor vehicle records for the purposes described in paragraph (1). An insurance agent or broker who has lawfully transmitted a record as authorized by this section is not responsible for the subsequent handling of that record by any recipient who is authorized to receive a record under this section.
(B)Prior to transmitting records pursuant to this paragraph to any insurer with whom the insurance broker or agent does not have a written agreement, or to a third party authorized by this paragraph to receive those records, the broker or agent shall obtain a written agreement from the insurer or other third party that the insurer or other third party shall handle those records in accordance with state and federal laws governing fair credit reporting and privacy.","Existing law prohibits a person who has 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle. Existing law also prohibits a person while having 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle and concurrently doing any act forbidden by law, or neglecting any duty imposed by law in driving the vehicle, when the act or neglect proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver. A violation of either of these prohibitions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a court, in addition to imposing penalties and sanctions for those violations, to require the person to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a driving-under-the-influence program, which may include, among other things, education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to immediately suspend a person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a specified period of time if the person has driven a motor vehicle when the person had a certain blood-alcohol concentration. Existing law also requires the department to suspend or revoke the driving privilege of a person who refuses an officer’s request or fails to complete a chemical test or tests, as specified. Existing law authorizes certain individuals whose privilege is suspended or revoked pursuant to that provision to receive a restricted driver’s license if specified requirements are met, including the completion of specified periods of license suspension or revocation and, in some instances, the installation of an ignition interlock device on the person’s vehicle.
This bill would authorize the court to order a person convicted of a crime described above to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified “24/7 Sobriety program,” as defined, as a condition of probation, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the crime within 10 years of one or more separate crimes described above that resulted in a conviction. The bill also would authorize a court to order participation in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond for a person who has been charged with a crime described above. The bill would permit a person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked for certain violations, and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege, to be permitted to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program. The bill would define a “24/7 Sobriety program,” in part, as requiring a person in the program to abstain from alcohol and unauthorized controlled substances and be subject to frequent testing for alcohol and controlled substances, as specified. The bill would require a person participating in the program to pay the program costs, commensurate with the person’s ability to pay, as specified.
Existing law provides that all records of the Department of Motor Vehicles relating to the registration of vehicles, other information contained on an application for a driver’s license, abstracts of convictions, and certain abstracts of accident reports are required to be open to public inspection during office hours, except when a specific provision of law prohibits the disclosure of records or information or provides for confidentiality.
This bill would provide that consent to the use of a person’s driver’s license number by the insurance agent or broker of an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer to obtain, transmit, or otherwise utilize the motor vehicle records of that person pursuant to the provision described above is presumed if the person provides his or her driver’s license number to an insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer for the purpose of eligibility, underwriting, and rating of personal or commercial insurance coverage or eligibility for employment or continued employment involving the use of a motor vehicle. The bill would provide that the insurance agent or broker of the insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer is authorized to transmit motor vehicle records for these purposes, as specified, and would specify that an insurance agent or broker who has lawfully transmitted a record as authorized under these provisions is not responsible for the subsequent handling of that record by any recipient who is authorized to receive the record under these provisions.

Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 10722.4 of the Water Code proposed by both this bill and Senate Bill 13. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, (2) each bill amends Section 10722.4 of the Water Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 13, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.","Existing law requires the Department of Water Resources to identify the extent of monitoring of groundwater elevations that is being undertaken within each groundwater basin or subbasin and to prioritize basins or subbasins as high, medium, low, or very low priority, and requires the initial priority for each basin to be established no later than January 31, 2015. Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the department that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified. The act requires a local agency, any time the department changes these basin priorities and elevates a basin to a medium- or high-priority basin after January 31, 2015, to either establish a groundwater sustainability agency within 2 years of reprioritization and adopt a groundwater sustainability plan within 5 years of reprioritization, or to submit an alternative to the department that the local agency believes satisfies the objectives of these provisions within 2 years of reprioritization.
This bill would impose the requirement to establish a groundwater sustainability agency or submit an alternative after reprioritization on a local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin.
The act authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to impose fees to fund the costs of a groundwater sustainability program and requires a groundwater sustainability agency to hold at least one public meeting prior to imposing or increasing a fee. The act requires, at least 10 days prior to the meeting, a groundwater sustainability agency to make available to the public data upon which the proposed fee is based.
This bill would require a groundwater sustainability agency to make the data upon which the proposed fee is based available 20 days prior to the public meeting to impose or increase a fee.
This bill would incorporate changes to Section 10722.4 of the Water Code proposed by both this bill and SB 13, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.","An act to amend Sections 10722.4 and 10730 of the Water Code, relating to groundwater."

SECTION 1.
Section 2851 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
2851.
(a) In implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall do all of the following:
(1) (A) The commission shall authorize the award of monetary incentives for up to the first megawatt of alternating current generated by solar energy systems that meet the eligibility criteria established by the Energy Commission pursuant to Chapter 8.8 (commencing with Section 25780) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code. The commission shall determine the eligibility of a solar energy system, as defined in Section 25781 of the Public Resources Code, to receive monetary incentives until the time the Energy Commission establishes eligibility criteria pursuant to Section 25782. Monetary incentives shall not be awarded for solar energy systems that do not meet the eligibility criteria. The incentive level authorized by the commission shall decline each year following implementation of the California Solar Initiative, at a rate of no less than an average of 7 percent per year, and, except as provided in subparagraph (B), shall be zero as of December 31, 2016. The commission shall adopt and publish a schedule of declining incentive levels no less than 30 days in advance of the first decline in incentive levels. The commission may develop incentives based upon the
output of electricity from
electricity generated by
the system, provided those incentives are consistent with the declining incentive levels of this paragraph and the incentives apply to only the first megawatt of electricity generated by the system.
(B) The incentive level for the installation of a solar energy system pursuant to Section 2852 shall be zero as of December 31, 2021.
(2) The commission shall adopt a performance-based incentive program so that by January 1, 2008, 100 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 100 kilowatts or greater and at least 50 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 30 kilowatts or greater are earned based on the actual electrical output of the solar energy systems. The commission shall encourage, and may require, performance-based incentives for solar energy systems of less than 30 kilowatts. Performance-based incentives shall decline at a rate of no less than an average of 7 percent per year. In developing the performance-based incentives, the commission may:
(A) Apply performance-based incentives only to customer classes designated by the commission.
(B) Design the performance-based incentives so that customers may receive a higher level of incentives than under incentives based on installed electrical capacity.
(C) Develop financing options that help offset the installation costs of the solar energy system, provided that this financing is ultimately repaid in full by the consumer or through the application of the performance-based rebates.
(3) By January 1, 2008, the commission, in consultation with the Energy Commission, shall require reasonable and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings as a condition of providing incentives for eligible solar energy systems, with appropriate exemptions or limitations to accommodate the limited financial resources of low-income residential housing.
(4) Notwithstanding subdivision (g) of Section 2827, the commission may develop a time-variant tariff that creates the maximum incentive for ratepayers to install solar energy systems so that the system’s peak electricity production coincides with California’s peak electricity demands and that ensures that ratepayers receive due value for their contribution to the purchase of solar energy systems and customers with solar energy systems continue to have an incentive to use electricity efficiently. In developing the time-variant tariff, the commission may exclude customers participating in the tariff from the rate cap for residential customers for existing baseline quantities or usage by those customers of up to 130 percent of existing baseline quantities, as required by Section 739.9. Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the commission to require time-variant pricing for ratepayers without a solar energy system.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), in implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission may authorize the award of monetary incentives for solar thermal and solar water heating devices, in a total amount up to one hundred million eight hundred thousand dollars ($100,800,000).
(c) (1) In implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall not allocate more than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) to research, development, and demonstration that explores solar technologies and other distributed generation technologies that employ or could employ solar energy for generation or storage of electricity or to offset natural gas usage. Any program that allocates additional moneys to research, development, and demonstration shall be developed in collaboration with the Energy Commission to ensure there is no duplication of efforts, and adopted by the commission through a rulemaking or other appropriate public proceeding. Any grant awarded by the commission for research, development, and demonstration shall be approved by the full commission at a public meeting. This subdivision does not prohibit the commission from continuing to allocate moneys to research, development, and demonstration pursuant to the self-generation incentive program for distributed generation resources originally established pursuant to Chapter 329 of the Statutes of 2000, as modified pursuant to Section 379.6.
(2) The Legislature finds and declares that a program that provides a stable source of monetary incentives for eligible solar energy systems will encourage private investment sufficient to make solar technologies cost effective.
(3) On or before June 30, 2009, and by June 30th of every year thereafter, the commission shall submit to the Legislature an assessment of the success of the California Solar Initiative program. That assessment shall include the number of residential and commercial sites that have installed solar thermal devices for which an award was made pursuant to subdivision (b) and the dollar value of the award, the number of residential and commercial sites that have installed solar energy systems, the electrical generating capacity of the installed solar energy systems, the cost of the program, total electrical system benefits, including the effect on electrical service rates, environmental benefits, how the program affects the operation and reliability of the electrical grid, how the program has affected peak demand for electricity, the progress made toward reaching the goals of the program, whether the program is on schedule to meet the program goals, and recommendations for improving the program to meet its goals. If the commission allocates additional moneys to research, development, and demonstration that explores solar technologies and other distributed generation technologies pursuant to paragraph (1), the commission shall include in the assessment submitted to the Legislature, a description of the program, a summary of each award made or project funded pursuant to the program, including the intended purposes to be achieved by the particular award or project, and the results of each award or project.
(d) (1) The commission shall not impose any charge upon the consumption of natural gas, or upon natural gas ratepayers, to fund the California Solar Initiative.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any charge imposed to fund the program adopted and implemented pursuant to this section shall be imposed upon all customers not participating in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) or family electric rate assistance (FERA) programs, including those residential customers subject to the rate limitation specified in Section 739.9 for existing baseline quantities or usage up to 130 percent of existing baseline quantities of electricity.
(3) The costs of the program adopted and implemented pursuant to this section shall not be recovered from customers participating in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or CARE program established pursuant to Section 739.1, except to the extent that program costs are recovered out of the nonbypassable system benefits charge authorized pursuant to Section 399.8.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), in implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall ensure that the total cost over the duration of the program does not exceed three billion five hundred fifty million eight hundred thousand dollars ($3,550,800,000). Except as provided in subdivision (f), financial components of the California Solar Initiative shall consist of the following:
(1) Programs under the supervision of the commission funded by charges collected from customers of San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Except as provided in subdivision (f), the total cost over the duration of these programs shall not exceed two billion three hundred sixty-six million eight hundred thousand dollars ($2,366,800,000) and includes moneys collected directly into a tracking account for support of the California Solar Initiative.
(2) Programs adopted, implemented, and financed in the amount of seven hundred eighty-four million dollars ($784,000,000), by charges collected by local publicly owned electric utilities pursuant to Section 2854. Nothing in this subdivision shall give the commission power and jurisdiction with respect to a local publicly owned electric utility or its customers.
(3) Programs for the installation of solar energy systems on new construction (New Solar Homes Partnership Program), administered by the Energy Commission, and funded by charges in the amount of four hundred million dollars ($400,000,000), collected from customers of San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. If the commission is notified by the Energy Commission that funding available pursuant to Section 25751 of the Public Resources Code for the New Solar Homes Partnership Program and any other funding for the purposes of this paragraph have been exhausted, the commission may require an electrical corporation to continue administration of the program pursuant to the guidelines established for the program by the Energy Commission, until the funding limit authorized by this paragraph has been reached. The commission, in consultation with the Energy Commission, shall supervise the administration of the continuation of the New Solar Homes Partnership Program by an electrical corporation. An electrical corporation may elect to have a third party, including the Energy Commission, administer the utility’s continuation of the New Solar Homes Partnership Program. After the exhaustion of funds, the Energy Commission shall notify the Joint Legislative Budget Committee 30 days prior to the continuation of the program.
(4) The changes made to this subdivision by Chapter 39 of the Statutes of 2012 do not authorize the levy of a charge or any increase in the amount collected pursuant to any existing charge, nor do the changes add to, or detract from, the commission’s existing authority to levy or increase charges.
(f) Upon the expenditure or reservation in any electrical corporation’s service territory of the amount specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) for low-income residential housing programs pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 2852, the commission shall authorize the continued collection of the charge for the purposes of Section 2852. The commission shall ensure that the total amount collected pursuant to this subdivision does not exceed one hundred eight million dollars ($108,000,000). Upon approval by the commission, an electrical corporation may use amounts collected pursuant to subdivision (e) for purposes of funding the general market portion of the California Solar Initiative, that remain unspent and unencumbered after December 31, 2016, to reduce the electrical corporation’s portion of the total amount collected pursuant to this subdivision.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, as defined. Decisions of the commission adopted the California Solar Initiative. Existing law requires the commission to undertake certain steps in implementing the California Solar Initiative.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to the law requiring the commission to undertake certain steps in implementing the California Solar Initiative.","An act to amend Section 2851 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","Existing law allows an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer to request a court to issue a gun violence restraining order to enjoin a person from owning or possessing a firearm or ammunition for a period of one year upon a showing that the person poses a significant danger of personal injury to himself, herself, or another and that a gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent that injury. Existing law requires a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to surrender his or her firearms and ammunition immediately upon request of any law enforcement officer. If no request is made, existing law requires the person to surrender his or her firearms or ammunition to a local law enforcement agency or to sell his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer within 24 hours.
Existing law allows any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm to transfer his or her firearms to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition.
This bill would allow a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to transfer his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition. If the firearms or ammunition have been surrendered to a law enforcement agency, the bill would entitle the owner to have them transferred to a licensed firearms dealer. The bill would additionally provide for the transfer of ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer by any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing ammunition. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law allows a city, county, or city and county to impose a charge relating to the seizure, impounding, storage, or release of a firearm, which may not exceed the actual costs incurred for expenses directly related to taking possession of a firearm, storing the firearm, and surrendering possession of the firearm to a licensed firearm dealer or to the owner.
This bill would extend the authority to impose this charge for the above specified activities in regard to ammunition.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 18120, 29830, and 33880 of the Penal Code, relating to firearms."

(1) The working men and women in California law enforcement risk their lives every day. The people of California greatly appreciate the hard work and dedication of peace officers in protecting public safety. The good name of these officers should not be tarnished by the actions of those few who commit discriminatory practices.
(2) Racial or identity profiling is a practice that presents a great danger to the fundamental principles of our Constitution and a democratic society. It is abhorrent and cannot be tolerated.
(3) Racial or identity profiling alienates people from law enforcement, hinders community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to lose credibility and trust among the people whom law enforcement is sworn to protect and serve.
(4) Pedestrians, users of public transportation, and vehicular occupants who have been stopped, searched, interrogated, and subjected to a property seizure by a peace officer for no reason other than the color of their skin, national origin, religion, gender identity or expression, housing status, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability are the victims of discriminatory practices.
(5) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting the changes to this section made by the act that added this paragraph that additional training is required to address the pernicious practice of racial or identity profiling and that enactment of this section is in no way dispositive of the issue of how the state should deal with racial or identity profiling.

The course of instruction shall include, but not be limited to, significant consideration of each of the following subjects:
(1) Identification of key indices and perspectives that make up racial, identity, and cultural differences among residents in a local community.
(2) Negative impact of intentional and implicit biases, prejudices, and stereotyping on effective law enforcement, including examination of how historical perceptions of discriminatory enforcement practices have harmed police-community relations and contributed to injury, death, disparities in arrest detention and incarceration rights, and wrongful convictions.
(3) The history and role of the civil and human rights movement and struggles and their impact on law enforcement.
(4) Specific obligations of peace officers in preventing, reporting, and responding to discriminatory or biased practices by fellow peace officers.
(5) Perspectives of diverse, local constituency groups and experts on particular racial, identity, and cultural and police-community relations issues in a local area.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law creates the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training and requires it to develop and disseminate guidelines and training for all law enforcement officers, as described. Existing law prohibits a peace officer from engaging in racial profiling and requires the training to prescribe patterns, practices, and protocols that prevent racial profiling, as defined. Existing law requires the Legislative Analyst’s Office to conduct a study of the data that is voluntarily collected by jurisdictions that have instituted a program of data collection with regard to racial profiling.
This bill would enact the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015, which would, among other changes, revise the definition of racial profiling to instead refer to racial or identity profiling, and make a conforming change to the prohibition against peace officers engaging in that practice.
The bill would require, beginning July 1, 2016, the Attorney General to establish the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) to eliminate racial and identity profiling and improve diversity and racial and identity sensitivity in law enforcement. The bill would specify the composition of the board. The bill would require the board, among other duties, to investigate and analyze state and local law enforcement agencies’ racial and identity profiling policies and practices across geographic areas in California, to annually make publicly available its findings and policy recommendations, to hold public meetings annually, as specified, and to issue the board’s first annual report no later than January 1, 2018.
The bill would require each state and local agency that employs peace officers to annually report to the Attorney General data on all stops, as defined, conducted by the agency’s peace officers, and require that data to include specified information, including the time, date, and location of the stop, and the reason for the stop. The bill would require an agency that employs 1,000 or more peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2019. The bill would require an agency that employs 667 or more but less than 1,000 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2020. The bill would require an agency that employs 334 or more but less than 667 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2022. The bill would require an agency that employs one or more but less than 334 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2023.
By imposing a higher level of service on local entities that employ peace officers, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 12525.5 to the Government Code, and to amend Sections 13012 and 13519.4 of the Penal Code, relating to racial profiling."
681,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares
the following:
as follows:
(a) Many areas of the state are disproportionately impacted by drought because they are heavily dependent or completely reliant on groundwater from basins that are in overdraft and in which the water table declines year after year or from basins that are contaminated.
(b) There are a number of state grant and loan programs that provide financial assistance to communities to address drinking water and wastewater needs. Unfortunately, there is no program in place to provide similar assistance to individual homeowners who are reliant on their own groundwater wells and who may not be able to afford conventional private loans to undertake vital water supply, water quality, and wastewater improvements.
(c) The program created by this act is intended to bridge that gap by providing low-interest loans, grants, or both, to individual homeowners to undertake actions necessary to provide safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment. These actions may include, but are not limited to, digging deeper wells, improving existing wells and related equipment, addressing drinking water contaminants in the homeowner’s water, or connecting to a local water or wastewater system.
SEC. 2.
Chapter 6.6 (commencing with Section 13486) is added to Division 7 of the Water Code, to read:
CHAPTER  6.6. Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program
13486.
(a) The board shall establish a program in accordance with this chapter to provide low-interest loans and grants to local agencies for low-interest loans and grants to eligible applicants for any of the following purposes:
(1) Extending or connecting service lines from a water or wastewater system to the applicant’s residence or plumbing.
(2) Paying reasonable charges or fees for connecting to a water or wastewater system.
(3) Paying costs to close abandoned septic tanks and water wells, as necessary, to protect health and safety as required by local or state law.
(4) Deepening an existing groundwater well.
(5) Improving an existing groundwater well, including associated equipment.
(6) Installing a water treatment system if the groundwater exceeds a primary or secondary drinking standard, as defined in Section 116275 of the Health and Safety Code.
(b) The board may adopt any regulation it determines is necessary to carry out the purposes of the chapter. A regulation adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall not be subject to the rulemaking requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
13487.
(a) The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is hereby created in the State Treasury. The moneys in the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the board for expenditure in accordance with this chapter.
(b) The following moneys shall be deposited in the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund:
(1) Moneys repaid to the board pursuant to a grant or loan made in accordance with this chapter, including interest payments.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 16475 of the Government Code, any interest earned upon the moneys in the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund.
13488.
(a) An eligible applicant for a loan shall meet all of the following criteria:
(1) Have a household income below the statewide median household income.
(2) Have an ownership interest in the residence.
(3) Be unable to obtain financial assistance at reasonable terms and conditions from private lenders and lack the personal resources to undertake these improvements.
(4) Demonstrate an ability to repay the loan. This requirement may be satisfied by having another party join the application as a cosigner.
(b) Any loan granted shall be secured by a mortgage on the residence and repaid within 20 years in accordance with terms established by the board. The interest rate on the loan shall not exceed 1 percent. While any balance on the loan is outstanding, a loan recipient shall furnish evidence of and continually maintain homeowner’s insurance on the security residence to protect the state’s interest in the residence.
(c) The board may enter into a contract with a private financial institution to provide loans consistent with the purposes of this chapter. If the board exercises this authority, the board may utilize a portion of the moneys in the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund to provide a loan guarantee or similar loss mitigation mechanism.
13489.
(a) An eligible applicant for a grant shall meet all of the following criteria:
(1) Have a household income that is 60 percent or less of the statewide median household income.
(2) Have an ownership interest in the residence.
(3) Be unable to obtain financial assistance at reasonable terms and conditions from private lenders and lack the personal resources to undertake these improvements.
(b) A grant recipient shall repay to the board the grant amount in full if that recipient sells the residence less than five years from the date that the grant agreement was signed.
(c) A grant recipient shall repay to the board any unused grant funds.
SEC. 3.
Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is hereby transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to provide eligible households with access to safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment during California’s prolonged drought, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law, the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Law of 1997, establishes the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to provide grants or revolving fund loans for the design and construction of projects for public water systems that will enable those systems to meet safe drinking water standards.
This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board to establish a program to provide low-interest loans and grants to local agencies for low-interest loans and grants to eligible applicants for specified purposes relating to drinking water and wastewater treatment. This bill would create the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund and provide that the moneys in this fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the board for expenditure for the program. This bill would transfer to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund $10,000,000 from the General Fund.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add Chapter 6.6 (commencing with Section 13486) to Division 7 of the Water Code, relating to water, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
682,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is the goal of state government, in collecting demographic data, to gather accurate information in order to understand, compare, report, and apply that data to the enhancement and improvement of public services.
(b) Currently, the state does not consistently collect demographic data related to sexual orientation or gender identity.
(c) The limited data available for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) communities includes all of the following:
(1) According to a University of California, Los Angeles, study from the Williams Institute, nearly one in five children being raised by same-sex couples (approximately 24 percent) live in poverty compared to 14 percent of children being raised by different-sex couples.
(2) Data from a 2013 Williams Institute report on patterns of poverty of LGBT communities shows that one-third of lesbian couples and 20.1 percent of gay male couples without a high school diploma are in poverty, compared to 18.8 percent of different-sex married couples. The report further showed African American same-sex couples have poverty rates more than twice the rate of different-sex married African American couples and there are high levels of poverty in bisexual individuals in California reaching approximately 25 percent of bisexual people compared to 17 percent for heterosexual people.
(3) According to the California Department of Justice, in 2013, hate crimes with a sexual orientation bias motivation were the second most common type of hate crime, comprising 25 percent of all hate crimes.
(4) Various studies, including those by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Institute of Medicine, found that health disparities impacting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender include higher risks for cancer, mental illness, and other diseases, as well as higher rates of smoking and substance abuse.
(5) Research from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Questioning (LGBTQ) Reducing Disparities Project found that LGBTQ respondents statewide reported troublesome experiences with service providers in regard to how accepting or rejecting service providers have been of their sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. Further, LGBTQ respondents reported difficulty finding providers knowledgeable and accepting of sexual orientation and gender identity concerns.
(d) Due to historical systemic exclusion of data collection of LGBT communities, significant disparities in their health and welfare have been prolonged compared to the broader community. LGBT communities face disproportionately high rates of poverty, suicide, homelessness, isolation, substance abuse, and violence, and low rates of health insurance. These problems are more prevalent for youth and seniors, communities of color, and bisexual and transgender and undocumented communities.
(e) It is in the best interests of the state to respect, embrace, and understand the full diversity of its residents and to collect accurate data to effectively implement and deliver critical state services and programs.
(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that the state departments specified in Section 8310.8 of the Government Code, as added by Section 2 of this act, utilize existing work and research, including, but not limited to, referencing research on promising and community-defined practices and stakeholders when developing questions to collect voluntary self-identified information pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that the state departments specified in subdivision (a) of Section 8310.8 of the Government Code, as added by Section 2 of this act, that collect demographic data consider urging the collection of voluntary self-identified information pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity in circumstances where an entity not covered by this act does not already collect this information.
SEC. 2.
Section 8310.8 is added to the Government Code, to read:
8310.8.
(a) (1) This section shall only apply to the following state departments:
(A) The State Department of Health Care Services.
(B) The State Department of Public Health.
(C) The State Department of Social Services.
(D) The California Department of Aging.
(2) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Disparities Reduction Act.
(b) (1) Except as specified in paragraph (2), in addition to the duties imposed by Section 8310.5 and to the extent permissible by federal law, the state departments identified in subdivision (a), in the course of collecting demographic data directly or by contract as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of Californians, shall collect voluntary self-identification information pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity.
(2) The departments identified in subdivision (a) may, but are not required to, collect demographic data pursuant to this section under either of the following circumstances:
(A) Pursuant to federal programs or surveys, whereby the guidelines for demographic data collection categories are defined by the federal program or survey.
(B) Demographic data is collected by other entities including:
(i) State offices, departments, and agencies not included in subdivision (a).
(ii) Surveys administered by third-party entities and where the state department is not the sole funder.
(c) (1) During the regular process of reporting of demographic data to the Legislature, the state departments identified in subdivision (a) shall report the data collected pursuant to this section and the method used to collect that data, and make the data available to the public in accordance with state and federal law, except for personal identifying information, which shall be deemed confidential and shall not be disclosed.
(2) The state departments identified in subdivision (a) shall not report demographic data that would permit identification of individuals or would result in statistical unreliability. Demographic reports on data collected pursuant to this section, to prevent identification of individuals, may aggregate categories at a state, county, city, census tract, or zip code level to facilitate comparisons and identify disparities.
(3) The state departments identified in subdivision (a) may use information voluntarily provided about sexual orientation and gender identity only for demographic analysis, coordination of care, quality improvement of its services, conducting approved research, fulfilling reporting requirements, and guiding policy or funding decisions. All information about sexual orientation and gender identity collected pursuant to this section shall be used only for purposes specified in this section.
(d) The state departments identified in subdivision (a) shall come into compliance with the requirements of this section as early as possible following the effective date of this section, but no later than July 1, 2018.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 8310.8 to the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
Due to the sensitive general nature of data relating to sexual orientation and gender identity and the need to protect the safety of those who would provide voluntary self-identification information pertaining to their sexual orientation and gender identity, it is necessary to prohibit the public disclosure of personal identifying information that would allow the identification of an individual who provided voluntary self-identification information pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity.","(1) Existing law requires a state agency, board, or commission that directly or by contract collects demographic data as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of Californians to use separate collection categories and tabulations for each major Asian and Pacific Islander groups, as specified.
This bill would require 4 specific state departments, in the course of collecting demographic data directly or by contract as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of Californians, to collect voluntary self-identification information pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity, except as specified. This bill would require these state departments, during the regular process of reporting of demographic data to the Legislature, to report the collected data and method used to collect the data and make the data available to the public in accordance with state and federal law, except for personal identifying information, which shall be deemed confidential and prohibited from disclosure. The bill would prohibit these state departments from reporting demographic data that would permit identification of individuals or would result in statistical unreliability. The bill would limit the use of the collected data by these state departments, as specified. The bill would require these state departments to come into compliance with these provisions as early as possible, but no later than July 1, 2018. This bill would make legislative findings and declarations relating to this act.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Section 8310.8 to the Government Code, relating to data collection."

SECTION 1.
Section 7613 of the Family Code is amended to read:
7613.
(a) If a woman conceives through assisted reproduction with semen or ova or both donated by a donor not her spouse, with the consent of another intended parent, that intended parent is treated in law as if he or she were the natural parent of a child thereby conceived. The other intended parent’s consent shall be in writing and signed by the other intended parent and the woman conceiving through assisted reproduction.
(b) (1) The donor of semen provided to a licensed physician and surgeon or to a licensed sperm bank for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor’s spouse is treated in law as if he were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived, unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the woman prior to the conception of the child.
(2) If the semen is not provided to a licensed physician and surgeon or a licensed sperm bank as specified in paragraph (1), the donor of semen for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor’s spouse is treated in law as if he were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived if either of the following are met:
(A) The donor and the woman agreed in a writing signed prior to conception that the donor would not be a parent.
(B) A court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through assisted reproduction and that, prior to the conception of the child, the woman and the donor had an oral agreement that the donor would not be a parent.
(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to a man who provided semen for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the man’s spouse pursuant to a written agreement signed by the man and the woman prior to conception of the child stating that they intended for the man to be a parent.
(c) The donor of ova for use in assisted reproduction by a woman other than the donor’s spouse or nonmarital partner is treated in law as if she were not the natural parent of a child thereby conceived unless the court finds satisfactory evidence that the donor and the woman intended for the donor to be a parent.

These forms shall satisfy the writing requirement specified in Section 7613, and are designed to provide clarity regarding the intentions, at the time of conception, of intended parents using assisted reproduction. These forms do not affect any presumptions of parentage based on Section 7611, and do not preclude a court from considering any other claims to parentage under California statute or case law.
(b) These forms apply only in very limited circumstances. Please read the forms carefully to see if you qualify for use of the forms.
(c) These forms do not apply to assisted reproduction agreements for gestational carriers or surrogacy agreements.

Proposition 83 provides that the Legislature may amend the provisions of the act to expand the scope of their application or increase the punishment or penalties by a statute passed by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature.
This bill would add the crimes of rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation, perpetrated against a person who is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, to the above provisions, if the victim is developmentally disabled, as defined. By applying the above enhancements to these crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to investigate and enforce statutes and orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission that, among other things, specify the requirements for the payment of wages by employers. Existing law provides for criminal and civil penalties for violations of statutes and orders of the commission regarding payment of wages.
This bill would, in addition, authorize the Labor Commissioner to investigate and, upon a request from the local entity, to enforce local laws regarding overtime hours or minimum wage provisions and to issue citations and penalties for violations, except when the local entity has already issued a citation for the same violation. The bill would prohibit a local entity from issuing a citation to the employer if the Labor Commissioner has already issued a citation to that employer for the same violation. This bill also would make related conforming changes. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires an employer to indemnify his or her employees for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee’s duties or as a result of obeying the employer’s directions. Existing law provides an aggrieved employee with a private right of action to recover these expenditures.
This bill would, additionally, authorize the Labor Commissioner to enforce these provisions by issuing citations and penalties to employers for violations of this requirement, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 558, 1197, 1197.1, and 2802 of the Labor Code, relating to employment."

SECTION 1.
Section 8263 of the Education Code is amended to read:
8263.
(a) The Superintendent shall adopt rules and regulations on eligibility, enrollment, and priority of services needed to implement this chapter. In order to be eligible for federal and state subsidized child development services, families shall meet at least one requirement in each of the following areas:
(1) A family is (A) a current aid recipient, (B) income eligible, (C) homeless, or (D) one whose children are recipients of protective services, or whose children have been identified as being abused, neglected, or exploited, or at risk of being abused, neglected, or exploited.
(2) A family needs the child care services (A) because the child is identified by a legal, medical, or social services agency, a local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youths designated pursuant to Section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of Title 42 of the United States Code, a Head Start program, or an emergency or transitional shelter as (i) a recipient of protective services, (ii) being neglected, abused, or exploited, or at risk of neglect, abuse, or exploitation, or (iii) being homeless or (B) because the parents are (i) engaged in vocational training leading directly to a recognized trade, paraprofession, or profession, (ii) employed or seeking employment, (iii) seeking permanent housing for family stability, or (iv) incapacitated.
(b) Except as provided in Article 15.5 (commencing with Section 8350), priority for federal and state subsidized child development services is as follows:
(1) (A) First priority shall be given to neglected or abused children who are recipients of child protective services, or children who are at risk of being neglected or abused, upon written referral from a legal, medical, or social services agency. If an agency is unable to enroll a child in the first priority category, the agency shall refer the family to local resource and referral services to locate services for the child.
(B) A family who is receiving child care on the basis of being a child at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, as defined in subdivision (k) of Section 8208, is eligible to receive services pursuant to subparagraph (A) for up to three months, unless the family becomes eligible pursuant to subparagraph (C).
(C) A family may receive child care services for up to 12 months on the basis of a certification by the county child welfare agency that child care services continue to be necessary or, if the child is receiving child protective services during that period of time, and the family requires child care and remains otherwise eligible. This time limit does not apply if the family’s child care referral is recertified by the county child welfare agency.
(2) Second priority shall be given equally to eligible families, regardless of the number of parents in the home, who are income eligible. Within this priority, families with the lowest gross monthly income in relation to family size, as determined by a schedule adopted by the Superintendent, shall be admitted first. If two or more families are in the same priority in relation to income, the family that has a child with exceptional needs shall be admitted first. If there is no family of the same priority with a child with exceptional needs, the same priority family that has been on the waiting list for the longest time shall be admitted first. For purposes of determining order of admission, the grants of public assistance recipients shall be counted as income.
(3) The Superintendent shall set criteria for, and may grant specific waivers of, the priorities established in this subdivision for agencies that wish to serve specific populations, including children with exceptional needs or children of prisoners. These new waivers shall not include proposals to avoid appropriate fee schedules or admit ineligible families, but may include proposals to accept members of special populations in other than strict income order, as long as appropriate fees are paid.
(c) Notwithstanding any other law, in order to promote continuity of services, a family enrolled in a state or federally funded child care and development program whose services would otherwise be terminated because the family no longer meets the program income, eligibility, or need criteria may continue to receive child development services in another state or federally funded child care and development program if the contractor is able to transfer the family’s enrollment to another program for which the family is eligible before the date of termination of services or to exchange the family’s existing enrollment with the enrollment of a family in another program, provided that both families satisfy the eligibility requirements for the program in which they are being enrolled. The transfer of enrollment may be to another program within the same administrative agency or to another agency that administers state or federally funded child care and development programs.
(d) In order to promote continuity of services, the Superintendent may extend the 60-working-day period specified in subdivision (a) of Section 18086.5 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations for an additional 60 working days if he or she determines that opportunities for employment have diminished to the degree that one or both parents cannot reasonably be expected to find employment within 60 working days and granting the extension is in the public interest. The scope of extensions granted pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the necessary geographic areas and affected persons, which shall be described in the Superintendent’s order granting the extension. It is the intent of the Legislature that extensions granted pursuant to this subdivision improve services in areas with high unemployment rates and areas with disproportionately high numbers of seasonal agricultural jobs.
(e) A physical examination and evaluation, including age-appropriate immunization, shall be required before, or within six weeks of, enrollment. A standard, rule, or regulation shall not require medical examination or immunization for admission to a child care and development program of a child whose parent or guardian files a letter with the governing board of the child care and development program stating that the medical examination or immunization is contrary to his or her religious beliefs, or provide for the exclusion of a child from the program because of a parent or guardian having filed the letter. However, if there is good cause to believe that a child is suffering from a recognized contagious or infectious disease, the child shall be temporarily excluded from the program until the governing board of the child care and development program is satisfied that the child is not suffering from that contagious or infectious disease.
(f) Regulations formulated and promulgated pursuant to this section shall include the recommendations of the State Department of Health Care Services relative to health care screening and the provision of health care services. The Superintendent shall seek the advice and assistance of these health authorities in situations where service under this chapter includes or requires care of children who are ill or children with exceptional needs.
(g) The Superintendent shall establish guidelines for the collection of employer-sponsored child care benefit payments from a parent whose child receives subsidized child care and de","Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to adopt rules and regulations on eligibility, enrollment, and priority of services needed to implement laws relating to child care and development services.

CHAPTER  2.97. Veterans Courts
1001.100.
(a) Except as provided in Section 1001.101, each superior court shall develop and implement a veterans court.
(b) A veterans court established pursuant to this chapter shall accomplish all of the following objectives:
(1) Increase cooperation between the courts, criminal justice, veterans, and substance abuse systems.
(2) Create a dedicated calendar or a locally developed collaborative court-supervised veterans mental health program or system that contains the characteristics set out in subdivision (c) that will lead to placement of as many mentally ill offenders who are veterans of the United States military, including those with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, substance abuse, or any mental health problem stemming from United States military service, in community treatment, as is feasible and consistent with public safety.
(3) Improve access to necessary services and support.

(1) Leadership by a superior court judicial officer assigned by the presiding judge.
(2) Enhanced accountability by combining judicial supervision with rehabilitation services that are rigorously monitored and focused on recovery.
(3) A problem solving focus.
(4) A team approach to decisionmaking, including, but not limited to, involving the defendant who is a veteran in the creation of a treatment plan and goals.
(5) Integration of social and treatment services.
(6) Judicial supervision of the treatment process, as appropriate.
(7) Community outreach efforts.
(8) Direct interaction between defendant and judicial officer.
(d) (1) The county and court stakeholders shall utilize a collaborative process to develop a plan for a veterans court that satisfies the requirements of this section.
(2) At least one stakeholder shall be a criminal justice client who is a veteran who has lived with the experience of mental illness as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).
(3) The plan shall incorporate as many of the following components as feasible:
(A) The method by which the veterans court ensures that the target population of defendants are identified and referred to the veterans court.
(B) The method for assessing defendants who are veterans for serious mental illness and co-occurring disorders.
(C) Eligibility criteria specifying what factors make the defendant eligible to participate in the veterans court, including service in the United States military, the amenability of the defendant to treatment and the facts of the case, as well as prior criminal history, United States military service history, and mental health and substance abuse treatment history.
(D) The elements of the treatment and supervision programs.
(E) Standards for continuing participation in, and successful completion of, the veterans court program.
(F) The need for all service providers and stakeholders to receive initial and ongoing training from county departments and community stakeholders with specialized knowledge about veterans’ treatment and service needs, such as the county health department, county veterans officers, county drug and alcohol department, and Veterans Administration partners, and the need to provide initial and ongoing training for designated staff on the nature of serious mental illness and on the treatment and supportive services available in the community.
(G) The process to ensure defendants will receive the appropriate level of treatment services with emphasis on maximizing federally funded services from the Veterans Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the county and other local mental health and substance abuse treatment services to the extent that resources are available for that purpose, as described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(H) The process for developing or modifying a treatment plan for each defendant, based on a formal assessment of the defendant’s mental health, United States military service history, and substance abuse treatment needs. Participation in the veterans court shall require defendants to complete the recommended treatment plan, and comply with any other terms and conditions that optimizes the likelihood that the defendant completes the program.
(I) The process for referring cases to the veterans court.
(J) A defendant’s voluntary entry into the veterans court, the right of a defendant to withdraw from the veterans court, and the process for explaining these rights to the defendant.
(e) (1) A veterans court shall be administered by a veterans court team led by a judicial officer to preside over the court.
(2) Other members of the veterans court team shall, to the extent feasible, include, but not be limited to, a prosecutor, a public defender, a county mental health liaison, a substance abuse liaison, a county veterans’ service officer, a probation officer, and a Veterans Administration social worker to assist the court with screening veterans court candidates for eligibility and suitability in Veterans Administration funded programs.
(3) The veterans court team shall determine the frequency of ongoing reviews of the progress of the offender in community treatment in order to ensure the offender adheres to the treatment plan as recommended, remains in treatment, and completes treatment.

(1) Reduce costs to the state through decreased recidivism in a manner consistent with 2011 Realignment.
(2) Provide a veterans court judge a variety of options for carrying out the goal to ensure long-term public safety by maximizing the opportunities for veterans with psychological war wounds to get timely and appropriate treatment.
(3) Ensure that a veterans court judge exercises discretion and uses all tools available to ensure public safety and assist defendants to successfully complete appropriate treatment for the problems underlying their offenses.
(4) Augment, rather than replace, other sections within this code.
(5) Ensure a holistic approach that the priority underlying offense is treated and that offense-specific education and counseling aims are met. Where there are statutory requirements for certain education or counseling programs to be included in the terms of probation, for example, first conviction programs for driving under the influence offenders under Section 23152 of the Vehicle Code or domestic violence offenders under Section 273.5 of the Penal Code, it is the intent of the Legislature that the components of those offense-specific counseling terms be incorporated into the treatment programs that are designed to treat the underlying psychological disorders rather than required in lieu of the psychological treatments.
1001.101.
In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 1001.100, a superior court may partner with another superior court in the same county or a superior court in a neighboring county to provide access to a veterans court if that veterans court satisfies the requirements of Section 1001.100.

(b) The Legislature recognizes that federal law affords similar protection to a person making such a request, as articulated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its interpretative guidance of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352, as amended). The Legislature affirms that the federal acts provide a floor of protection and that this state’s law has always exceeded in the protections afforded.
(c) The law of this state contains similar protections for a person making a request for reasonable accommodation under the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law (Section 12945 of the Government Code) and the California Family Rights Act (Sections 12945.2 and 19702.3 of the Government Code). It is the intent of the Legislature for the protections afforded a person making a request for accommodation on the basis of religion or disability to be consistent with the provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Part 2.8 (commencing with Section 12900) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(d) Notwithstanding any interpretation of this issue in Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Washington, Inc., (2013) 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, the Legislature intends (1) to make clear that a request for reasonable accommodation on the basis of religion or disability is a protected activity, and (2) by enacting paragraph (2) of subdivision (m) and paragraph (4) of subdivision (l) of Section 12940, to provide protection against retaliation when an individual makes a request for reasonable accommodation under these sections, regardless of whether the request was granted. With the exception of its holding on this issue, Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Washington, Inc., (2013) 220 Cal. App. 4th 635 remains good law.
SEC. 2.
Section 12940 of the Government Code is amended to read:
12940.
It is an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California:
(a) For an employer, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment, or to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.
(1) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability, or subject an employer to any legal liability resulting from the refusal to employ or the discharge of an employee with a physical or mental disability, where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations.
(2) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee who, because of the employee’s medical condition, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee’s health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations. Nothing in this part shall subject an employer to any legal liability resulting from the refusal to employ or the discharge of an employee who, because of the employee’s medical condition, is unable to perform his or her essential duties, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee’s health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations.
(3) Nothing in this part relating to discrimination on account of marital status shall do either of the following:
(A) Affect the right of an employer to reasonably regulate, for reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale, the working of spouses in the same department, division, or facility, consistent with the rules and regulations adopted by the commission.
(B) Prohibit bona fide health plans from providing additional or greater benefits to employees with dependents than to those employees without or with fewer dependents.
(4) Nothing in this part relating to discrimination on account of sex shall affect the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in employee selection or to give special consideration to Vietnam-era veterans.
(5) (A) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to employ an individual because of his or her age if the law compels or provides for that refusal. Promotions within the existing staff, hiring or promotion on the basis of experience and training, rehiring on the basis of seniority and prior service with the employer, or hiring under an established recruiting program from high schools, colleges, universities, or trade schools do not, in and of themselves, constitute unlawful employment practices.
(B) The provisions of this part relating to discrimination on the basis of age do not prohibit an employer from providing health benefits or health care reimbursement plans to retired persons that are altered, reduced, or eliminated when the person becomes eligible for Medicare health benefits. This subparagraph applies to all retiree health benefit plans and contractual provisions or practices concerning retiree health benefits and health care reimbursement plans in effect on or after January 1, 2011.
(b) For a labor organization, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person, to exclude, expel, or restrict from its membership the person, or to provide only second-class or segregated membership or to discriminate against any person because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of the person in the election of officers of the labor organization or in the selection of the labor organization’s staff or to discriminate in any way against any of its members or against any employer or against any person employed by an employer.
(c) For any person to discriminate against any person in the selection, termination, training, or other terms or treatment of that person in any apprenticeship training program, any other training program leading to employment, an unpaid internship, or another limited duration program to provide unpaid work experience for that person because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of the person discriminated against.
(d) For any employer or employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any publication, or to make any nonjob-related inquiry of an employee or applicant, either verbal or through use of an application form, that expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification, or discrimination. This part does not prohibit an employer or employment agency from inquiring into the age of an applicant, or from specifying age limitations, where the law compels or provides for that action.
(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), for any employer or employment agency to require any medical or psychological examination of an applicant, to make any medical or psychological inquiry of an applicant, to make any inquiry whether an applicant has a mental disability or physical disability or medical condition, or to make any inquiry regarding the nature or severity of a physical disability, mental disability, or medical condition.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may inquire into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions and may respond to an applicant’s request for reasonable accommodation.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may require a medical or psychological examination or make a medical or psychological inquiry of a job applicant after an employment offer has been made but prior to the commencement of employment duties, provided that the examination or inquiry is job related and consistent with business necessity and that all entering employees in the same job classification are subject to the same examination or inquiry.
(f) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), for any employer or employment agency to require any medical or psychological examination of an employee, to make any medical or psychological inquiry of an employee, to make any inquiry whether an employee has a mental disability, physical disability, or medical condition, or to make any inquiry regarding the nature or severity of a physical disability, mental disability, or medical condition.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may require any examinations or inquiries that it can show to be job related and consistent with business necessity. An employer or employment agency may conduct voluntary medical examinations, including voluntary medical histories, which are part of an employee health program available to employees at that worksite.
(g) For any employer, labor organization, or employment agency to harass, discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has made a report pursuant to Section 11161.8 of the Penal Code that prohibits retaliation against hospital employees who report suspected patient abuse by health facilities or community care facilities.
(h) For any employer, labor organization, employment agency, or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.
(i) For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this part, or to attempt to do so.
(j) (1) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program or any training program leading to employment, or any other person, because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status, to harass an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract. Harassment of an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract by an employee, other than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. An employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees, applicants, unpaid interns or volunteers, or persons providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace, where the employer, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing cases involving the acts of nonemployees, the extent of the employer’s control and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have with respect to the conduct of those nonemployees shall be considered. An entity shall take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring. Loss of tangible job benefits shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment.
(2) The provisions of this subdivision are declaratory of existing law, except for the new duties imposed on employers with regard to harassment.
(3) An employee of an entity subject to this subdivision is personally liable for any harassment prohibited by this section that is perpetrated by the employee, regardless of whether the employer or covered entity knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.
(4) (A) For purposes of this subdivision only, “employer” means any person regularly employing one or more persons or regularly receiving the services of one or more persons providing services pursuant to a contract, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the state, or any political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities. The definition of “employer” in subdivision (d) of Section 12926 applies to all provisions of this section other than this subdivision.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for purposes of this subdivision, “employer” does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit, except as provided in Section 12926.2.
(C) For purposes of this subdivision, “harassment” because of sex includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Sexually harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “a person providing services pursuant to a contract” means a person who meets all of the following criteria:
(A) The person has the right to control the performance of the contract for services and discretion as to the manner of performance.
(B) The person is customarily engaged in an independently established business.
(C) The person has control over the time and place the work is performed, supplies the tools and instruments used in the work, and performs work that requires a particular skill not ordinarily used in the course of the employer’s work.
(k) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.
(l) (1) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to refuse to hire or employ a person or to refuse to select a person for a training program leading to employment or to bar or to discharge a person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against a person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of a conflict between the person’s religious belief or observance and any employment requirement, unless the employer or other entity covered by this part demonstrates that it has explored any available reasonable alternative means of accommodating the religious belief or observance, including the possibilities of excusing the person from those duties that conflict with his or her religious belief or observance or permitting those duties to be performed at another time or by another person, but is unable to reasonably accommodate the religious belief or observance without undue hardship, as defined in subdivision (u) of Section 12926, on the conduct of the business of the employer or other entity covered by this part. Religious belief or observance, as used in this section, includes, but is not limited to, observance of a Sabbath or other religious holy day or days, reasonable time necessary for travel prior and subsequent to a religious observance, and religious dress practice and religious grooming practice as described in subdivision (q) of Section 12926. This subdivision shall also apply to an apprenticeship training program, an unpaid internship, and any other program to provide unpaid experience for a person in the workplace or industry.
(2) An accommodation of an individual’s religious dress practice or religious grooming practice is not reasonable if the accommodation requires segregation of the individual from other employees or the public.
(3) An accommodation is not required under this subdivision if it would result in a violation of this part or any other law prohibiting discrimination or protecting civil rights, including subdivision (b) of Section 51 of the Civil Code and Section 11135 of this code.
(4) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to, in addition to the employee protections provided pursuant to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted.
(m) (1) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Nothing in this subdivision or in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer or other covered entity to produce undue hardship, as defined in subdivision (u) of Section 12926, to its operation.
(2) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to, in addition to the employee protections provided pursuant to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted.
(n) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition.
(o) For an employer or other entity covered by this part, to subject, directly or indirectly, any employee, applicant, or other person to a test for the presence of a genetic characteristic.
(p) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as preventing the ability of employers to identify members of the military or veterans for purposes of awarding a veteran’s preference as permitted by law.","Existing law, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, protects and safeguards the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination, abridgment, or harassment on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status.
Existing law requires an employer or other entity covered by the act to provide reasonable accommodation of, among other things, a person’s disability and religious beliefs and prohibits discrimination against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under the act or because the person has filed a complaint.
This bill would, in addition, prohibit an employer or other covered entity from retaliating or otherwise discriminating against a person for requesting accommodation of his or her disability or religious beliefs, regardless of whether the accommodation request was granted. The bill would make related findings and declarations.","An act to amend Section 12940 of the Government Code, relating to employment."

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Park access, outdoor education, and outdoor recreational experiences are important to the health and well-being of all California citizens as well as the continuing stewardship of our natural resources. Many California communities, however, lack equitable access to parks and other open-space areas. This lack of access to the outdoors contributes to higher incidences of certain health ailments, such as diabetes, hypertension,
obesity,
and nature deficit disorder, and other negative social indicators, especially in low-income communities.
(2) According to the recent Parks Forward Commission report,
released in February 2015,
improving access to parks, outdoor experiences, and recreational opportunities, particularly for youth and young adults in disadvantaged communities, will lead to more healthy lifestyles, better educational outcomes, and improvements to the overall well-being of
California citizens,
California’s citizens
and
communities,
and
as well as
our natural environment.
(3)
The Legislature enacted
Chapter 663 of the Statutes of
2003, which
2003
established the Outdoor Environmental Education Program and required a study on the benefits of outdoor environmental education for at-risk youth and underserved demographic groups. The study found that the science test scores of children who participated in the program were raised by 27 percent, and that these children also had improved conflict resolution and problem solving skills, better self-esteem, and were more motivated to learn. The program ended on July 1, 2005.
(4)
The Legislature enacted
Resolution Chapter 101 of the Statutes of
2006, which
2006
recognized the importance of local recreational and park agencies in the effort to reverse negative trends in inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and other health problems among Californians and encouraged the state to use, and partner with, local recreation and park providers to create a healthier state.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to expand access to parks and other outdoor educational and recreational opportunities in underserved areas by, among other things, convening and developing strategic partnerships to facilitate, promote, and enhance access to parks, as well as outdoor educational and recreational experiences in underserved communities.

(2) Applicants that serve children with family incomes below the statewide average, based on the most recent figures computed and established by the Department of Finance.
(3) Applicants that provide access to children who are underserved or lack access to parks or other outdoor venues suitable to conduct appropriate environmental education instruction.

(e) Applicant agencies may enter into contracts with other public agencies or entities to provide unique interpretive skills or to present authentic, curriculum-based programs in units of conservancy properties or state, community, or regional park systems for services not otherwise provided. The purpose of this subdivision is to authorize the applicants to provide programming services, equipment, and materials that assist in the curriculum program or provide educational activities that assist in the presentation of cultural traditions.","Existing law authorizes the expenditure of state funds for local assistance grants to cities, counties, and districts for the acquisition and development of various park and recreational areas and facilities. Existing law, the State Urban Parks and Healthy Communities Act, requires the Director of Parks and Recreation, in consultation with the State Department of Education, to develop a competitive grant program to assist state parks, state conservancies in existence as of January 1, 2003, urbanized and heavily urbanized local agencies, and community-based organizations within those jurisdictions, to provide outdoor educational opportunities to children.
This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation to establish, on or before March 30, 2016, an Outdoor Environmental Education and Recreation Grants Program with the purpose of increasing the ability of underserved and at-risk populations to participate in outdoor recreation and educational experiences by awarding grants to public organizations, nonprofit organizations, or both.

Each agency and official named in the order shall seal the records in its custody as directed by the order, shall advise the court of its compliance, and, after advising the court, shall seal the copy of the court’s order that was received. The court shall also provide notice to the minor and minor’s counsel that it has ordered the petition dismissed and the records sealed in the case. The notice shall include an advisement of the minor’s right to nondisclosure of the arrest and proceedings, as specified in subdivision (b).
(b) Upon the court’s order of dismissal of the petition, the arrest and other proceedings in the case shall be deemed not to have occurred and the person who was the subject of the petition may reply accordingly to any inquiry by employers, educational institutions, or other persons or entities regarding the arrest and proceedings in the case.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section, satisfactory completion of an informal program of supervision or another term of probation described in subdivision (a) shall be deemed to have occurred if the person has no new findings of wardship or conviction for a felony offense or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude during the period of supervision or probation and if he or she has not failed to substantially comply with the reasonable orders of supervision or probation that are within his or her capacity to perform. The period of supervision or probation shall not be extended solely for the purpose of deferring or delaying eligibility for dismissal of the petition and sealing of the records under this section.
(2) An unfulfilled order or condition of restitution, including a restitution fine that can be converted to a civil judgment under Section 730.6 or an unpaid restitution fee shall not be deemed to constitute unsatisfactory completion of supervision or probation under this section.
(d) A court shall not seal a record or dismiss a petition pursuant to this section if the petition was sustained based on the commission of an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 that was committed when the individual was 14 years of age or older unless the finding on that offense was dismissed or was reduced to a lesser offense that is not listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707.
(e) (1) The court may, in making its order to seal the record and dismiss the instant petition pursuant to this section, include an order to seal a record relating to, or to dismiss, any prior petition or petitions that have been filed or sustained against the individual and that appear to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria otherwise described in this section.
(2) An individual who has a record that is eligible to be sealed under this section may ask the court to order the sealing of a record pertaining to the case that is in the custody of a public agency other than a law enforcement agency, the probation department, or the Department of Justice, and the court may grant the request and order that the public agency record be sealed if the court determines that sealing the additional record will promote the successful reentry and rehabilitation of the individual.
(f) (1) A record that has been ordered sealed by the court under this section may be accessed, inspected, or utilized only under any of the following circumstances:
(A) By the prosecuting attorney, the probation department, or the court for the limited purpose of determining whether the minor is eligible and suitable for deferred entry of judgment pursuant to Section 790 or is ineligible for a program of supervision as defined in Section 654.3.
(B) By the court for the limited purpose of verifying the prior jurisdictional status of a ward who is petitioning the court to resume its jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 388.
(C) If a new petition has been filed against the minor for a felony offense, by the probation department for the limited purpose of identifying the minor’s previous court-ordered programs or placements, and in that event solely to determine the individual’s eligibility or suitability for remedial programs or services. The information obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be disseminated to other agencies or individuals, except as necessary to implement a referral to a remedial program or service, and shall not be used to support the imposition of penalties, detention, or other sanctions upon the minor.
(D) Upon a subsequent adjudication of a minor whose record has been sealed under this section and a finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602 based on the commission of a felony offense, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate juvenile court disposition. Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court’s order dismissing the petition and sealing record in the prior case.
(E) Upon the prosecuting attorney’s motion, made in accordance with Section 707, to initiate court proceedings to determine the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of evaluating and determining the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.

(F) By the person whose record has been sealed, upon his or her request and petition to the court to permit inspection of the records.
(G) The probation department of any county may access the records for the limited purpose of meeting federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E compliance.
(2) Access to, or inspection of, a sealed record authorized by paragraph (1) shall not be deemed an unsealing of the record and shall not require notice to any other agency.
(g) (1) This section does not prohibit a court from enforcing a civil judgment for an unfulfilled order of restitution ordered pursuant to Section 730.6. A minor is not relieved from the obligation to pay victim restitution, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees because the minor’s records are sealed.
(2) A victim or a local collection program may continue to enforce victim restitution orders, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees after a record is sealed. The juvenile court shall have access to any records sealed pursuant to this section for the limited purpose of enforcing a civil judgment or restitution order.
(h) This section does not prohibit the Department of Social Services from meeting its obligations to monitor and conduct periodic evaluations of, and provide reports on, the programs carried under federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E as required by Sections 622, 629 et seq., and 671(a)(7) and (22) of Title 42 of the United States Code, as implemented by federal regulation and state statute.

Under existing law, juvenile court proceedings to declare a minor a ward of the court are commenced by the filing of a petition by the probation officer, the district attorney after consultation with the probation officer, or the prosecuting attorney, as specified. Existing law requires the juvenile court to order the petition of a minor who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court dismissed if the minor satisfactorily completes a term of probation or an informal program of supervision, as specified, and requires the court to seal all records in the custody of the juvenile court pertaining to that dismissed petition, except that the prosecuting attorney and the probation department of any county may have access to the records for the limited purpose of determining whether the minor is eligible for deferred entry of judgment.
This bill would additionally authorize the prosecuting attorney and the probation department to have access to the records for the limited purpose of determining a minor’s eligibility for informal supervision and would authorize the probation department of any county to have access to the records for the limited purpose of meeting federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E compliance. The bill would also authorize the probation department to access the records for the limited purpose of identifying the minor’s previous court-ordered programs or placements, as specified. The bill would also authorize a law enforcement agency, probation department, court, or other local agency that has custody of the sealed record to access the record, as specified.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to protect the interests of Californians who are empowered with the right to vote, it is appropriate that they be duly informed and that their constitutional right to instruct their representatives be protected. This purpose is best served by an informed electorate. The need for greater transparency of advertisement disclosures is vital to the interests of the State such that this act must take effect immediately.","Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing, including requiring the reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures and imposing other reporting and recordkeeping requirements on campaign committees.

The act also requires that an advertisement supporting or opposing a candidate that is paid for by an independent expenditure include a statement that it was not authorized by a candidate or a committee controlled by a candidate.
This bill would require that disclosure statements be printed in no less than 14-point bold, sans serif type font.

The act also requires certain ballot measure advertisements to include a specified disclosure statement if it is paid for by a committee that pays an individual for his or her appearance in the advertisement, as specified.
This bill would repeal a requirement that the disclosure statement appear in roman font.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 84506.5, 84507, and 84511 of the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law exempts specified farm vehicles from registration with the Department of Motor Vehicles if the vehicles have, and display, an identification plate, including a cotton module mover and a vehicle equipped with a water tank that is owned by a farmer and used exclusively to service his or her own implements of husbandry. Existing law exempts a person driving or operating an implement of husbandry over a highway from obtaining a driver’s license, except under specified circumstances.
This bill would, until January 1, 2020, establish a pilot program in specified counties to evaluate an exemption from vehicle registration for specified farm vehicles. The bill would require applicants to meet specified requirements before participating in the pilot program. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of the California Highway Patrol to submit a report to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2018, regarding the pilot program. The bill would require vehicles participating in the program to remain subject to specified fees and requirements. The bill would prohibit a person from operating a vehicle pursuant to the pilot program unless the person has in his or her possession a valid driver’s license for the applicable vehicle type. A violation of these provisions would be punishable as an infraction.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 34501.12 of the Vehicle Code proposed by AB 1960, that would become operative only if this bill and AB 1960 are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 34501.12, 34622, and 36305 of, and to add and repeal Section 36103 of, the Vehicle Code, relating to farm vehicles."

SECTION 1.
Section 6601 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
6601.
(a) (1) Whenever the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determines that an individual who is in custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and who is either serving a determinate prison sentence or whose parole has been revoked, may be a sexually violent predator, the secretary shall, at least six months prior to that individual’s scheduled date for release from prison, refer the person for evaluation in accordance with this section. However, if the inmate was received by the department with less than nine months of his or her sentence to serve, or if the inmate’s release date is modified by judicial or administrative action, the secretary may refer the person for evaluation in accordance with this section at a date that is less than six months prior to the inmate’s scheduled release date.
(2) A petition may be filed under this section if the individual was in custody pursuant to his or her determinate prison term, parole revocation term, or a hold placed pursuant to Section 6601.3, at the time the petition is filed. A petition shall not be dismissed on the basis of a later judicial or administrative determination that the individual’s custody was unlawful, if the unlawful custody was the result of a good faith mistake of fact or law. This paragraph shall apply to any petition filed on or after January 1, 1996.
(b) The person shall be screened by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Board of Parole Hearings based on whether the person has committed a sexually violent predatory offense and on a review of the person’s social, criminal, and institutional history. This screening shall be conducted in accordance with a structured screening instrument developed and updated by the State Department of State Hospitals in consultation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. If as a result of this screening it is determined that the person is likely to be a sexually violent predator, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall refer the person to the State Department of State Hospitals for a full evaluation of whether the person meets the criteria in Section 6600.
(c)
(1)
The State Department of State Hospitals shall evaluate the person in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol, developed and updated by the State Department of State Hospitals, to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator as defined in this article. The standardized assessment protocol shall require assessment of diagnosable mental disorders, as well as various factors known to be associated with the risk of reoffense among sex offenders. Risk factors to be considered shall include criminal and psychosexual history, type, degree, and duration of sexual deviance, and severity of mental disorder.
(2) On or before January 30, 2016, the State Department of State Hospitals shall consult with a committee consisting of one representative from each of the State Department of State Hospitals, the California District Attorneys Association, the California Public Defenders Association, and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office. The committee members shall select a member of the private defense bar and a person with experience as an evaluator under Article 4 (commencing with Section 6600) of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of Division 6 to make recommendations regarding possible changes to the standardized assessment protocol, as described in paragraph (3).

The regulations shall also include requirements and procedures for training evaluators.
(d) Pursuant to subdivision (c), the person shall be evaluated by two practicing psychiatrists or psychologists, or one practicing psychiatrist and one practicing psychologist, designated by the Director of State Hospitals. If both evaluators concur that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody, the Director of State Hospitals shall forward a request for a petition for commitment under Section 6602 to the county designated in subdivision (i). Copies of the evaluation reports and any other supporting documents shall be made available to the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) who may file a petition for commitment.
(e) If one of the professionals performing the evaluation pursuant to subdivision (d) does not concur that the person meets the criteria specified in subdivision (d), but the other professional concludes that the person meets those criteria, the Director of State Hospitals shall arrange for further examination of the person by two independent professionals selected in accordance with subdivision (g).
(f) If an examination by independent professionals pursuant to subdivision (e) is conducted, a petition to request commitment under this article shall only be filed if both independent professionals who evaluate the person pursuant to subdivision (e) concur that the person meets the criteria for commitment specified in subdivision (d). The professionals selected to evaluate the person pursuant to subdivision (g) shall inform the person that the purpose of their examination is not treatment but to determine if the person meets certain criteria to be involuntarily committed pursuant to this article. It is not required that the person appreciate or understand that information.
(g) Any independent professional who is designated by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of State Hospitals for purposes of this section shall not be a state government employee, shall have at least five years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, and shall include psychiatrists and licensed psychologists who have a doctoral degree in psychology. The requirements set forth in this section also shall apply to any professionals appointed by the court to evaluate the person for purposes of any other proceedings under this article.
(h) If the State Department of State Hospitals determines that the person is a sexually violent predator as defined in this article, the Director of State Hospitals shall forward a request for a petition to be filed for commitment under this article to the county designated in subdivision (i). Copies of the evaluation reports and any other supporting documents shall be made available to the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) who may file a petition for commitment in the superior court.
(i) If the county’s designated counsel concurs with the recommendation, a petition for commitment shall be filed in the superior court of the county in which the person was convicted of the offense for which he or she was committed to the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The petition shall be filed, and the proceedings shall be handled, by either the district attorney or the county counsel of that county. The county board of supervisors shall designate either the district attorney or the county counsel to assume responsibility for proceedings under this article.
(j) The time limits set forth in this section shall not apply during the first year that this article is operative.
(k) An order issued by a judge pursuant to Section 6601.5, finding that the petition, on its face, supports a finding of probable cause to believe that the individual named in the petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release, shall toll that person’s parole pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 3000 of the Penal Code, if that individual is determined to be a sexually violent predator.
(l) Pursuant to subdivision (d), the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) shall notify the State Department of State Hospitals of its decision regarding the filing of a petition for commitment within 15 days of making that decision.
(m) This section shall become operative on the date that the director executes a declaration, which shall be provided to the fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature, including the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, and the Department of Finance, specifying that sufficient qualified state employees have been hired to conduct the evaluations required pursuant to subdivision (d), or January 1, 2013, whichever occurs first.

6604.9.
(a) A person found to be a sexually violent predator and committed to the custody of the State Department of State Hospitals shall have a current examination of his or her mental condition made at least once every year. The report shall be in the form of a declaration and shall be prepared by a professionally qualified person. The report shall also be signed by the Director of the State Department of State Hospitals. The person may retain or, if he or she is indigent and so requests, the court may appoint, a qualified expert or professional person to examine him or her, and the expert or professional person shall have access to all records concerning the person.
(b) The annual report shall include consideration of whether the committed person currently meets the definition of a sexually violent predator and whether conditional release to a less restrictive alternative, pursuant to Section 6608, or an unconditional discharge, pursuant to Section 6605, is in the best interest of the person and conditions can be imposed that would adequately protect the community.
(c) The State Department of State Hospitals shall file this periodic report with the court that committed the person under this article. A copy of the report shall be served on the prosecuting agency involved in the initial commitment and upon the committed person.
(d) If the State Department of State Hospitals determines that either: (1) the person’s condition has so changed that the person no longer meets the definition of a sexually violent predator and should, therefore, be considered for unconditional discharge, or (2) conditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the person and conditions can be imposed that adequately protect the community, the director shall authorize the person to petition the court for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative or for an unconditional discharge. The petition shall be filed with the court and served upon the prosecuting agency responsible for the initial commitment.
(e) The court, upon receipt of the petition for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative, shall consider the petition using procedures described in Section 6608.
(f) The court, upon receiving a petition for unconditional discharge, shall order a show cause hearing, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6605, at which the court may consider the petition and any accompanying documentation provided by the medical director, the prosecuting attorney, or the committed person.
SEC. 3.

SEC. 2.
Section 14581 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:

(ii) If the amount estimated to be necessary for the current calendar year, as specified in clause (i), is less than the amount estimated to be necessary for the previous calendar year, the department shall calculate the amount of that difference.
(iii) The department shall expend an amount that is not greater than 50 percent of the amount calculated pursuant to clause (ii) for purposes of subparagraph (B).
(iv) If the department determines that the amount of funds authorized for expenditure pursuant to this subparagraph is not needed to make plastic market development payments pursuant to subparagraph (B) in the calendar year for which that amount is allocated, the department may expend those funds during the following year.
(v) If the department determines that there are insufficient funds to both make the market development payments pursuant to subparagraph (B) and to deposit the amount required by clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (5), for purposes of making the processing payments and reducing the processing fees pursuant to Section 14575 for plastic beverage containers, the department shall suspend the implementation of this subparagraph and subparagraph (B).

(d) Before making an expenditure pursuant to paragraph (6) of subdivision (a), the department shall convene an advisory committee consisting of representatives of the beverage industry, beverage container manufacturers, environmental organizations, the recycling industry, nonprofit organizations, and retailers to advise the department on the most cost-effective and efficient method of the expenditure of the funds for that education and information campaign.
(e) Subject to the availability of funds, the department shall retroactively pay in full any payments provided in this section that have been proportionally reduced during the period of January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010.","Existing law, the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act, requires a distributor to pay a redemption payment for every beverage container sold or offered for sale in the state by the distributor to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery for deposit in the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department for certain payments, including market development payments. Existing law authorizes the department, until that authorization is repealed on January 1, 2017, to (1) annually expend up to $10,000,000 from the fund to make market development payments to an entity certified by the department as a recycling center, processor, or dropoff or collection program for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and made usable for the manufacture of a plastic product, or to a product manufacturer for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and used by that product manufacturer to manufacture a product, and to (2) expend additional amounts to make market development payments, calculated as provided.
This bill would postpone that repeal until January 1, 2018. By extending the term of a continuous appropriation, this bill would make an appropriation.","An act to amend Sections 14549.2 and 14581 of the Public Resources Code, relating to beverage containers, and making an appropriation therefor."

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state, and requires and authorizes local educational agencies to provide specified instruction at elementary and secondary schools. Existing law prescribes various requirements with respect to a course of study for grades 7 to 12, inclusive, at these schools.
This bill, commencing with the 2016–17 school year, would prohibit school districts that maintain any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school, as defined to exclude alternative schools, community day schools, continuation schools, and opportunity schools, in the school district to any course period without educational content, as defined, for more than one week in any semester, except under prescribed conditions. The bill would specifically prohibit school districts from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school in the school district to a course period without educational content because there are not sufficient curricular course offerings for the pupil to take during the relevant period of the designated schoolday.
The bill would, commencing with the 2016–17 school year, also prohibit school districts that maintain any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, from assigning a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school, as defined to exclude alternative schools, community day schools, continuation schools, and opportunity schools, in the school district, to a course that the pupil has previously completed and received a grade determined by the school district to be sufficient to satisfy the requirements and prerequisites for admission to the California public institutions of postsecondary education and the minimum requirements for receiving a diploma of graduation from high school, except under specified conditions.
The bill would specify that it is not to be interpreted to limit or otherwise affect the authority of a school district to authorize dual enrollment in community college or to provide evening high school programs, independent study programs, or work-based learning or work experience education.
The bill would specify procedures to be followed if a complaint of noncompliance with the requirements of the bill is filed with a local educational agency or if an appeal of the local educational agency’s decision on the complaint is made to the State Department of Education. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to prepare an annual report detailing actions taken pursuant to these procedures.
The bill would require the Superintendent to develop regulations for adoption by the State Board of Education governing these provisions.
To the extent that this bill would create new duties for local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Sections 51228.1, 51228.2, and 51228.3 to the Education Code, relating to pupil instruction."

(3) An economic impact assessment prepared pursuant to this subdivision for a proposed regulation that is not a major regulation or that is a major regulation proposed prior to November 1, 2013, shall be prepared in accordance with subdivision (b), and shall be included in the initial statement of reasons as required by Section 11346.2. An economic assessment prepared pursuant to this subdivision for a major regulation proposed on or after November 1, 2013, shall be prepared in accordance with subdivision (c), and shall be included in the initial statement of reasons as required by Section 11346.2.
(b) (1) A state agency proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation that is not a major regulation or that is a major regulation proposed prior to November 1, 2013, shall prepare an economic impact assessment that assesses whether and to what extent it will affect the following:

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) With the enactment of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Division 30 (commencing with Section 40000) of the Public Resources Code), the Legislature declared that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery and local agencies shall promote composting.
(b) Since the enactment of the act, local governments and private industries have worked jointly to create an extensive material collection infrastructure and have implemented effective programs to achieve a statewide diversion rate greater than 50 percent.
(c) Although California now leads the nation in waste reduction and recycling, the state continues to dispose of more than 15 million tons of compostable organics each year in solid waste landfills.
(d) Composting organic materials results in substantial environmental and agricultural benefits, including the reduction of naturally occurring volatile organic compounds and ammonia.
(e) The Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee, formed pursuant to the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code), has identified composting as a cost-effective technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
(f) The application of compost in agriculture and landscaping has been shown to offer significant soil-carbon sequestration and water quality benefits, provide erosion control, reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and conserve water and irrigation-associated energy.
(g) In 2007, the department’s predecessor agency adopted Strategic Directive 6.1 to reduce the amount of organics in the waste stream by 50 percent by the year 2020.
(h) In 2014, the state required organic waste generators that produce four cubic yards or more of organic waste a week to arrange to recycle this material (Chapter 12.9 (commencing with Section 42649.8) of the Public Resources Code).
(i) To reduce the amount of organics in landfills, the state must promote the development and permitting of composting facilities and ensure that state regulations account for the lifecycle emissions reduction and water quality benefits of compost, while continuing to protect air and water quality.
SEC. 2.
Section 42649.87 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
42649.87.
(a) The California Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, and the Department of Food and Agriculture, shall develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the use of agricultural, forestry, and urban organic waste as a feedstock for compost and by promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state.
(b) In developing policies pursuant to subdivision (a), the California Environmental Protection Agency shall promote a goal of reducing at least five million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands, which include, but are not limited to, agricultural land, land used for forestry, and rangeland. The California Environmental Protection Agency shall work with the Department of Food and Agriculture to achieve this goal.
(c) The California Secretary for Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture shall ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement this section. The California Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board shall do all of the following:
(1) Assess the state’s progress towards developing the organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure necessary to meet the state goals specified in Assembly Bill 341 (Chapter 476 of the Statutes of 2011), Assembly Bill 1826 (Chapter 727 of the Statutes of 2014), the State Air Resources Board’s May 2015 Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy concept paper, and the Department of Food and Agriculture’s Healthy Soils Initiative.
(2) Meet at least quarterly and consult with interested stakeholders, including, but not limited to, the compost industry, local governments, and environmental organizations, to encourage the continued viability of the state’s organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure.
(3) Hold at least one public workshop annually to inform the public of actions taken to implement this section and to receive public comment.
(4) Develop recommendations for promoting organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide, which shall be posted on the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Internet Web site no later than January 1, 2017, and updated annually thereafter.
(d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 3.
Section 43032 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
43032.
(a) The department, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board and the State Water Resources Control Board, shall develop a policy that promotes the development of coordinated permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.","(1) The existing California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which is administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, establishes an integrated waste management program. Existing law requires each city, county, city and county, and regional agency, if any, to develop a source reduction and recycling element of an integrated waste management plan. Those entities are required to divert 50% of all solid waste through source reduction, recycling, and composting.
This bill would require the California Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, and the Department of Food and Agriculture, to develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the composting of specified organic waste and by promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state. The bill would require the agency to promote a goal of reducing at least 5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands, and would require the agency to work with the Department of Food and Agriculture to achieve this goal. The bill would also require the Secretary for Environmental Protection and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement these requirements and would require the agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board, to perform other specified functions. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to adopt regulations relating to waste management, including standards for the design, operation, maintenance, and ultimate reuse of solid waste facilities, and for solid waste handling, transfer, composting, transformation, and disposal. Existing law prohibits the solid waste handling, transfer, composting, transformation, and disposal standards from including any requirement that is under the authority of the State Air Resources Board for the prevention of air pollution or the State Water Resources Control Board for the prevention of water pollution and prohibits the solid waste facilities standards from including aspects of solid waste handling and disposal that are within the jurisdiction of the State Air Resources Board, air pollution control districts, and air quality management districts, or the State Water Resources Control Board or a regional water district.
Existing law prohibits a person from discharging a quantity of air contaminants or other material that causes injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to the public, or that endangers the comfort, repose, health, or safety of the public, or that causes injury or damage to business or property, except as provided.
Under existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal state agencies with responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality in the state. The act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee.
This bill would require, until January 1, 2021, the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board and the State Water Resources Control Board, to develop a policy that promotes the development of coordinated permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment.","An act to add and repeal Sections 42649.87 and 43032 to the Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste."

(c) In an appropriate action, a court may find that more than two persons with a claim to parentage under this division are parents if the court finds that recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child. In determining detriment to the child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the harm of removing the child from a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and the child’s psychological needs for care and affection, and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time. A finding of detriment to the child does not require a finding of unfitness of any of the parents or persons with a claim to parentage.
(d) Unless a court orders otherwise after making the determination specified in subdivision (c), a presumption under Section 7611 is rebutted by a judgment establishing parentage of the child by another person.
(e) Within two years of the execution of a voluntary declaration of paternity, a person who is presumed to be a parent under Section 7611 may file a petition pursuant to Section 7630 to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity. The court’s ruling on the petition to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity shall be made taking into account the validity of the voluntary declaration of paternity, and the best interests of the child based upon the court’s consideration of the factors set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 7575, as well as the best interests of the child based upon the nature, duration, and quality of the petitioning party’s relationship with the child and the benefit or detriment to the child of continuing that relationship. In the event of any conflict between the presumption under Section 7611 and the voluntary declaration of paternity, the weightier considerations of policy and logic shall control.
(f) A voluntary declaration of paternity is invalid if, at the time the declaration was signed, any of the following conditions exist:
(1) The child already had a presumed parent under Section 7540.
(2) The child already had a presumed parent under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 7611.
(3) The man signing the declaration is a sperm donor, consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 7613.
(g) A person’s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative, as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights.

Existing law also provides that if a man signs a voluntary declaration of paternity, it has the force and effect of a judgment of paternity, subject to certain exceptions. Existing law provides that these presumptions are rebuttable.
This bill would state that a person’s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights.
Existing law requires a nonattorney surrogacy facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds in an independent, bonded escrow account or a trust account maintained by an attorney, subject to specified withdrawal requirements.
This bill would additionally require a nonattorney donor facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds, as specified above.","An act to amend Sections 7612, 7960, and 7961 of, and to amend the heading of Part 7 (commencing with Section 7960) of Division 12 of, the Family Code, relating to children."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Almost 50 percent of clinical trial studies are not finished in time due to low patient participation, recruitment and navigation difficulties, and other barriers for patients. Due to economic and socioeconomic circumstances and lack of patient knowledge, clinical oncology trial participation and retention are both very low as they relate to eligible participants.
(b) Overall, only 3 percent of eligible cancer patients participate in clinical trials, and of those only 5 percent of trial participants are from racial or ethnic minority communities.
(c) One barrier that prevents patients from participating in federal Food and Drug Administration clinical trials is finances. Patients of low to moderate income are often unable to bear the burden of the ancillary costs of participating, such as airfare, lodging, rental cars, and fuel.
(d) The American Medical Association conducted a study on cancer trial participation. The study found that from 1996 to 2002, of the 75,215 patients enrolled in the National Cancer Institute trials for breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers, only 3.1 percent were Hispanic, 9.2 percent were Black, and 1.9 percent were Asian or Pacific Islanders, while 85.6 percent were White. This lack of diversity is of concern because of its impact on researchers’ ability to evaluate the effect of new treatments on different populations. It also speaks to a lack of access to potentially lifesaving trials for a large portion of the population.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish a program to enable willing patients of low to moderate income to participate in cancer clinical trials in order to boost participation rates, ensure these trials are widely accessible, improve the development of cancer therapies, and enhance innovation.

Existing law also establishes the Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research Act, which is designed to promote the inclusion of women and minority groups in clinical research, including clinical trials.
This bill, until January 1, 2022, would establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation in the Health and Human Services Agency, to be governed by a board of trustees. Members of the board would be appointed as specified. The bill would also create the Cancer Clinical Trials Fund, to be used to administer a grant program. The bill would limit the amount the agency may spend to establish the foundation to $300,000 of appropriated funds, to be repaid by January 1, 2021, but would otherwise prohibit General Fund moneys from being used for the foundation. The bill would authorize the board to solicit and receive money, as specified, and would authorize the agency to apply for federal funds for this purpose. The bill would require the board, upon contribution of at least $500,000 to the fund, to establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program, in order to increase patient access to cancer clinical trials in specified populations.

Section 554 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
554.
(a) Sections 551 and 552 do not apply to cases of emergency or to work performed in the protection of life or property from loss or destruction, or to any common carrier engaged in or connected with the movement of trains. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent an accumulation of days of rest when the nature of the employment reasonably requires that the employee work seven or more consecutive days, if in each calendar month the employee receives days of rest equivalent to one day’s rest in seven. The requirement respecting the equivalent of one day’s rest in seven shall apply, notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter relating to collective bargaining agreements, where the employer and a labor organization representing employees of the employer have entered into a valid collective bargaining agreement respecting the hours of work of the employees, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise.
(b) In addition to the exceptions specified in subdivision (a), the Chief of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement may, when in his or her judgment hardship will result, exempt any employer or employees from the provisions of Sections 551 and 552.

Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 857) is added to Part 2 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, to read:
CHAPTER  6. Agriculture
857.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Phase-In Overtime for Agricultural Workers Act of 2016.
858.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Agricultural employees engage in back-breaking work every day.
(b) Few occupations in today’s America are as physically demanding and exhausting as agricultural work.
(c) In 1938, the United States Congress enacted the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), which excluded agricultural workers from wage protections and overtime compensation requirements.
(d) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact the Phase-In Overtime for Agricultural Workers Act of 2016 to provide any person employed in an agricultural occupation in California, as defined in Order No. 14-2001 of the Industrial Welfare Commission (revised 07-2014) with an opportunity to earn overtime compensation under the same standards as millions of other Californians.
859.
For purposes of this chapter, “employed in an agricultural occupation” has the same meaning as in Order No.14-2001 of the Industrial Welfare Commission (revised 07-2014).
860.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 500):
(a) (1) Commencing January 1, 2019, except as provided in paragraph (2), any person employed in an agricultural occupation shall not be employed more than nine and one-half hours in any one workday or work in excess of 55 hours in any one workweek, unless the employee receives one and one-half times that employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over nine and one-half hours in any workday or over 55 hours in any workweek.
(2) This subdivision shall apply to an employer who employs 25 or fewer employees commencing January 1, 2022.
(b) (1) Commencing January 1, 2020, except as provided in paragraph (2), any person employed in an agricultural occupation shall not be employed more than nine hours in any one workday or work in excess of 50 hours in any one workweek, unless the employee receives one and one-half times that employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over nine hours in any workday or over 50 hours in any workweek.
(2) This subdivision shall apply to an employer who employs 25 or fewer employees commencing January 1, 2023.
(c) (1) Commencing January 1, 2021, except as provided in paragraph (2), any person employed in an agricultural occupation shall not be employed more than eight and one-half hours in any one workday or work in excess of 45 hours in any one workweek, unless the employee receives one and one-half times that employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight and one-half hours in any workday or over 45 hours in any workweek.
(2) This subdivision shall apply to an employer who employs 25 or fewer employees commencing January 1, 2024.
(d) (1) Commencing January 1, 2022, except as provided in paragraph (2), any person employed in an agricultural occupation shall not be employed more than eight hours in any one workday or work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek, unless the employee receives one and one-half times that employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight hours in any workday or over 40 hours in any workweek.
(2) This subdivision shall apply to an employer who employs 25 or fewer employees commencing January 1, 2025.
861.
Except as set forth in Section 860 and subdivision (a) of Section 862, all other provisions of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 500) regarding compensation for overtime work shall apply to workers in an agricultural occupation commencing January 1, 2017.
862.
(a) Beginning January 1, 2022, except as provided in subdivision (c), and consistent with Section 510, any work performed by a person, employed in an agricultural occupation, in excess of 12 hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the employee’s regular rate of pay.
(b) Consistent with Section 861, notwithstanding subdivision (a) or Section 863, the other provisions of Section 510 shall be applicable to workers in an agricultural occupation commencing January 1, 2019.
(c) Subdivision (a) shall apply to an employer who employs 25 or fewer employees commencing January 1, 2025.
863.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 860 or 862, the Governor may temporarily suspend scheduled phase in of the overtime requirements set forth in Section 860, or subdivision (a) of Section 862 only if the Governor suspends scheduled minimum wage increases pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of, and subparagraph (B) of, paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 1182.12.
(b) If the Governor makes a final determination to temporarily suspend scheduled phase in of the overtime requirements set forth in Section 860 or subdivision (a) of Section 862 for the following year, all implementation dates applicable to Section 860 and subdivision (a) of Section 862 that are suspended subsequent to the September 1 final determination date, consistent with clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of, and subparagraph (B) of, paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 1182.12, shall be postponed by an additional year, but the full implementation of the overtime requirements set forth in Section 860 or subdivision (a) of Section 862 shall in no event be later than January 1, 2022. The Governor’s temporary suspension under this section shall be by proclamation.
(c) The Governor’s authority to suspend the scheduled overtime requirements under this section shall end upon the phase in of the overtime requirements contained in subdivision (d) of Section 860, the phase in of the overtime requirements contained in subdivision (c) of Section 862, or January 1, 2025, whichever occurs first.
864.
The Department of Industrial Relations shall update Wage Order No. 14-2001 to be consistent with this chapter, except that any existing provision in Wage Order 14-2001 providing greater protections or benefits to agricultural employees shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding any provision of this chapter.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law sets wage, hour, meal break requirements, and other working conditions for employees and requires an employer to pay overtime wages as specified to an employee who works in excess of a workday or workweek, as defined, and imposes criminal penalties for the violation of these requirements. Existing law exempts agricultural employees from these requirements. Under existing law, the function of the Department of Industrial Relations is to, among other things, foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners of California, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
This bill would remove the exemption for agricultural employees regarding hours, meal breaks, and other working conditions, including specified wage requirements, and would create a schedule that would phase in overtime requirements for agricultural workers, as defined, over the course of 4 years, from 2019 to 2022, inclusive. Beginning January 1, 2022, the bill would require any work performed by a person, employed in an agricultural occupation, in excess of 12 hours in one day to be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the employee’s regular rate of pay. The bill would provide employers who employ 25 or fewer employees an additional 3 years to comply with the phasing in of these overtime requirements. The bill would authorize the Governor to delay the implementation of these overtime pay provisions if the Governor also suspends the implementation of a scheduled state minimum wage increase, as specified. The bill would require the Department of Industrial Relations to update a specified wage order for consistency with these provisions, as specified.
The bill would create a state-mandated local program by including agricultural employees as a class of employees protected by criminal penalties under existing law.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 554 of, and to add Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 857) to Part 2 of Division 2 of, the Labor Code, relating to employment."
711,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Priority Project Parity Act of 2015.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code), commonly known as CEQA, was enacted with a near unanimous bipartisan vote of the Legislature in 1970 and signed into law by Governor Reagan.
(b) The purpose of CEQA is to enhance public disclosure of the environmental impacts of a project and to require feasible mitigation measures or alternative project configurations that reduce significant adverse impacts to the physical environment.
(c) Feasible mitigation measures and alternatives are limited to those that allow the project to achieve its objectives, fall within the jurisdiction of the lead agency, and can be readily implemented from a legal, technical, and economic perspective.
(d) If, notwithstanding the feasible mitigation measures or alternative configuration, a project would have a significant unavoidable adverse impact on the physical environment or substantially contribute to an unavoidable significant adverse cumulative impact on the physical environment, an agency may nevertheless approve the project by adopting a statement explaining the overriding employment, environmental, social, economic, or other benefits that have informed the agency’s decision to approve the project.
(e) In a notable contrast to the federal court interpretation of the federal National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. Secs. 4321 et seq.), which served as a model for CEQA, California courts have decided that lawsuits challenging the adequacy of an agency’s compliance with CEQA may be brought by any party for any reason, including, but not limited to, parties seeking competitive advantage, seeking wage or other employment terms and conditions, seeking to protect private property economic values, and seeking to preclude neighborhood-scale projects that are or may increase the quality of life for lower income and racially diverse population groups, by increasing youth utilization of urban parks or by developing transit systems in urbanized areas, without regard to the environmental or other merits of the project.
(f) In advising the state, regional, and local agency on the compliance requirements of CEQA, the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research has identified more than 100 potential environmental impact topics that must be evaluated for each project, has routinely adopted guidance that increases the cost and complexity of the analysis required, and continues to propose requirements that increase uncertainty and complexity, including, but not limited to, advocating for regulatory reversals of appellate court statutory interpretations, such as the “business as usual” approach to evaluating the significance of greenhouse gas emissions and the judicial classification of parking as an environmental impact based on air quality and other factors. Collectively, such ambiguous and contradictory advice has continued to increase the cost and litigation uncertainty of compliance obligations under CEQA.
(g) Three private sector law firms, each representing a diverse range of parties affected by CEQA including public agencies, project applicants, and other stakeholders, have completed studies on reported appellate court decisions interpreting CEQA and those studies demonstrate that the courts have determined that the lead agencies failed to comply with some aspect of CEQA in nearly half of all cases, and that even the most elaborate environmental studies, the environmental impact reports, that are entitled to the highest level of judicial deference, failed to pass judicial muster in nearly half of all reported appellate cases over a 15-year period. Projects approved under a less costly and less time-consuming negative declaration process fail to pass judicial muster in far more than half of the cases challenging those approvals.
(h) The overwhelming majority of the adverse court decisions required that project approval be vacated pending completion of further environmental studies under CEQA.
(i) Notwithstanding such conclusive evidence of widespread confusion regarding the compliance requirements of CEQA, along with litigation abuse to promote nonenvironmental interests and abusive litigation tactics, such as “document dumping,” to delay agency decisions for weeks and sometimes months after the close of the comment periods prescribed by CEQA, the Legislature has declined to enact any systematic reforms that address how this 1970-era law is to be interpreted in conjunction with the hundreds of environmental and planning mandates that have subsequently been enacted as coequal legal mandates in California’s stringent and complex suite of statutes designed to protect and enhance environmental quality, including, but not limited to, statutes requiring integration of environmental protection standards in land use plans and policies.
(j) The existence of an outstanding lawsuit challenging compliance with CEQA, in tandem with the high level of adverse judicial outcomes, creates significant unresolved project contingencies that generally preclude timely receipt of federal and state grant funding as well as other forms of public and private sector financing.
(k) Legislative leadership has routinely sponsored last minute legislation for politically favored projects, including, but not limited to, major league sports facilities and prisons, to either exempt them from CEQA or limit the judicial remedies that are available when an adverse judicial determination has been made. These favored leadership projects have achieved this sheltered status without regard to whether the projects are consistent with an adopted sustainable communities strategy required pursuant to Section 65080 of the Government Code. This highly politicized leadership exemption process has been referred to as the “transactional” model for implementing CEQA.
(l) This transactional model for implementing CEQA is an effective method of avoiding delays in financing and implementation of priority projects. There is an ample body of otherwise applicable California environmental protection and land use law in place to avoid and minimize potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to the physical environment without regard to the applicability of CEQA. No existing law creates a presumed different suite of legal compliance obligations reserved to legislative leaders and the legislative districts they represent. Legislative leadership positions do not confer upon individuals serving in those positions a monopoly on the use of the transactional model for implementing CEQA. The transactional model of legislative exemptions has a history of extending nearly to the 1970 enactment date of CEQA.
(m) It is now appropriate to enact a new compliance pathway for a project identified as a priority by each Member of the Senate and Assembly.
SEC. 3.
Section 21168.10 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
21168.10.
(a) (1) On or before November 15 of each year, each Member of the Legislature may annually nominate one project within his or her respective district as a priority project.
(2) A member of the Legislature who chooses to nominate a project shall submit to the Governor the name of the project and sufficient information to demonstrate that the project will meet the requirements specified in paragraph (3).
(3) The Governor shall designate a project as a priority project if the project meets all of the following:
(A) The project will result in at least 100 new or retained full time jobs.
(B) The project is consistent with the adopted sustainable communities strategy for the region in which the project is located.
(C) The project applicant certifies its intent to remain in the location of the project for a minimum of five years.
(b) Subject to subdivision (a), a project may be designated as a priority project pursuant to subdivision (a) at any time following the submittal of the project proposal or application to the lead agency for the commencement of environmental review pursuant to this division but not later than 30 days following the approval of the project by the lead agency.
(c) Withing 10 days after the designation of a project pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), the Governor shall provide a notice of designation to the lead agency for the designated project and to the Office of Planning and Research. The lead agency shall inform members of the public and other interested stakeholders that a project has been designated as a priority project pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) in the lead agency’s next otherwise applicable and required public document or notice regarding the project and in all subsequent otherwise applicable and required public documents or notices regarding the project, up to and including applicable and required notice and documentation for project approval. If there is no applicable and required public document or notice, the lead agency shall provide a notice of designation to the public and interested stakeholders.
(d) (1) The lead agency for a priority project shall complete all notices required by this division and, except as provided in paragraph (3), an environmental impact report shall be completed for each priority project.
(2) The environmental impact report for a priority project may tier from an earlier environmental impact report completed for the existing or earlier version of the project and the tiered environmental impact report shall be limited to the consideration of significant adverse impacts resulting from the project that were not previously identified in the earlier environmental impact report, or, if the adverse impacts had been identified in the earlier environmental impact report, the impacts are more severe than previously identified.
(3) A new environmental impact report is not required for a priority project that has been already included in an environmental impact report prepared and certified under this division but the lead agency shall prepare an addendum to the prior environmental impact report to explain to the public and other interested stakeholders the manner in which the project had been addressed in the prior environmental impact report.
(e) (1) In granting relief in an action or proceeding brought pursuant to this division, the court shall not stay or enjoin a priority project designated pursuant to subdivision (a) unless the court finds either of the following:
(A) The continued implementation of the priority project presents an imminent threat to the public health and safety.
(B) The priority project site contains unforeseen important Native American artifacts or unforeseen important historical, archaeological, or ecological values that would be materially, permanently, and adversely affected by the continued implementation of the priority project.
(2) If the court finds that subparagraph (A) or (B) is satisfied, the court shall only enjoin those specific activities associated with the priority project that present an imminent threat to public health and safety or that materially, permanently, and adversely affect unforeseen important Native American artifacts or unforeseen important historical, archaeological, or ecological values.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.
CEQA establishes procedures by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and the judicial remedies available.
This bill would authorize each Member of the Legislature to nominate one project within his or her respective district each year, and the Governor to designate those projects as priority projects if the projects meet specified requirements. The bill would require the Governor to provide a notice of the designation to the appropriate lead agency and to the Office of Planning and Research. The bill would require the lead agency to notify the public and interested stakeholders of the designation, as specified, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. The bill would require that an environmental impact report be prepared for each priority project, but would authorize tiering from previously prepared reports, as specified. The bill would prohibit the court from staying or enjoining the implementation of a priority project unless the court makes specified findings and would limit any stay or injunction, as provided.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 21168.10 to the Public Resources Code, relating to the environment."

(2) The medication shall not have been adulterated, misbranded, or stored under conditions contrary to standards set by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) or the product manufacturer.
(3) The medication shall not have been in the possession of a patient or any individual member of the public, and in the case of medications donated by a health or care facility, as described in Section 150202, shall have been under the control of a staff member of the health or care facility who is licensed in California as a health care professional or has completed, at a minimum, the training requirements specified in Section 1569.69.
(d) (1) Only medication that is donated in unopened, tamper-evident packaging or modified unit dose containers that meet USP standards is eligible for donation to the repository and distribution program, provided lot numbers and expiration dates are affixed. Medication donated in opened containers shall not be dispensed by the repository and distribution program, and once identified, shall be quarantined immediately and handled and disposed of in accordance with the Medical Waste Management Act (Part 14 (commencing with Section 117600) of Division 104).
(2) (A) A medication that is the subject of a United States Food and Drug Administration managed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy pursuant to Section 355-1 of Title 21 of the United States Code shall not be donated if this inventory transfer is prohibited by that strategy, or if the inventory transfer requires prior authorization from the manufacturer of the medication.
(B) A medication that is the subject of a United States Food and Drug Administration managed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy pursuant to Section 355-1 of Title 21 of the United States Code, the donation of which is not prohibited pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall be managed and dispensed according to the requirements of that strategy.
(e) A pharmacist or physician at a participating entity shall use his or her professional judgment in determining whether donated medication meets the standards of this division before accepting or dispensing any medication under the repository and distribution program.
(f) A pharmacist or physician shall adhere to standard pharmacy practices, as required by state and federal law, when dispensing all medications.
(g) Medication that is donated to the repository and distribution program shall be handled in the following ways:
(1) Dispensed to an eligible patient.
(2) Destroyed.
(3) Returned to a reverse distributor or licensed waste hauler.
(4) (A) Transferred to another participating entity within the county to be dispensed to eligible patients pursuant to this division. Notwithstanding this paragraph, a participating county-owned pharmacy may transfer eligible donated medication to a participating county-owned pharmacy within another adjacent county that has adopted a program pursuant to this division, if the pharmacies transferring the medication have a written agreement between the entities that outlines protocols and procedures for safe and appropriate drug transfer that are consistent with this division.
(B) Medication donated under this division shall not be transferred by any participating entity more than once, and after it has been transferred, shall be dispensed to an eligible patient, destroyed, or returned to a reverse distributor or licensed waste hauler.
(C) Medication transferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred with documentation that identifies the drug name, strength, and quantity of the medication, and the donation facility from where the medication originated shall be identified on medication packaging or in accompanying documentation. The document shall include a statement that the medication may not be transferred to another participating entity and must be handled pursuant to subparagraph (B). A copy of this document shall be kept by the participating entity transferring the medication and the participating entity receiving the medication.
(h) Medication that is donated to the repository and distribution program that does not meet the requirements of this division shall not be distributed or transferred under this program and shall be either destroyed or returned to a reverse distributor. Donated medication that does not meet the requirements of this division shall not be sold, dispensed, or otherwise transferred to any other entity.
(i) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), medication donated to the repository and distribution program shall be maintained in the donated packaging units until dispensed to an eligible patient under this program, who presents a valid prescription. When dispensed to an eligible patient under this program, the medication shall be in a new and properly labeled container, specific to the eligible patient and ensuring the privacy of the individuals for whom the medication was initially dispensed. Expired medication shall not be dispensed.
(2) A pharmacy that exists solely to operate the repository and distribution program may repackage a reasonable quantity of donated medicine in anticipation of dispensing the medicine to its patient population. The pharmacy shall have repackaging policies and procedures in place for identifying and recalling medications. Medication that is repackaged shall be labeled with the earliest expiration date.
(j) Medication donated to the repository and distribution program shall be segregated from the participating entity’s other drug stock by physical means, for purposes including, but not limited to, inventory, accounting, and inspection.
(k) A participating entity shall keep complete records of the acquisition and disposition of medication donated to, and transferred, dispensed, and destroyed under, the repository and distribution program. These records shall be kept separate from the participating entity’s other acquisition and disposition records and shall conform to the Pharmacy Law (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 4000) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code), including being readily retrievable.
(l) Local and county protocols established pursuant to this division shall conform to the Pharmacy Law regarding packaging, transporting, storing, and dispensing all medications.
(m) County protocols established for packaging, transporting, storing, and dispensing medications that require refrigeration, including, but not limited to, any biological product as defined in Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 262), an intravenously injected drug, or an infused drug, shall include specific procedures to ensure that these medications are packaged, transported, stored, and dispensed at appropriate temperatures and in accordance with USP standards and the Pharmacy Law.
(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a participating entity shall follow the same procedural drug pedigree requirements for donated drugs as it would follow for drugs purchased from a wholesaler or directly from a drug manufacturer.","Existing law authorizes a county to establish a repository and distribution program under which a pharmacy, including a pharmacy that is owned by, or contracts with, the county, may distribute surplus unused medications, as defined, to persons in need of financial assistance to ensure access to necessary pharmaceutical therapies. Under existing law, only medication that is donated in unopened, tamper-evident packaging or modified unit dose containers that meet the United States Pharmacopoeia standards, and that includes lot numbers and expiration dates, is eligible for donation to the program. Existing law prohibits medication that does not meet the requirements for donation and distribution from being sold, dispensed, or otherwise transferred to any other entity. Existing law requires medication donated to the repository and distribution program to be maintained in the donated packaging units.
This bill would authorize a pharmacy that exists solely to operate the repository and distribution program to repackage a reasonable quantity of donated medicine in anticipation of dispensing the medicine to its patient population. The bill would require a pharmacy that repackages medication to have repackaging policies and procedures in place for identifying and recalling medications, and to label the repackaged medicine with the earliest expiration date.","An act to amend Section 150204 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to pharmaceuticals."
713,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 11401.5 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
11401.5.
(a) (1) Each association that holds a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter and that issues long-term disability or long-term care policies or contracts shall submit to the commissioner the opinion of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items that support the policies or contracts issued pursuant to this chapter, including policies and contracts issued by entities established by these associations that provide benefits described in this chapter, are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board. An association that holds a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter shall file its opinion no later than July 1, 2016. The opinion shall have been completed no earlier than December 31, 2013.
(2) An association is considered to have issued a long-term care or disability policy or contract if it self-funds all or part of the resulting obligation. An association that markets long-term policies or contracts issued by an insurer that is admitted by the department to offer insurance products in the state is exempt from this reporting requirement.
(3) An association seeking a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter shall file an opinion, to the extent feasible, that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits described in this chapter as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations.
(b) The opinion required by subdivision (a) shall include supporting memoranda from the same qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts, when considered in light of the assets held by the association with respect to the reserves and related actuarial items, including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on the assets and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under the policies and contracts, and shall make adequate provision for the association’s obligations under the policies and contracts, including, but not limited to, the benefits and any administrative and operating expenses associated with the policies and contracts.
(c) The opinion required by subdivision (a) shall be governed by the following provisions:
(1) It shall include supporting memoranda consistent with actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board.
(2) If the association fails to provide an opinion and supporting memoranda to the commissioner that meets the requirements of this section, the commissioner shall notify the association of the deficiencies in the filing, and shall make a specific request that identifies the issues that should be addressed in an amended filing. The requests shall be consistent with actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board.
(d) If the commissioner determines, after a review of the filings from the associations, that the laws governing these associations are inadequate to protect the interests of the members of the associations, he or she shall, on or before July 1, 2017, develop and deliver recommendations to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and the Senate Committee on Insurance regarding changes in the law necessary to protect the interests of members of the associations.
(e) Documents, materials, or other information, including the opinion with supporting memoranda, submitted pursuant to this section that are in the possession or control of the Department of Insurance and that are obtained by, created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person pursuant to this section, are recognized by this state as being proprietary and to contain trade secrets. Those documents, materials, or other information shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure by the commissioner pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), and shall not be subject to subpoena or discovery from the commissioner or admissible into evidence, in a private civil action if obtained from the commissioner. The commissioner shall not otherwise make those documents, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the association.
(f) This section shall remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before December 31, 2018, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
Section 11401.6 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
11401.6.
(a) An association that self-funds all or part of the benefits provided under this chapter shall include the following language, or other language approved by the commissioner, in all contracts that are not regulated by the department, and in certificates evidencing coverage under those contracts, in capital letters and in a minimum of 12-point type:


“ALL OR A PORTION OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THIS CONTRACT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, AND THE CONTRACT IS NOT GUARANTEED BY THE CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION.”


(b) This section shall remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before December 31, 2018, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 11401.5 of the Insurance Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect proprietary information, it is necessary to enact legislation that limits the public’s right of access to insurance holding company information that is provided pursuant to Section 11401.5 of the Insurance Code.","Existing law generally provides for the regulation of insurers by the Department of Insurance pursuant to laws set forth in the Insurance Code. Existing law authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to make certain examinations, investigations, and prosecutions and, upon making a determination of the existence of certain conduct, conditions, or grounds, to issue orders reasonably necessary to correct, eliminate, or remedy the conduct, conditions, or grounds.
Existing law exempts from the requirements set forth in the Insurance Code firemen’s, policemen’s, and peace officers’ benefit and relief associations that comply with specified criteria, including, among other things, a requirement that the membership consist solely of peace officers, members of police or fire departments, and emergency medical personnel employed by fire departments, as specified. Existing law prohibits an association from operating or doing business in the state without a certificate of authority.
This bill would require every association that holds a certificate of authority and that issues long-term disability or long-term care policies or contracts, as specified, to submit to the commissioner the opinion, as specified, of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items that support the policies or contracts issued are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on specified actuarial standards. The bill would also require an association seeking a certificate of authority to file an opinion that meets specified requirements and that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits, as specified, as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations. The bill would recognize that information submitted by a company pursuant to those provisions and in the possession or control of the department as proprietary and containing trade secrets. The bill would require that information to be confidential and privileged, exempt from disclosure by the commissioner pursuant to the California Public Records Act, and not subject to subpoena or discovery from the commissioner or admissible into evidence in a private civil action if obtained from the commissioner. The bill would require the commissioner to notify the association of the deficiencies in the filing if the association fails to provide an opinion and supporting memoranda to the commissioner that meets the requirements of the bill, as specified. The bill would require an association that self-funds all or part of the benefits to include specified disclosure language in all contracts that are not regulated by the department and in certificates evidencing coverage under those contracts. The bill would also require the commissioner, if he or she determines that the laws governing these associations are inadequate to protect the interests of the members of the associations, to develop and deliver recommendations to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and the Senate Committee on Insurance regarding changes in the law necessary to protect the interests of members of the associations. The provisions of the bill would remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date would be repealed.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add and repeal Sections 11401.5 and 11401.6 of the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."
714,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 4076 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
4076.
(a) A pharmacist shall not dispense any prescription except in a container that meets the requirements of state and federal law and is correctly labeled with all of the following:
(1) Except when the prescriber or the certified nurse-midwife who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure or protocol described in Section 2746.51, the nurse practitioner who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure described in Section 2836.1 or protocol, the physician assistant who functions pursuant to Section 3502.1, the naturopathic doctor who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure or protocol described in Section 3640.5, or the pharmacist who functions pursuant to a policy, procedure, or protocol pursuant to Section 4052.1, 4052.2, or 4052.6 orders otherwise, either the manufacturer’s trade name of the drug or the generic name and the name of the manufacturer. Commonly used abbreviations may be used. Preparations containing two or more active ingredients may be identified by the manufacturer’s trade name or the commonly used name or the principal active ingredients.
(2) The directions for the use of the drug.

(10) The condition or purpose for which the drug was prescribed if the condition or purpose is indicated on the prescription.
(11) (A) Commencing January 1, 2006, the physical description of the dispensed medication, including its color, shape, and any identification code that appears on the tablets or capsules, except as follows:
(i) Prescriptions dispensed by a veterinarian.
(ii) An exemption from the requirements of this paragraph shall be granted to a new drug for the first 120 days that the drug is on the market and for the 90 days during which the national reference file has no description on file.
(iii) Dispensed medications for which no physical description exists in any commercially available database.
(B) This paragraph applies to outpatient pharmacies only.
(C) The information required by this paragraph may be printed on an auxiliary label that is affixed to the prescription container.
(D) This paragraph shall not become operative if the board, prior to January 1, 2006, adopts regulations that mandate the same labeling requirements set forth in this paragraph.
(b) If a pharmacist dispenses a prescribed drug by means of a unit dose medication system, as defined by administrative regulation, for a patient in a skilled nursing, intermediate care, or other health care facility, the requirements of this section will be satisfied if the unit dose medication system contains the aforementioned information or the information is otherwise readily available at the time of drug administration.
(c) If a pharmacist dispenses a dangerous drug or device in a facility licensed pursuant to Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code, it is not necessary to include on individual unit dose containers for a specific patient, the name of the certified nurse-midwife who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure or protocol described in Section 2746.51, the nurse practitioner who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure described in Section 2836.1 or protocol, the physician assistant who functions pursuant to Section 3502.1, the naturopathic doctor who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure or protocol described in Section 3640.5, or the pharmacist who functions pursuant to a policy, procedure, or protocol pursuant to Section 4052.1, 4052.2, or 4052.6.
(d) If a pharmacist dispenses a prescription drug for use in a facility licensed pursuant to Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code, it is not necessary to include the information required in paragraph (11) of subdivision (a) when the prescription drug is administered to a patient by a person licensed under the Medical Practice Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000)), the Nursing Practice Act (Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 2700)), or the Vocational Nursing Practice Act (Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 2840)), who is acting within his or her scope of practice.
(e) A pharmacist shall use professional judgment to provide a patient with directions for use that enhance the patient’s understanding of those directions, consistent with the prescriber’s instructions.
SEC. 2.
Section 4076.6 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:
4076.6.
(a) Upon the request of a patient or patient’s representative, a dispenser shall provide translated directions for use, which shall be printed on the prescription container, label, or on a supplemental document. If translated directions for use appear on a prescription container or label, the English-language version of the directions for use shall also appear on the container or label, whenever possible, and may appear on other areas of the label outside the patient-centered area. When it is not possible for the English-language directions for use to appear on the container or label, it shall be provided on a supplemental document.
(b) A dispenser may use translations made available by the board pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1707.5 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations to comply with this section.
(c) A dispenser shall not be required to provide translated directions for use beyond the languages that the board has made available or beyond the directions that the board has made available in translated form.
(d) A dispenser may provide his or her own translated directions for use to comply with the requirements of this section, and nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a dispenser from providing translated directions for use in languages beyond those that the board has made available or beyond the directions that the board has made available in translated form.
(e) A dispenser shall be responsible for the accuracy of the English-language directions for use provided to the patient. This section shall not affect a dispenser’s existing responsibility to correctly label a prescription pursuant to Section 4076.
(f) For purposes of this section, a dispenser does not include a veterinarian.
SEC. 3.
Section 4199 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
4199.
(a) Any veterinary food-animal drug dispensed pursuant to a prescription from a licensed veterinarian for food producing animals from a veterinary food-animal drug retailer pursuant to this chapter is subject to the labeling requirements of Sections 4076, 4076.6, and 4077.
(b) All prescriptions filled by a veterinary food-animal drug retailer shall be kept on file and maintained for at least three years in accordance with Section 4333.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Pharmacy Law provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists by the California State Board of Pharmacy. That law requires a pharmacist to dispense a prescription in a container that, among other things, is correctly labeled with the directions for use of the drug, and requires the board to promulgate regulations that require, on or before January 1, 2011, a standardized, patient-centered, prescription drug label on all prescription medicine dispensed to patients in California. Existing regulations of the board implement that requirement, establishing standardized directions for use to be used when applicable, and requiring that the board publish on its Internet Web site translation of those directions for use into at least 5 languages other than English. A violation of that law is a crime.
This bill would require a pharmacist to use professional judgment to provide a patient with directions for use of a prescription that enhance the patient’s understanding of those directions, consistent with the prescriber’s instructions. The bill would also require a dispenser, excluding a veterinarian, upon the request of a patient or patient’s representative, to provide translated directions for use as prescribed. The bill would authorize a dispenser to use translations made available by the board pursuant to those existing regulations. The bill would make a dispenser responsible for the accuracy of English-language directions for use provided to the patient. By imposing new requirements on dispensers, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The Pharmacy Law also provides for the licensure and regulation of veterinary food-animal drug retailers by the board. That law subjects to specific prescription drug labeling requirements any veterinary food-animal drug dispensed pursuant to a prescription from a licensed veterinarian for food-producing animals from a veterinary food-animal drug retailer pursuant to that law.
This bill would also subject any veterinary food-animal drug so dispensed to the above drug labeling requirements relating to standardized directions for use.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 4076 and 4199 of, and to add Section 4076.6 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacy."

(a) For the purposes of this section, “violation” and “noncompliance” mean only the following:
(1) A violation or noncompliance pursuant to Section 25186 that creates a significant risk of harm to the public health or safety of the environment resulting from acute or chronic exposure to hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, and that threat makes it reasonably necessary to take action to prevent, reduce, or mitigate that exposure.

Upon receipt by the department of a notice of defense to the accusation from the holder of the permit, registration, or certificate, the department shall, within 15 days, set the matter for a hearing, which shall be held as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice. The temporary suspension shall remain in effect until the hearing is completed and the department has made a final determination on the merits, which shall be made within 60 days after the completion of the hearing. If the determination is not transmitted within this period, the temporary suspension shall be of no further effect.

Section 25189.4 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
25189.4.
(a) In addition to any penalty imposed under any other law, a person who is subject to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties pursuant to the provisions specified in subdivision (b) shall also be subject to an additional civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for each day of each violation, if the person has been found liable for, or has been convicted of, two or more previous violations subject to the penalties specified in subdivision (b) and those violations or convictions occurred within any consecutive 60 months.
(b) The additional liability specified in subdivision (a) shall apply to a penalty imposed pursuant to, or a conviction under, paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of Section 25187.8, or Section 25189, 25189.2, 25189.3, 25189.5, 25189.6, or 25189.7.","(1) The Hazardous Waste Control Law regulates the use and disposal of hazardous waste and authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to deny, suspend, or revoke any permit, registration, or certificate applied for, or issued to, a person or entity if that person or entity engaged in specified activities in violation of the Hazardous Waste Control Law or other laws.
This bill would require the department to consider, except under specified circumstances, 3 or more violations of, or noncompliance with, specified provisions for which a person or entity has been found liable or has been convicted, with respect to a single hazardous waste facility within a 5-year period, as compelling cause to deny, suspend, or revoke a permit, registration, or certificate applied for by, or issued to, that person or entity.
(2) Existing law authorizes the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that action is necessary to prevent or mitigate an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or safety or the environment. Existing law requires the department, upon receipt of a notice of defense to the accusation from the holder of the permit, registration, or certificate, to set the matter for hearing within 15 days and to hold the hearing as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Existing law requires the hearing to be held without delay and completed as soon as possible.
This bill would instead authorize the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that conditions may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety or the environment. The bill would repeal the requirement that the hearing be held without delay and completed as soon as possible.
(3) Existing law provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties upon persons who violate the requirements of the hazardous waste control law or take other actions with regard to the handling of hazardous waste.
This bill would impose, upon a person who is subject to the imposition of those civil or criminal penalties, an additional civil penalty of not less than $5,000 or more than $50,000 for each day of each violation, if the person has been found liable for, or been convicted of, 2 or more previous violations of certain of these hazardous waste-related provisions within any consecutive 60 months.","An act to amend Sections 25186 and 25186.2 of, and to add Sections 25186.05 and 25189.4 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to hazardous waste."
716,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Mutual water companies are nonprofit entities that seek to provide quality water service to their residential, commercial, municipal, and agricultural shareholders or members, many through small water systems and in disadvantaged communities throughout the state.
(b) Since 2013, mutual water companies have made great improvements to water quality and service reliability across California, as well as to the transparency of their operations and finances.
(c) Mutual water companies have been leaders in promoting water conservation and efficiency since the drought emergency in California began.
(d) Mutual water companies serve as the sole water provider in their service territories and act in many ways like public agencies, and they therefore should take reasonable steps to ensure their shareholders and customers have a voice in the operations of the company.
(e) Many mutual water companies have small or no meeting facilities, some of which meet in board members’ residences, that can safely hold only a limited number of people, and are located in remote parts of California that are difficult to access by some shareholders and customers of the mutual water company.
(f) Many small mutual water companies have limited financial means and it is important that their financial resources be put to efficient use in fulfilling their duty to provide safe and affordable water to their shareholders and members.
(g) Mutual water companies are unique, and unlike large public agencies or for-profit utilities, these nonprofit organizations are solely responsible to their shareholders and customers and not the broader public outside of their service area.
(h) Given the distinctive operational constraints faced by mutual water companies, the Legislature believes that mutual water companies should, where economically and technologically feasible, have means to provide the greatest shareholder and customer access to meetings within these constraints.
SEC. 2.
Section 14305 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:
14305.
(a) (1) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Mutual Water Company Open Meeting Act.

The teleconferenced meeting or proceeding shall comply with this section and all other applicable provisions of law relating to a specific type of meeting or proceeding conducted by a mutual water company. If the board uses teleconferencing, the board shall provide to an eligible person attending a meeting by teleconference, before the meeting begins, an electronic copy or photocopy of all documents not related to an executive session to be discussed at the meeting. A board of directors of a mutual water company shall not prohibit an eligible person from attending a meeting of the board either in person, so long as the eligible person has complied with the notice requirement of paragraph (A), or by teleconference except as provided by paragraph (2).

(c) Any matter discussed in executive session shall be generally noted in the minutes of the meeting at which the executive session occurred.

Notice shall be given by posting the notice in a prominent, publicly accessible place or places within the territory served by the mutual water company and by mail to any eligible person who had requested notification of board meetings by mail, at the address requested by the eligible person. Eligible persons requesting notice by mail shall pay the costs of reproduction and mailing of the notice in advance. Notice may also be given by mail, by delivery of the notice to each unit served by the mutual water company, or, with the consent of the eligible person, by electronic means. The notice shall contain the agenda for the meeting.
(g) An emergency meeting of the board may be called by the chief executive officer of the mutual water company, or by any two members of the board of directors other than the chief executive officer, if there are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen which require immediate attention and possible action by the board, and which of necessity make it impracticable to provide notice as required by this section.
(h) The board of directors of a mutual water company shall permit any eligible person to speak at any meeting of the mutual water company or the board of directors, except for any portion of a meeting that is held in executive session outside the presence of eligible persons. A reasonable time limit for all eligible persons to speak to the board of directors or before a meeting of the mutual water company shall be established by the board of directors.

(4) (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the board of directors may take action on any item of business not appearing on the agenda posted and distributed pursuant to subdivision (f) under any of the following conditions:
(i) Upon a determination made by a majority of the board of directors present at the meeting that an emergency situation exists. An emergency situation exists if there are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board, that require immediate attention and possible action by the board, and that, of necessity, make it impracticable to provide notice.
(ii) Upon a determination made by the board by a vote of two-thirds of the members present at the meeting, or, if less than two-thirds of total membership of the board is present at the meeting, by a unanimous vote of the members present, that there is a need to take immediate action and that the need for action came to the attention of the board after the agenda was posted and distributed pursuant to subdivision (f).
(iii) The item appeared on an agenda that was posted and distributed pursuant to subdivision (f) for a prior meeting of the board of directors that occurred not more than 30 calendar days before the date that action is taken on the item and, at the prior meeting, action on the item was continued to the meeting at which the action is taken.
(B) Before discussing any item pursuant to this paragraph, the board of directors shall openly identify the item to the members in attendance at the meeting.
(j) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, the board of directors shall not take action on any item of business outside of a meeting.
(2) (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of directors shall not conduct a meeting via a series of electronic transmissions, including, but not limited to, electronic mail, except as specified in subparagraph (B).
(B) Electronic transmissions may be used as a method of conducting an emergency meeting if all members of the board, individually or collectively, consent in writing to that action, and if the written consent or consents are filed with the minutes of the meeting of the board. These written consents may be transmitted electronically.
(k) (1) An eligible person may bring a civil action for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this section by a mutual water company for which he or she is defined as an eligible person for a judicial determination that an action taken by the board is null and void under this section.
(2) Prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to paragraph (1), the eligible person shall make a demand on the board to cure or correct the action alleged to be taken in violation of this section. The demand shall be in writing, and submitted within 90 days from the date the action was taken. The demand shall state the challenged action of the board and the nature of the alleged violation.
(3) Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the board shall cure or correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct, or inform the demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action.
(4) Within 15 days of receipt of the written notice of the board’s decision to cure or correct or not to cure or correct, or within 15 days of the expiration of the 30-day period to cure or correct, whichever is earlier, the demanding party shall commence the action pursuant to paragraph (1). If the demanding party fails to commence the action pursuant to paragraph (1), that party shall be barred from commencing the action thereafter.
(l) A board action that is alleged to have been taken in violation of this section shall not be determined to be void if the action taken was in substantial compliance with this section.
(m) The fact that the board of directors of a mutual water company takes subsequent action to cure or correct an action taken pursuant to this section shall not be construed as, or admissible as evidence of, a violation of this section.
(n) An eligible person who prevails in a civil action to enforce his or her rights pursuant to this section shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs. A prevailing mutual water company shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.
(o) As used in this section:
(1) “Eligible person” means a person who is any of the following:
(A) A shareholder or member of the mutual water company.
(B) A person who is an occupant, pursuant to a lease or a rental agreement, of commercial space or a dwelling unit to which the mutual water company sells, distributes, supplies, or delivers drinking water.
(C) An elected official of a city or county who represents people who receive drinking water directly from the mutual water company on a retail basis.
(D) Any other person eligible to participate in the mutual water company’s meetings under provisions of the company’s articles or bylaws.
(2) “Item of business” means any action within the authority of the board, except those actions that the board has validly delegated to any other person or persons, officer of the mutual water company, or committee of the board comprising less than a majority of the directors.
(3) “Meeting” means either of the following:
(A) A congregation of a majority of the members of the board at the same time and place to hear, discuss, or deliberate upon any item of business that is within the authority of the board.
(B) A teleconference in which a majority of the members of the board, in different locations, are connected by electronic means, through audio or video or both. A teleconference meeting shall be conducted in a manner that protects the rights of members of the mutual water company and otherwise complies with the requirements of this title. The notice of the teleconference meeting shall identify at least one physical location so that members of the mutual water company may attend and at least one member of the board of directors or a person designated by the board shall be present at that location. Participation by board members in a teleconference meeting constitutes presence at that meeting as long as all board members participating in the meeting are able to hear one another and members of the mutual water company speaking on matters before the board.
(4) “Mutual water company” means a mutual water company, as defined in Section 14300, that operates a public water system, as defined in Section 14300.5.","Under existing law, a mutual water company is defined as a corporation organized for or engaged in the business of selling, distributing, supplying, or delivering water for irrigation or domestic purposes that provides in its articles or bylaws that the water shall be sold, distributed, supplied, or delivered only to owners of its shares, as specified.
A mutual water company may be organized under the General Corporation Law or the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law. The Mutual Water Company Open Meeting Act authorizes an eligible person, upon 24 hours advance written notice, to attend meetings of the board of directors of a mutual water company that operates a public water system, except when the board adjourns to, or meets solely in, executive session.
This bill would prohibit a mutual water company from meeting solely in an executive session without holding a meeting. The bill would require notice of a meeting to be given to an eligible person at least 4 days prior to the meetings. The bill would require a board of directors of a mutual water company to allow an eligible person to personally attend a meeting of the board, if the eligible person gave the board at least 24 hours advance written notice of his or her intent to personally attend the meeting. The bill would authorize the board to allow an eligible person who was denied attendance at a meeting for failure to provide this notice, or because the number of eligible persons having already provided notice of attendance exceeds the room capacity of the place of the meeting, to attend the meeting by teleconference, and would further require the board to provide to an eligible person attending a meeting by teleconference a copy of the documents to be discussed at the meeting, as specified.","An act to amend Section 14305 of the Corporations Code, relating to mutual water companies."

SECTION 1.
Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
34171.
The following terms shall have the following meanings:
(a) “Administrative budget” means the budget for administrative costs of the successor agencies as provided in Section 34177.
(b) “Administrative cost allowance” means an amount that, subject to the approval of the oversight board, is payable from property tax revenues of up to 5 percent of the property tax allocated to the successor agency on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule covering the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3 percent of the property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund money that is allocated to the successor agency for each fiscal year thereafter; provided, however, that the amount shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), unless the oversight board reduces this amount, for any fiscal year or such lesser amount as agreed to by the successor agency. However, the allowance amount shall exclude, and shall not apply to, any administrative costs that can be paid from bond proceeds or from sources other than property tax. Administrative cost allowances shall exclude any litigation expenses related to assets or obligations, settlements and judgments, and the costs of maintaining assets prior to disposition. Employee costs associated with work on specific project implementation activities, including, but not limited to, construction inspection, project management, or actual construction, shall be considered project-specific costs and shall not constitute administrative costs.
(c) “Designated local authority” shall mean a public entity formed pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 34173.
(d) (1) “Enforceable obligation” means any of the following:
(A) Bonds, as defined by Section 33602 and bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 5850) of Division 6 of Title 1 of the Government Code, including the required debt service, reserve set-asides, and any other payments required under the indenture or similar documents governing the issuance of the outstanding bonds of the former redevelopment agency. A reserve may be held when required by the bond indenture or when the next property tax allocation will be insufficient to pay all obligations due under the provisions of the bond for the next payment due in the following half of the calendar year.
(B) Loans of moneys borrowed by the redevelopment agency for a lawful purpose, to the extent they are legally required to be repaid pursuant to a required repayment schedule or other mandatory loan terms.
(C) Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state or obligations imposed by state law, other than passthrough payments that are made by the county auditor-controller pursuant to Section 34183, or legally enforceable payments required in connection with the agencies’ employees, including, but not limited to, pension payments, pension obligation debt service, unemployment payments, or other obligations conferred through a collective bargaining agreement. Costs incurred to fulfill collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who performed work directly on behalf of the former redevelopment agency shall be considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. The obligations to employees specified in this subparagraph shall remain enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds for any employee to whom those obligations apply if that employee is transferred to the entity assuming the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to Section 34176. The successor agency or designated local authority shall enter into an agreement with the housing entity to reimburse it for any costs of the employee obligations.
(D) Judgments or settlements entered by a competent court of law or binding arbitration decisions against the former redevelopment agency, other than passthrough payments that are made by the county auditor-controller pursuant to Section 34183. Along with the successor agency, the oversight board shall have the authority and standing to appeal any judgment or to set aside any settlement or arbitration decision.
(E) Any legally binding and enforceable agreement or contract that is not otherwise void as violating the debt limit or public policy. However, nothing in this act shall prohibit either the successor agency, with the approval or at the direction of the oversight board, or the oversight board itself from terminating any existing agreements or contracts and providing any necessary and required compensation or remediation for such termination. Titles of or headings used on or in a document shall not be relevant in determining the existence of an enforceable obligation.
(F) Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, in accordance with this part, including, but not limited to, agreements concerning litigation expenses related to assets or obligations, settlements and judgments, and the costs of maintaining assets prior to disposition, and agreements to purchase or rent office space, equipment and supplies, and pay-related expenses pursuant to Section 33127 and for carrying insurance pursuant to Section 33134.
(G) Amounts borrowed from, or payments owing to, the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency, which had been deferred as of the effective date of the act adding this part; provided, however, that the repayment schedule is approved by the oversight board. Repayments shall be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund established pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 34176 as a housing asset and shall be used in a manner consistent with the affordable housing requirements of the Community Redevelopment Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000)).
(2) For purposes of this part, “enforceable obligation” does not include any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. However, written agreements entered into (A) at the time of issuance, but in no event later than December 31, 2010, of indebtedness obligations, and (B) solely for the purpose of securing or repaying those indebtedness obligations may be deemed enforceable obligations for purposes of this part. Notwithstanding this paragraph, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created it, within two years of the date of creation of the redevelopment agency, may be deemed to be enforceable obligations.
(3) Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies, to perform services or provide funding for governmental or private services or capital projects outside of redevelopment project areas that do not provide benefit to the redevelopment project and thus were not properly authorized under Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000) shall be deemed void on the effective date of this part; provided, however, that such contracts or agreements for the provision of housing properly authorized under Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000) shall not be deemed void.
(4) The department may determine that an agreement between a former redevelopment agency and a joint powers authority that was created to exercise the powers provided by the Military Base Reuse Authority Act (Title 7.86 (commencing with Section 67800) of the Government Code) is an enforceable obligation.
(e) “Indebtedness obligations” means bonds, notes, certificates of participation, or other evidence of indebtedness, issued or delivered by the redevelopment agency, or by a joint exercise of powers authority created by the redevelopment agency, to third-party investors or bondholders to finance or refinance redevelopment projects undertaken by the redevelopment agency in compliance with the Community Redevelopment Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 33000)).
(f) “Oversight board” shall mean each entity established pursuant to Section 34179.
(g) “Recognized obligation” means an obligation listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule.
(h) “Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule” means the document setting forth the minimum payment amounts and due dates of payments required by enforceable obligations for each six-month fiscal period as provided in subdivision (m) of Section 34177.
(i) “School entity” means any entity defined as such in subdivision (f) of Section 95 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(j) “Successor agency” means the successor entity to the former redevelopment agency as described in Section 34173.
(k) “Taxing entities” means cities, counties, a city and county, special districts, and school entities, as defined in subdivision (f) of Section 95 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, that receive passthrough payments and distributions of property taxes pursuant to the provisions of this part.
(l) “Property taxes” include all property tax revenues, including those from unitary and supplemental and roll corrections applicable to tax increment.
(m) “Department” means the Department of Finance unless the context clearly refers to another state agency.
(n) “Sponsoring entity” means the city, county, or city and county, or other entity that authorized the creation of each redevelopment agency.
(o) “Final judicial determination” means a final judicial determination made by any state court that is not appealed, or by a court of appellate jurisdiction that is not further appealed, in an action by any party.
(p) From July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, inclusive, “housing entity administrative cost allowance” means an amount of up to 1 percent of the property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund on behalf of the successor agency for each applicable fiscal year, but not less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) per fiscal year.
(1) If a local housing authority assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 34176, then the housing entity administrative cost allowance shall be listed by the successor agency on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. Upon approval of the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule by the oversight board and the department, the housing entity administrative cost allowance shall be remitted by the successor agency on each January 2 and July 1 to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 34176.
(2) If there are insufficient moneys in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund in a given fiscal year to make the payment authorized by this subdivision, the unfunded amount may be listed on each subsequent Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule until it has been paid in full. In these cases the five-year time limit on the payments shall not apply.","Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law defines “enforceable obligation” for these purposes to generally exclude any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency.
The Military Base Reuse Authority Act authorizes the creation of a military base reuse authority to plan, finance, and manage the transition of a military base from military to civilian use, as specified.
This bill would authorize the Department of Finance to find that an agreement between a former redevelopment agency and a joint powers authority that was created to exercise the powers provided by the Military Base Reuse Authority Act is an enforceable obligation.","An act to amend Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to redevelopment."

(4) The commission shall adopt regulations that establish a grace period for receipt of the grade point average and any appropriate corrections, and that set forth the circumstances under which a student may submit a specified test score designated by the commission, by regulation, in lieu of submitting a qualifying grade point average.
(5) It is the intent of the Legislature that high schools and institutions of higher education certify the grade point averages of their students in time to meet the application deadlines imposed by this chapter.
(6) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission make available to each high school and school district a report identifying all grade 12 pupils within the high school or school district, respectively, who have and have not completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or the California Dream Act Application.
(d) (1) The school district or charter school shall, no later than October 15 of a pupil’s grade 12 academic year, notify, in writing, each grade 12 pupil and, for a pupil under 18 years of age, his or her parent or guardian that, pursuant to subdivision (a), the pupil will be deemed a Cal Grant applicant unless the pupil opts out within a period of time specified in the notice, which shall not be less than 30 days. The required notice shall indicate when the school will first send grade point averages to the commission. The school district or charter school shall provide an opportunity for the pupil to opt out of being automatically deemed a Cal Grant applicant.
(2) Until a pupil turns 18 years of age, only a parent or guardian may opt the pupil out. Once a pupil turns 18 years of age, only the pupil may opt himself or herself out and, if prior to the conclusion of the notice period, the pupil may opt in over the prior decision of a parent or guardian to opt out.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","The Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C award, and the Cal Grant T award under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. As part of these eligibility requirements, existing law requires the commission to require that a grade point average be submitted to it electronically for all grade 12 pupils at public schools, including charter schools, each academic year, except as specified.
This bill would require this electronic submission to be on a standardized form. The bill would also authorize the commission to require that verification of high school graduation or its equivalent be electronically submitted for all former grade 12 pupils who graduated from public schools, including charter schools, in the prior academic year, except for pupils who have opted out, as specified. By requiring the electronic submission of grade point average information to be on a standardized form, and authorizing the commission to additionally require verification of graduation information of prior grade 12 pupils, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 69432.9 of, and to add Section 69432.92 to, the Education Code, relating to student financial aid."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Whereas, on May 23, 2011, the United States Supreme Court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5 percent of design capacity within two years from the date of its ruling.
(b) As of December 10, 2014, the prison population was at 140 percent of design capacity, exceeding the final February 2016 population cap by approximately 2,104 inmates.
(c) The 2011 Public Safety Realignment, addressing public safety and, in an effort to reduce California’s prison population, shifted to counties the responsibility for monitoring, tracking, and incarcerating lower level offenders previously sent to state prison. By mid-2013, more than 100,000 offenders had been diverted to county supervision instead of going to state prisons.
(d) On November 4, 2014, the voters of California passed Proposition 47, which requires misdemeanor rather than felony sentencing for certain property and drug crimes and permits inmates previously sentenced for these reclassified crimes to petition for resentencing. As of December 4, 2014, 132 inmates had been resentenced and released from prison. Under this proposition, it is estimated that the 2015–16 institution average daily population will be reduced by approximately 1,900 inmates as a result of resentencing and the reduction in new admissions.
(e) Research shows that formerly incarcerated individuals do better and remain out of prison longer when they have training and a job with advancement opportunities. Obtaining quality jobs, however, is not realistic for many incarcerated individuals without additional training education. Workforce training opportunities to men and women reentering our communities ensures that they gain training and education, job readiness skills, and job placement assistance required for securing necessary employment after being released from prison. This would lower repeat offenses, and ultimately, the number of people incarcerated, as a number of studies have proven that people are less likely to offend or recidivate if they are gainfully employed.
(f) Investing in services and supports for the reentry population is also consistent with statewide workforce goals. California’s Strategic Workforce Development Plan 2013–2017 includes the goal of providing access to quality employment services for formally incarcerated individuals as an overarching priority for the State Workforce Investment Board.

In order to provide cost savings to the state by making the grant program operate more efficiently as soon as possible, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law establishes the California Workforce Investment Board (State WIB) to assist the Governor in the development, oversight, and improvement of the state workforce investment system and the alignment of the education and workforce systems, as specified. Existing law also establishes local workforce investment boards to assist in the planning, oversight, and evaluation of local workforce investment.
Existing law establishes the Supervised Population Workforce Training Grant Program to be administered by the State WIB. The program awards grants on a competitive basis to counties that propose a project that provides, at a minimum, an education and training assessment for persons who are on probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision and are supervised by, or under the jurisdiction of, a county. Existing law establishes criteria for the grant program, including that the education and training needs of both individuals who have some postsecondary education, and those who require basic education and training, are addressed. Existing law requires each project proposed in the application for a grant to include a provision for an education and training assessment for each individual of the supervised population who participates in the project, and provides that a prior assessment of an individual may be used if, in the determination of the State WIB, its results are accurate. Existing law requires grant recipients to report to the State WIB, at least annually and upon completion of the grant period, regarding their use of the funds and workforce training program outcomes. Existing law requires, by January 1, 2018, the State WIB to submit a report to the Legislature using the reports from the grant recipients, and requires the report to contain specified information.
This bill would revise the criteria for the grant program by authorizing a grant applicant to address the education and training needs of individuals who have some postsecondary education, or individuals who require basic education and training, or individuals in both categories. The bill would authorize the State WIB to delegate the responsibility for determining the sufficiency of a prior assessment to one or more local workforce investment boards. The bill would also require the report to the Legislature to include a discussion of the education and workforce readiness of the supervised population at the time individual participants entered the program and how this impacted the types of services needed and offered, and whether the metrics used to evaluate the individual grants were sufficiently aligned with the objectives of the program.

720,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a)  The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Residential and commercial buildings and the systems and equipment within them were responsible for 69 percent of all electricity consumption in California in 2013, the equivalent output of 70 500-megawatt powerplants. Under the 2000–13 historical growth trends, this is projected to increase to the equivalent of 79 powerplants by 2030. The electric power sector is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California after transportation, comprising 21 percent of the state’s total emissions.
(2) Plug-in equipment is responsible for two-thirds of electricity consumption in residential buildings and a significant share of electricity consumption in office buildings. This electricity consumption is increasing rapidly, indicating that current plug-in equipment efficiency policy efforts are outpaced by the growth in the number of electronic devices and their electricity consumption, jeopardizing California’s ability to meet its energy and climate goals.
(3) Cost-effective technologies such as those used in mobile electronic devices already exist to significantly reduce the electricity consumption of plug-in equipment, but are not used in the majority of plug-in electronic devices.
(4) California has set ambitious goals for renewable energy and energy efficiency in the envelope, major systems, and lighting of buildings, but does not have quantified goals for a category that now represents two-thirds of the electricity consumption in the state’s residential buildings and a significant share of the electricity consumption in commercial buildings.
(5) Market barriers, such as a lack of consumer awareness and information on product lifetime energy costs, and split incentives between manufacturers who make product design decisions and consumers who pay the electricity bill, give efficiency programs and standards a critical role in realizing the economic potential for energy efficiency in plug-in equipment.
(6) Challenges with the evaluation and the attribution of program savings to utilities and program implementers, as well as the focus on short-term savings, are limiting the effective use of these programs to capture energy-saving opportunities that require upfront investment to yield large future savings through market transformation.
(7) The State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and the Public Utilities Commission have set a goal to achieve zero net energy for all new residential buildings by 2020 and for all new, and a substantial proportion of existing, commercial buildings by 2030.
(8) The Legislature supports the zero net energy goals of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and the Public Utilities Commission as a key strategy to decarbonize the California economy.
(9) Plug-in equipment electricity consumption may not be fully accounted for in zero net energy models, leading to buildings designed and certified as zero net energy not necessarily achieving zero net energy in real-world operation when occupants bring in typical plug-in equipment.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that, in support of the state’s climate and energy goals, plug-in equipment energy consumption is reduced where technologically feasible and cost effective.

(3) “Plug-in equipment” does not include the following:
(A) Non-plug-in HVAC, including split, packaged, or built-up HVAC equipment that is typically installed by an HVAC contractor.
(B) Lighting, whether built in or portable.
(C) Infrastructure loads wired directly to the building electrical system, such as ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) breakers and outlets, wired smoke or carbon monoxide detectors, and lighting switches.
(D) Electric vehicles.
(4) For purposes of this subdivision, power outlets include line outlets, such as 110-volt alternating current (AC) and other emerging power delivery mechanisms, including Universal Serial Bus (USB), Power over Ethernet (PoE), and 24-volt direct current (VDC).
(b) The commission shall, in collaboration with the Public Utilities Commission, do all of the following:
(1) Conduct an analysis of plug-in equipment electricity consumption, including appliances, electronics, and miscellaneous electric loads, to assess current use and trends. The commission shall draw on existing data and already-funded studies where appropriate to limit costs and reduce the time required to complete the analysis. The analysis shall focus on the top 80 percent of plug-in equipment average annual electricity consumption.
(2) Before January 1, 2018, set statewide, long-term energy efficiency targets
for
to reduce
the
amount of
electricity consumed by plug-in equipment.
(3) Develop an implementation plan, in consultation with stakeholders, including equipment manufacturers and retailers, to achieve the targets
set forth in
established under
paragraph (2). The implementation plan shall meet all of the following requirements:
(A) Be comprised of a complementary portfolio of techniques, applications, and practices that may include, but need not be limited to: revising existing, and setting new, appliance efficiency standards; working with federal government agencies to revise existing, and implement new, federal standards; implementing incentive programs, appliance early replacement rebate programs that link purchase and disposal rebates, and upstream market transformation programs; expanding research and development; and public outreach and education efforts.
(B) Consider costs and ratepayer protections, consistent with Section 25000.1.
(C) Use an accurate cost-effectiveness methodology for assessing the long-term value of efficiency savings and ensure that benefits outweigh costs to ratepayers.
(4) Track the progress of the implementation plan in meeting the targets annually through the Electricity Supply Analysis Division of the commission and the Energy Division of the Public Utilities Commission.
(5) Revise the implementation plan and priorities in consultation with stakeholders.
(6) Update the implementation plan, as a part of the integrated energy policy report required pursuant to Section 25302, with a report on the progress toward meeting the targets through the tracking required pursuant to paragraph (4).
(c) The Public Utilities Commission shall, in collaboration with the commission, work with stakeholders, including equipment manufacturers, equipment retailers, and electric utilities, to address challenges that may limit or inhibit the achievement of the targets set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), including, but not limited to, the evaluation and attribution of energy savings and the enabling of market transformation programs.","Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission), on a biennial basis, to conduct assessments and forecasts of all aspects of energy industry supply, production, transportation, delivery, and distribution. Existing law requires the Energy Commission, beginning November 1, 2003, and biennially thereafter, to adopt an integrated energy policy report containing an overview of major energy trends and issues facing the state.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory jurisdiction over the public utilities, including electrical corporations.

(g) (1) Notwithstanding Title 5 (commencing with Section 3426) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code and Article 11 (commencing with Section 1060) of Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code, all records that the facility or operator is reasonably required to keep to allow the department to verify information in, or verification of, the reports required pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) and implementing regulations shall be subject to inspection and copying by the department, but shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).
(2) Notwithstanding Title 5 (commencing with Section 3426) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code and Article 11 (commencing with Section 1060) of Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code, an employee of a government entity may, at the disposal facility, inspect and copy records related to tonnage received at the facility on or after July 1, 2015, and originating within the government entity’s geographic jurisdiction. Those records shall be limited to weight tags that identify the hauler, vehicle, quantity, date, type, and origin of waste received at a disposal facility. Those records shall be available to those government entities for the purposes of subdivision (a) and as necessary to enforce the collection of local fees, but those records shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code). Names of haulers using specific landfills shall not be disclosed by a government entity unless necessary as part of an administrative or judicial enforcement proceeding to fund local programs or enforce local franchises.
(3) A government entity may petition the superior court for injunctive or declaratory relief to enforce its authority under paragraph (2). The times for responsive pleadings and hearings in these proceedings shall be set by the judge of the court with the object of securing a decision as to these matters at the earliest possible time.
(4) For purposes of this section, a government entity is an entity identified in Section 40145 or an entity formed pursuant to Section 40976.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “disposal” and “disposal facility” have the same meanings as prescribed by Sections 40120.1 and 40121, respectively.
(6) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit or expand the authority of a government entity that may have been provided by this section and implementing regulations as they read on December 31, 2015.
(7) The records subject to inspection and copying by the department pursuant to paragraph (1) or by an employee of a government entity pursuant to paragraph (2) may be redacted by the operator before inspection to exclude confidential pricing information contained in the records, such as contract terms and conditions (including information on pricing, credit terms, volume discounts, and other proprietary business terms), if the redacted information is not information that is otherwise required to be reported to the department.
(h) Notwithstanding the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Title 2.5 (commencing with Section 1633.1) of Part 2 of Division 3 of the Civil Code), reports required by this section shall be submitted electronically, using an electronic reporting format system established by the department.
(i) All records provided in accordance with this section shall be subject to Section 40062.","The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, generally regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of solid waste. Existing law requires exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost to submit periodic information to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred.
This bill would additionally require a self-hauler to submit that information to the department and would require the department to develop regulations that define “self-hauler” to include specified persons and entities.","An act to amend Section 41821.5 of the Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste."

Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
17206.
Civil Penalty for Violation of Chapter
(a) Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation, which shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General, by any district attorney, by any county counsel authorized by agreement with the district attorney in actions involving violation of a county ordinance, by any city attorney of a city having a population in excess of
750,000,
250,000,
by any city attorney of any city and county, or, with the consent of the district attorney, by a city prosecutor in any city having a full-time city prosecutor, in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) The court shall impose a civil penalty for each violation of this chapter. In assessing the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the following: the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant’s misconduct, and the defendant’s assets, liabilities, and net worth.
(c) If the action is brought by the Attorney General, one-half of the penalty collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the judgment was entered, and one-half to the General Fund. If the action is brought by a district attorney or county counsel, the penalty collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the judgment was entered. Except as provided in subdivision (e), if the action is brought by a city attorney or city prosecutor, one-half of the penalty collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the city in which the judgment was entered, and one-half to the treasurer of the county in which the judgment was entered. The aforementioned funds shall be for the exclusive use by the Attorney General, the district attorney, the county counsel, and the city attorney for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.
(d) The Unfair Competition Law Fund is hereby created as a special account within the General Fund in the State Treasury. The portion of penalties that is payable to the General Fund or to the Treasurer recovered by the Attorney General from an action or settlement of a claim made by the Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 shall be deposited into this fund. Moneys in this fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be used by the Attorney General to support investigations and prosecutions of California’s consumer protection laws, including implementation of judgments obtained from such prosecutions or investigations and other activities which are in furtherance of this chapter or Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3. Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, any civil penalties deposited in the fund pursuant to the National Mortgage Settlement, as provided in Section 12531 of the Government Code, are continuously appropriated to the Department of Justice for the purpose of offsetting General Fund costs incurred by the Department of Justice.
(e) If the action is brought at the request of a board within the Department of Consumer Affairs or a local consumer affairs agency, the court shall determine the reasonable expenses incurred by the board or local agency in the investigation and prosecution of the action.
Before any penalty collected is paid out pursuant to subdivision (c), the amount of any reasonable expenses incurred by the board shall be paid to the Treasurer for deposit in the special fund of the board described in Section 205. If the board has no such special fund, the moneys shall be paid to the Treasurer. The amount of any reasonable expenses incurred by a local consumer affairs agency shall be paid to the general fund of the municipality or county that funds the local agency.
(f) If the action is brought by a city attorney of a city and county, the entire amount of the penalty collected shall be paid to the treasurer of the city and county in which the judgment was entered for the exclusive use by the city attorney for the enforcement of consumer protection laws. However, if the action is brought by a city attorney of a city and county for the purposes of civil enforcement pursuant to Section 17980 of the Health and Safety Code or Article 3 (commencing with Section 11570) of Chapter 10 of Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, either the penalty collected shall be paid entirely to the treasurer of the city and county in which the judgment was entered or, upon the request of the city attorney, the court may order that up to one-half of the penalty, under court supervision and approval, be paid for the purpose of restoring, maintaining, or enhancing the premises that were the subject of the action, and that the balance of the penalty be paid to the treasurer of the city and county.
SECTION 1.
Section 66499.7 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
66499.7.
The security furnished by the subdivider shall be released in whole or in part in the following manner:
(a)Security given for faithful performance of any act or agreement shall be released upon the performance of the act or final completion and acceptance of the required work. The legislative body may provide for the partial release of the security upon the partial performance of the act or the acceptance of the work as it progresses, consistent with the provisions of this section. The security may be a surety bond, a cash deposit, a letter of credit, escrow account, or other form of performance guarantee required as security by the legislative body that meets the requirements as acceptable security pursuant to law. If the security furnished by the subdivider is a documentary evidence of security such as a surety bond or a letter of credit, the legislative body shall release the documentary evidence and return the original to the issuer upon performance of the act or final completion and acceptance of the required work. In the event that the legislative body is unable to return the original documentary evidence to the issuer, the security shall be released by written notice sent by certified mail to the subdivider and issuer of the documentary evidence within 30 days of the acceptance of the work. The written notice shall contain a statement that the work for which the security was furnished has been performed or completed and accepted by the legislative body, a description of the project subject to the documentary evidence and the notarized signature of the authorized representative of the legislative body.
(b)At the time that the subdivider believes that the obligation to perform the work for which security was required is complete, the subdivider may notify the local agency in writing of the completed work, including a list of work completed. Upon receipt of the written notice, the local agency shall have 45 days to review and comment or approve the completion of the required work. If the local agency does not agree that all work has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications for the improvements, it shall supply a list of all remaining work to be completed.
(c)Within 45 days of receipt of the list of remaining work from the local agency, the subdivider may then provide cost estimates for all remaining work for review and approval by the local agency. Upon receipt of the cost estimates, the local agency shall then have 45 days to review, comment, and approve, modify, or disapprove those cost estimates. No local agency shall be required to engage in this process of partial release more than once between the start of work and completion and acceptance of all work; however, nothing in this section prohibits a local agency from allowing for a partial release as it otherwise deems appropriate.
(d)If the local agency approves the cost estimate, the local agency shall release all performance security except for security in an amount up to 200 percent of the cost estimate of the remaining work. The process allowing for a partial release of performance security shall occur when the cost estimate of the remaining work does not exceed 20 percent of the total original performance security unless the local agency allows for a release at an earlier time. Substitute bonds or other security may be used as a replacement for the performance security, subject to the approval of the local agency. If substitute bonds or other security is used as a replacement for the performance security released, the release shall not be effective unless and until the local agency receives and approves that form of replacement security. A reduction in the performance security, authorized under this section, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, an acceptance by the local agency of the completed improvements, and the risk of loss or damage to the improvements and the obligation to maintain the improvements shall remain the sole responsibility of the subdivider until all required public improvements have been accepted by the local agency and all other required improvements have been fully completed in accordance with the plans and specifications for the improvements.
(e)The subdivider shall complete the works of improvement until all remaining items are accepted by the local agency.
(f)Upon the completion of the improvements, the subdivider, or his or her assigns, shall be notified in writing by the local agency within 45 days.
(g)Within 45 days of the issuance of the notification by the local agency, the release of any remaining performance security shall be placed upon the agenda of the legislative body of the local agency for approval of the release of any remaining performance security. If the local agency delegates authority for the release of performance security to a public official or other employee, any remaining performance security shall be released within 60 days of the issuance of the written statement of completion.
(h)Security securing the payment to the contractor, his or her subcontractors and to persons furnishing labor, materials or equipment shall, after passage of the time within which claims of lien are required to be recorded pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 8410) of Chapter 4 of Title 2 of Part 6 of Division 4 of the Civil Code and after acceptance of the work, be reduced to an amount equal to the total claimed by all claimants for whom claims of lien have been recorded and notice thereof given in writing to the legislative body, and if no claims have been recorded, the security shall be released in full.
(i)The release shall not apply to any required guarantee and warranty period required by Section 66499.9 for the guarantee or warranty nor to the amount of the security deemed necessary by the local agency for the guarantee and warranty period nor to costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
(j)The legislative body may authorize any of its public officers or employees to authorize release or reduction of the security in accordance with the conditions hereinabove set forth and in accordance with any rules that it may prescribe.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law defines unfair competition to include an unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, and any false representations to the public. Existing law, as amended by Proposition 64 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, authorizes an action for relief from this prohibited conduct to be brought by, among others, a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition. Existing law also authorizes an action for relief from this prohibited conduct and for civil penalties to be brought by a city attorney of a city having a population in excess of 750,000.
This bill would expand this authorization to allow actions for relief and civil penalties by city attorneys of cities having a population in excess of 250,000, as provided.
The Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances authorize or require, under specified circumstances, the furnishing of specified types of security with respect to the performance of various acts or agreements subject to the act. Existing law, until January 1, 2016, also sets forth the specific procedures imposed on a local agency for the complete or partial release of a performance security furnished by a subdivider.
This bill would delete the repeal of the provisions relating to the procedures for releasing a performance security, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely and imposing a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 66499.7 of the Government Code, relating to subdivided lands.

(f) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all trust accounts required by this article shall be maintained at a branch of a federally insured bank, savings and loan association, or credit union.

The statement shall indicate that the authorization remains in effect as long as the seller of travel, financial institution, or other custodian of records retains records.
(3) A seller of travel shall maintain all business records described in paragraph (2) for a minimum period of three years.
(4) The Attorney General may maintain an action for recovery of examination costs and expenses in any court of competent jurisdiction, and may recover his or her reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as an item of costs, as provided for in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) and paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 1033.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Costs and expenses for an examination under this section shall be paid for by the seller of travel if the Attorney General bills the seller of travel for those costs and expenses, provided that the examination shows that the seller of travel has failed to comply with any requirements of this chapter.
(g) Every seller of travel has a fiduciary responsibility with respect to all sums received for transportation or travel services.
(h) The following are deemed to be held in trust for passengers:

Section 17550.44 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
17550.44.
(a) In addition to the assessments required by Section 17550.43, the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation shall bill and collect from each participant an annual assessment that in the aggregate shall consist of assessments for the operations fund and the restitution fund. For each participant, the due date of that annual assessment shall be 30 days prior to the annual renewal date for registration pursuant to Section 17550.20 or 45 days after billing, whichever is later. For a participant registering for the first time, the assessments required by Section 17550.43 shall be due 10 days prior to the seller of travel doing business in this state. A late fee of five dollars ($5) per day, up to a maximum of five hundred dollars ($500), shall be paid for each day after the due date specified in this section until the assessment is paid.
(b) The annual assessment for the operations fund shall be determined no later than January 15 of each year for the next fiscal year in an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the operations and administration of the corporation, based upon the annual operational budget required by subdivision (a) of Section 17550.43, and shall become effective immediately. The annual assessment for the operations fund shall not exceed thirty-five dollars ($35) per year for each location in the state from which a participant does business.
(c) If, as of January 15 of any year, the balance in the restitution fund is less than one million six hundred thousand dollars ($1,600,000), the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation shall make an assessment of participants, up to a maximum amount of two hundred dollars ($200) for each location in the state from which a participant does business, to bring the restitution fund to an expected balance of one million six hundred thousand dollars ($1,600,000). Every participant’s assessment shall be determined pro rata based upon the ratio of the number of locations in the state from which the participant does business to the total number of locations for all participants as of the preceding December 15.
(d) If, on May 1 or October 15 of any year, the balance in the restitution fund is less than nine hundred thousand dollars ($900,000), the corporation shall make an emergency assessment of participants, not more than twice per year, up to a maximum amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per year for each location in the state from which the participant does business, for deposit in the trust account to return the level of the restitution fund to an expected balance of one million six hundred thousand dollars ($1,600,000). The corporation shall estimate the total cost of billing, collecting, and processing the emergency restitution fund assessment and shall assess and collect, together with the emergency restitution fund assessment, an emergency operations fund assessment that is in the aggregate sufficient to offset the estimated cost. Each participant’s assessments shall be determined pro rata based upon the ratio of the number of locations in the state from which the participant does business to the total number of locations for all participants as of the first day of the preceding month. The board of directors shall adopt rules for the notification of emergency assessments.
(e) In addition to the assessments required by Section 17550.43 and subdivision (d), if at any time during the fiscal year the board of directors of the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation determines that the operations fund will be insufficient to pay the costs of operations and administration for the current or next fiscal year, the corporation, as determined by the board of directors, shall do either or both of the following:
(1) Make an emergency assessment of participants, not more than once per fiscal year, up to a maximum amount of sixty-five dollars ($65) per year for each location in the state from which a participant does business.

(2) Transfer any or all interest earned on the Restitution Fund to the Operations Fund, provided that no transfer results in a restitution fund balance of less than one million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000).
(f) The assessment required by subdivision (d) or (e) shall be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is sent to the seller of travel by the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation. A late fee of five dollars ($5) per day, up to a maximum of five hundred dollars ($500), shall be paid for each day after the due date specified in this section until the assessment is paid.
(g) The Travel Consumer Restitution Fund shall report to the office of the Attorney General each levy of assessment within 10 business days after the levy.","Existing law regulates sellers of travel, as defined, and requires their registration with the Attorney General. Existing law requires a seller of travel to deposit all sums received from any person or entity for air or sea transportation, or for any travel services offered by the seller of travel, and any refunds made by carries or providers of travel services, into a trust account, as specified. Existing law requires the seller of travel to file with the Attorney General an agreement allowing the Attorney General, a district attorney, or their representative to examine and obtain copies of all business records, including, but not limited to, those related to the trust account.
This bill would require the seller of travel to maintain all business records for a minimum period of 3 years. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to maintain an action for recovery of examination costs and expenses in any court of competent jurisdiction, as specified. The bill would require the seller of travel to pay for costs and expenses for any examination if the Attorney General bills the seller of travel, provided that the examination shows that the seller of travel has failed to comply with certain requirements.
Existing law creates the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation, which assesses each registered seller of travel for both its operations and restitution funds. Existing law requires certain assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is mailed.
This bill would instead require those assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is sent to the seller of travel.","An act to amend Sections 17550.15 and 17550.44 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to sellers of travel."

(f) The Energy Commission may verify environmental and procurement claims made by retail suppliers.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act or because costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, entities offering electric services in California are required to disclose information on the sources of energy that are used to provide electric services. Existing law requires every retail supplier, as defined, that makes an offer to sell electricity that is consumed in California to disclose its electricity sources for the previous calendar year. These disclosures are required to be made to end-use consumers and potential end-use consumers. Existing law requires a retail supplier to disclose its electricity sources as a percentage of annual sales that is derived from specified sources of energy, including eligible renewable energy resources. Existing law requires that retail suppliers annually report to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) certain information for each electricity offering from “specified sources,” as defined, for the previous calendar year and authorizes the Energy Commission to verify environmental claims made by retail suppliers.
This bill would, among other things, require the Energy Commission, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, to adopt a methodology for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions intensity for each purchase of electricity by a retail supplier to serve its retail customers. The bill would require a retail supplier, including an electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, electric service provider, and community choice aggregator, to also disclose both the greenhouse gases emissions intensity of any electricity portfolio offered to its retail customers, as specified, and the Energy Commission’s calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with all statewide retail electricity sales. The bill would require a retail supplier to annually report to the Energy Commission certain additional information for each electricity offering for the previous calendar year and would authorize the Energy Commission to verify procurement claims, in addition to environmental claims, made by retail suppliers. The bill would require the Energy Commission, on or before January 1, 2018, to adopt guidelines, through an open process, subject to public comment, and adopted by a vote of the Energy Commission, for the reporting and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions intensity. The bill would require retail suppliers, beginning June 1, 2020, to report data on greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with retail sales occurring after December 31, 2018, except as provided.
The Public Utilities Act makes any public utility and any corporation other than a public utility guilty of a crime, if the public utility or corporation violates the act or fails to comply with any part of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission.
Because the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing its requirements by an electrical corporation or electric service provider would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding what is a crime. By placing additional reporting duties upon local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","An act to amend Sections 398.1, 398.2, 398.4, and 398.5 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

(1) The committee shall consist of six members and the Executive Medical Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation. The committee shall consist of medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy holding a physician and surgeon license pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, and pharmacists licensed pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 4000) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code.

The administrative director is authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal, after public hearings, any rules and regulations that are reasonably necessary to enforce the state workers’ compensation provisions, except when that power is specifically reserved to the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. Existing law requires the administrative director to adopt a medical treatment utilization schedule that addresses the frequency, duration, intensity, and appropriateness of all common treatments performed in workers’ compensation cases.
This bill would require the administrative director to establish a drug formulary, on or before July 1, 2017, as part of the medical treatment utilization schedule, for medications prescribed in the workers’ compensation system.

SECTION 1.
Section 4535.2 of the Government Code is amended to read:
4535.2.
(a)
(1)
The maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to this chapter and any other provision of law shall be 15 percent. However, in no case shall the maximum preference and incentive cost under this chapter exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for any bid, nor shall the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this chapter and any other provision of law exceed one hundred thousand dollars($100,000). In those cases where the 15-percent cumulated preference and incentive cost would exceed the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference and incentive cost limit, the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference and incentive cost limit shall apply.
(2) Notwithstanding the one-hundred-thousand-dollar ($100,000) limitation specified in paragraph (1), if the bid includes preferences or incentives under this chapter and Section 14838, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this chapter and any other law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, small business bidders qualified in accordance with Section 14838 shall have precedence over nonsmall business bidders in that the application of any bidder preference for which nonsmall business bidders may be eligible, including the preference contained in this chapter, shall not result in the denial of the award to a small business bidder. This subdivision shall apply to those cases where the small business bidder is the lowest responsible bidder, as well as to those cases where the small business bidder is eligible for award as the result of application of the 5-percent small business bidder preference and incentive.
SECTION 1.
SEC. 2.
Section 14838 of the Government Code is amended to read:
14838.
In order to facilitate the participation of small business, including microbusiness, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction (including alteration, demolition, repair, or improvement) of state facilities, the directors of the department and other state agencies that enter those contracts, each within their respective areas of responsibility, shall do all of the following:
(a) Establish goals, consistent with those established by the Office of Small Business Certification and Resources, for the extent of participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction of state facilities.
(b) Provide for small business preference, or nonsmall business preference for bidders that provide for small business and microbusiness subcontractor participation, in the award of contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction, as follows:
(1) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, the preference to small business and microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.
(2) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the highest scored bidder based on evaluation factors in addition to price, the preference to small business or microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder’s total score. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be up to a maximum 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder’s total score, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.
(3) The preferences under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be awarded to a noncompliant bidder and shall not be used to achieve any applicable minimum requirements.
(4) The preference under paragraph (1) shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any contract award, and the combined cost of preferences granted pursuant to paragraph (1) and any other provision of law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000). For contract awards in which the state has reserved the right to make multiple awards, this one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) maximum preference cost shall be applied, to the extent possible, so as to maximize the dollar participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the contract award.
(c) Give special consideration to small businesses and microbusinesses by both:
(1) Reducing the experience required.
(2) Reducing the level of inventory normally required.
(d) Give special assistance to small businesses and microbusinesses in the preparation and submission of the information requested in Section 14310.
(e) Under the authorization granted in Section 10163 of the Public Contract Code, make awards, whenever feasible, to small business and microbusiness bidders for each project bid upon within their prequalification rating. This may be accomplished by dividing major projects into subprojects so as to allow a small business or microbusiness contractor to qualify to bid on these subprojects.
(f) Small business and microbusiness bidders qualified in accordance with this chapter shall have precedence over nonsmall business bidders in that the application of a bidder preference for which nonsmall business bidders may be eligible under this section or any other provision of law shall not result in the denial of the award to a small business or microbusiness bidder. In the event of a precise tie between the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting specifications of a small business or microbusiness, and the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting the specifications of a disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness, the contract shall be awarded to the disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness. This provision applies if the small business or microbusiness bidder is the lowest responsible bidder, as well as if the small business or microbusiness bidder is eligible for award as the result of application of the small business and microbusiness bidder preference granted by subdivision (b).
SEC. 3.
Section 42893 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
42893.
(a) The combined amount of preference granted pursuant to this
section
article
shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) each year.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 42892, the recycled tire product preference shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) if a preference exceeding that amount would preclude an award to a small business that offers a similar product made of nonrecycled tire components and is qualified in accordance with Section 14838 of the Government Code. This provision applies regardless of whether the small business is the lowest responsible bidder or is eligible for the contract award on the basis of application of the 5 percent small business preference.
(c) Notwithstanding the one-hundred-thousand-dollar limitation specified in subdivision (a) or the fifty-thousand-dollar ($50,000) limitation specified in subdivision (b), if the bid includes the preference authorized in Section 42891 and Section 14838 of the Government Code, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to this article and any other law shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).","Existing law, the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, provides for various programs to encourage the participation of small businesses, as certified by the Department of General Services, in state agency contracts, including a microbusiness and a disabled veteran business enterprise. Existing law requires directors of state agencies, in awarding prescribed contracts, to provide a 5% preference to small businesses and microbusinesses, and a preference of up to 5% to a nonsmall business that provides for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation, not to exceed prescribed amounts. Existing law provides, in solicitations where an award is made to the lowest responsible bidder, that the preferences shall not exceed $50,000 for any bid and that the combined cost of preferences granted shall not exceed $100,000. Existing law provides that, in bids in which the state has reserved the right to make multiple awards, the $50,000 maximum preference cost shall be applied.
This bill would provide, in solicitations where an award is made to the lowest responsible bidder, that the preference to small business and microbusiness be 5% of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications and that the preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation be up to a maximum of 5% of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder. This bill also would provide that the preference not exceed $100,000 for any contract award and that the combined cost of preferences granted not exceed $150,000. This bill would require that the $100,000 maximum preference cost be applied in multiple contract awards.
Existing law, the Target Area Contract Preference Act, requires, if the contract is for goods or services in excess of $100,000, except as specified, the state to award preferences to California-based companies submitting bids or proposals for state contracts who demonstrate and certify under penalty of perjury that of the total labor hours required to manufacture the goods and perform the contract, at least a specified percentage of the hours will be accomplished at an identified worksite or worksites located in a distressed area by persons with a high risk of unemployment. Existing law also provides that the maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to this act is $50,000 for any bid, and $100,000 for the combined cost of these preferences and incentives and those provided pursuant to any other provision of law.
This bill would instead provide, if the bid includes preferences or incentives provided under the Target Area Contract Preference Act and the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, that the maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to these provisions shall not exceed $150,000 for the combined cost of these preferences and incentives and those provided pursuant to any other provision of law.
Existing law, the California Tire Recycling Act, provides, on state purchases of products that are made of, or contains components that can be derived from the recycling of used tires, to suppliers of recycled tire products, a bid preference of 5% of the lowest bid or price quoted by suppliers offering similar products made from nonrecycled components. That law limits the preference to $100,000 each year, or $50,000 if the preference exceeding that amount would preclude an award to a small business that offers a similar product made of nonrecycled tire components and is qualified in accordance with the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act.
This bill would provide, notwithstanding those limitations, if the bid includes the preference authorized in the California Tire Recycling Act and the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to California Tire Recycling Act and any other law is not to exceed $150,000.","An act to amend
Section
Sections 4535.2 and
14838 of the Government Code,
and to amend Section 42893 of the Public Resources Code,
relating to public contracts."
730,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The State of California has long recognized the mental health needs of California’s children and the value of addressing these needs by supporting the provision of evidence-based mental health services in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools, as evidenced by the creation in 1981 of the Primary Prevention Project, now named the Primary Intervention Program, and the creation in 1991 of the School-based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Program, known as the Early Mental Health Initiative (EMHI).
(b) From the 1992–93 fiscal year to the 2011–12 fiscal year, the State Department of Mental Health awarded funds each year in matching grants to local education agencies to fund prevention and early intervention programs, including the Primary Intervention Program, for students experiencing mild to moderate school adjustment difficulty through the EMHI. In the 2011–12 fiscal year, the EMHI received $15 million in state funds.
(c) Authorizing legislation specified that the EMHI would be deemed successful if at least 75 percent of the children who complete the program show an improvement in at least one of the following four areas: learning behaviors, attendance, school adjustment, and school-related competencies.
(d) The EMHI succeeded in meeting these legislative requirements. According to the 2010/2011 Early Mental Health Initiative Statewide Evaluation Report, of the 15,823 students located in 424 elementary schools across 66 school districts participating in EMHI-funded services during the 2010–11 school year, 79 percent exhibited positive social competence and school adjustment behaviors more frequently after completing services. Furthermore, the magnitude of the improvements was exceptional in comparison to evaluations of other programs, especially given the short-term and cost-effective nature of the intervention.
(e) The 2010/2011 Early Mental Health Initiative Statewide Evaluation Report described an unmet demand for EMHI-funded services at participating schoolsites, as only 37 percent of the students that scored in the mild to moderate school adjustment difficulty range were served with EMHI-funded services due to program capacity and funding constraints. Based on demographic considerations, similar demand would be expected at schools that did not receive EMHI grants.
(f) The Governor’s realignment for the 2011–12 fiscal year renamed the State Department of Mental Health as the State Department of State Hospitals and limited that department’s mission.
(g) The Budget Act of 2012 disbursed Proposition 98 funds, which had been used to fund the EMHI, directly to local education agencies in order to provide local schools with enhanced flexibility to manage their finances and give greater control of local decisions.
(h) It is in the interest of California’s children, families, schools, and communities that the State of California support local decisions to provide funding for evidence-based services to address the mental health needs of children in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools.
(i) Multitiered systems and supports have been developed as model framework within which to implement these services. Pilot programs in the Counties of San Bernardino and Alameda are demonstrating that implementing these services as part of a multitiered system is cost effective, because the cost of the services is more than fully offset by the reduction in the need for high-cost nonpublic school placements.
SEC. 2.
Section 4372 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
4372.
For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “Cooperating entity” means any federal, state, or local, public or private nonprofit agency providing school-based early mental health intervention and prevention services that agrees to offer services at a schoolsite through a program assisted under this part.
(b) “Eligible pupil” means a pupil who attends a preschool program at a publicly funded elementary school, or who attends a publicly funded elementary school and who is in kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or grades 1 to 3, inclusive.
(c) “Local educational agency” means any school district or county office of education, state special school, or charter school.
(d) “Department” means the State Department of Public Health.
(e) “Director” means the State Director of Mental Health.
(f) “Supportive service” means a service that will enhance the mental health and social development of children.
SEC. 3.
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4391) is added to Part 4 of Division 4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
CHAPTER  4. School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Support Program

(A) Individual and group intervention and prevention services.
(B) Parent involvement through conference or training, or both.
(C) Teacher and staff conferences and training related to meeting project goals.
(D) Referral to outside resources when eligible pupils require additional services.
(E) Use of paraprofessional staff, who are trained and supervised by credentialed school psychologists, school counselors, or school social workers, to meet with pupils on a short-term weekly basis, in a one-on-one setting as in the primary intervention program established pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4343) of Part 3.
(F) Any other service or activity that will improve the mental health of eligible pupils.
(2) The potential for the eligible support services defined in this section to help fulfill state priorities described by the local control funding formula and local goals described by local control and accountability plans.
(3) How educational, mental health, and other funds subject to local control can be used to finance the eligible support services defined in this section.
(4) External resources available to support the eligible support services defined in this section, which may include workshops, training, conferences, and peer learning networks.
(5) State resources available to support student mental health and positive learning environments, which may include any of the following:
(A) Foundational aspects of learning, mental health, toxic stress, childhood trauma, and adverse childhood experiences.
(B) Inclusive multitiered systems of behavioral and academic supports, Schoolwide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports, restorative justice or restorative practices, trauma-informed practices, social and emotional learning, and bullying prevention.
(d) The department shall provide technical assistance to local education agencies that provide or seek to provide eligible services defined in this section. Technical assistance shall include assistance in any of the following:
(1) Designing programs.
(2) Training program staff in intervention skills.
(3) Conducting local evaluations.
(4) Leveraging educational, mental health, and other funds that are subject to local control and assisting in budget development.
(e) In providing outreach pursuant to subdivision (b), training pursuant to subdivision (c), and technical assistance pursuant to subdivision (d), the department shall select and support schoolsites as follows:
(1) During the first 18 months of the program, the department shall support, strengthen, and expand the provision of eligible services at 30 schoolsites that previously received funding pursuant to the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Matching Grant Program (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 4380)) and have continued to provide eligible support services. In working with these selected schoolsites, the department shall develop methods and standards for providing services and practices to new schoolsites.
(2) During the subsequent 18 months of the program, the department shall select 30 new schoolsites that are not providing eligible support services but that demonstrate the willingness and capacity to participate in the program. The department shall work with these schoolsites to deliver eligible support services.
(3) In selecting schoolsites and providing support, the department shall prioritize geographic diversity, program effectiveness, program efficiency, and long-term program sustainability.
(f) The department shall submit, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, an interim report to the Legislature at the end of the second year of the pilot program that details the department’s work to support the schoolsites selected pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) and includes an assessment of the demand and impact of funding for the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Matching Grant Program established pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 4390). The department shall make the report available to the public and shall post it on the department’s Internet Web site.
(g) The department shall develop an evaluation plan to assess the impact of the pilot program. The department, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, shall submit a report to the Legislature at the end of the four-year period evaluating the impact of the pilot program and providing recommendations for further implementation. The department shall make the report available to the public and shall post it on the department’s Internet Web site.
4392.
This chapter shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law, the School-based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Act of 1991, authorizes the Director of Health Care Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to provide matching grants to local educational agencies to pay the state share of the costs of providing school-based early mental health intervention and prevention services to eligible pupils at schoolsites of eligible pupils, subject to the availability of funding each year. Existing law defines “eligible pupil” for this purpose as a pupil who attends a publicly funded elementary school and who is in kindergarten or grades 1 to 3, inclusive. Existing law also defines “local educational agency” as a school district or county office of education or a state special school.
This bill would expand the definition of an eligible pupil to include a pupil who attends a state preschool program at a publicly funded elementary school and a pupil who is in transitional kindergarten, thereby extending the application of the act to those persons. The bill would also include charter schools in the definition of local educational agency, thereby extending the application of the act to those entities. The bill would require the State Public Health Officer, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Schools and the Director of Health Care Services, to establish a 4-year pilot program, the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Support Program, to provide outreach, free regional training, and technical assistance for local educational agencies in providing mental health services at schoolsites. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to submit specified reports after 2 and 4 years. The bill would repeal these provisions as of January 1, 2021.","An act to amend Section 4372 of, and to add and repeal Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 4391) of Part 4 of Division 4 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health."

Section 30515 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
30515.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 30510, “assault weapon” also means any of the following:
(1) A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of the following:

(2) Except as provided in Section 30600, any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon pursuant to former Section 12276.1, as it read in Section 7 of Chapter 129 of the Statutes of 1999, and which was not specified as an assault weapon under former Section 12276, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989 or as amended at any time before January 1, 2001, or former Section 12276.5, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989 or as amended at any time before January 1, 2001, shall register the firearm by January 1, 2001, with the department pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish.
(3) The registration shall contain a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely, including all identification marks, the full name, address, date of birth, and thumbprint of the owner, and any other information that the department may deem appropriate.
(4) The department may charge a fee for registration of up to twenty dollars ($20) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. After the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, fees charged shall increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act but not to exceed the reasonable costs of the department. The fees shall be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account.
(b) (1) Any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined in Section 30515, including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be readily removed from the firearm with the use of a tool, shall register the firearm before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (5), with the department pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish by regulation pursuant to paragraph (5).
(2) Registrations shall be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department.
(3) The registration shall contain a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely, including all identification marks, the date the firearm was acquired, the name and address of the individual from whom, or business from which, the firearm was acquired, as well as the registrant’s full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, sex, height, weight, eye color, hair color, and California driver’s license number or California identification card number.
(4) The department may charge a fee in an amount of up to fifteen dollars ($15) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The fee shall be paid by debit or credit card at the time that the electronic registration is submitted to the department. The fee shall be deposited in the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account to be used for purposes of this section.
(5) The department shall adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing this subdivision. These regulations are exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of several specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a 2nd handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires that any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, be punished as a felony or for a period not to exceed one year in a county jail.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that provision a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined, and including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 30515 and 30900 of, and to add Section 30680 to, the Penal Code, relating to firearms."
732,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
399.16.
(a) Various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources located within the WECC transmission network service area shall be eligible to comply with the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements in Section 399.15. These electricity products may be differentiated by their impacts on the operation of the grid in supplying electricity, as well as, meeting the requirements of this article.
(b) Consistent with the goals of procuring the least-cost and best-fit electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources that meet project viability principles adopted by the commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 399.13 and that provide the benefits set forth in Section 399.11, a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources shall be procured consisting of the following portfolio content categories:
(1) Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products that meet any of the following criteria:
(A) Have a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, have a first point of interconnection with distribution facilities used to serve end users within a California balancing authority area, or are scheduled from the eligible renewable energy resource into a California balancing authority without substituting electricity from another source. The use of another source to provide real-time ancillary services required to maintain an hourly or subhourly import schedule into a California balancing authority shall be permitted, but only the fraction of the schedule actually generated by the eligible renewable energy resource shall count toward this portfolio content category.
(B) Have an agreement to dynamically transfer electricity to a California balancing authority.
(C)
Unbundled renewable
Renewable
energy credits that are earned by electricity that is generated by an entity that, if it were a person or corporation, would be excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation by operation of subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 218,
that meets the criteria of subparagraph (A), and where the electricity generated that earned the credit is used at a wastewater treatment facility that is owned by a public entity and first put into service on or after January 1, 2016.
consistent with the following requirements:
(i) The generating facility earning the renewable energy credit meets the criteria of subparagraph (A).
(ii) The electricity generated that earned the renewable energy credit is used at a wastewater treatment facility that is owned by a public entity.
(iii) The generating capability of the wastewater treatment facility that earned the renewable energy credit is first put into service on or after January 1, 2016. For these purposes, “generating capability” includes new or additional generation of electricity at a wastewater treatment facility that is the result of capital investment or operational changes made to the facility on or after January 1, 2016, that result in incremental increases in generation at the facility, as well as repowered wastewater facilities.
(iv) The wastewater treatment facility does not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program established by the commission pursuant to Section 399.20.
(2) Firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products providing incremental electricity and scheduled into a California balancing authority.
(3) Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products, or any fraction of the electricity generated, including unbundled renewable energy credits, that do not qualify under the criteria of paragraph (1) or (2).
(c) In order to achieve a balanced portfolio, all retail sellers shall meet the following requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period:
(1) Not less than 50 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 65 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2016, and 75 percent thereafter of the eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010, shall meet the product content requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).
(2) Not more than 25 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 15 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2016, and 10 percent thereafter of the eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010, shall meet the product content requirements of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b).
(3) Any renewable energy resources contracts executed on or after June 1, 2010, not subject to the limitations of paragraph (1) or (2), shall meet the product content requirements of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).
(4) For purposes of electric service providers only, the restrictions in this subdivision on crediting eligible renewable energy resource electricity products to each compliance period shall apply to contracts executed after January 13, 2011.
(d) Any contract or ownership agreement originally executed prior to June 1, 2010, shall count in full toward the procurement requirements established pursuant to this article, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The renewable energy resource was eligible under the rules in place as of the date when the contract was executed.
(2) For an electrical corporation, the contract has been approved by the commission, even if that approval occurs after June 1, 2010.
(3) Any contract amendments or modifications occurring after June 1, 2010, do not increase the nameplate capacity or expected quantities of annual generation, or substitute a different renewable energy resource. The duration of the contract may be extended if the original contract specified a procurement commitment of 15 or more years.
(e) A retail seller may apply to the commission for a reduction of a procurement content requirement of subdivision (c). The commission may reduce a procurement content requirement of subdivision (c) to the extent the retail seller demonstrates that it cannot comply with that subdivision because of conditions beyond the control of the retail seller as provided in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 399.15. The commission shall not, under any circumstance, reduce the obligation specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) below 65 percent for any compliance obligation after December 31, 2016.
(f) (1) A public entity selling renewable energy credits that are eligible for treatment pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) shall not make any marketing or advertising claims regarding the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the renewable energy credit. All renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the renewable energy credit are transferred to the purchaser of the renewable energy credit.
(2) For purposes of calculating the renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations for a retail seller pursuant to Section 399.15, and for a local publicly owned electric utility pursuant to Section 399.30, the electricity generated that earned the renewable energy credit that is eligible for treatment pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and is sold by the public entity shall be added to the total retail sales of the retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility that purchases the renewable energy credit.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The existing definition of an electrical corporation excludes from that definition a corporation or person employing landfill gas technology or digester gas technology for the generation of electricity for (1) its own use or the use of not more than 2 of its tenants located on the real property on which the electricity is generated, (2) the use of or sale to not more than 2 other corporations or persons solely for use on the real property on which the electricity is generated, or (3) the sale or transmission to an electrical corporation or state or local public agency, if the sale or transmission of the electricity service to a retail customer is provided through the transmission system of the existing local publicly owned electric utility or electrical corporation of that retail customer.
The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-customers during specified compliance periods. The program additionally requires each local publicly owned electric utility, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to achieve the targets established by the program. The program, consistent with the goals of procuring the least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources that meet project viability principles, requires that all retail sellers procure a balanced portfolio of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as specified, referred to as the portfolio content requirements.
Existing law requires every electrical corporation to file with the commission a standard tariff for electricity generated by an electric generation facility, as defined, that qualifies for the tariff, is owned and operated by a retail customer of the electrical corporation, and is located within the service territory of, and developed to sell electricity to, the electrical corporation. This tariff requirement is known as the renewable feed-in tariff program. The program additionally requires the commission, by June 1, 2013, to direct the electrical corporations to collectively procure at least 250 megawatts of cumulative rated generating capacity from developers of bioenergy projects that commence operation on or after June 1, 2013. Pursuant to this requirement, the commission has established the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program.
This bill would provide that
unbundled
renewable energy credits may be used to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements if (1) the credits are earned by electricity that is generated by an entity that, if it were a person or corporation, would be excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation by operation of the exclusions for a corporation or person employing landfill gas technology or digester gas technology, (2) the entity employing the landfill gas technology or digester gas technology has a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, a first point of interconnection with distribution facilities used to serve end users within a California balancing authority area, or
are
is
scheduled from the eligible renewable energy resource into a California balancing authority without substituting electricity from another source,
and
(3) where the electricity generated that earned the credit is used at a wastewater treatment facility that is owned by a public
entity and
entity, (4) the generating capability, as specified, of the wastewater treatment facility that earned the renewable energy credit is
first put into service on or after January 1,
2016.
2016, and (5) the wastewater treatment facility does not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. The bill would prohibit a public entity, selling renewable energy that is eligible to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements pursuant to the bill’s provisions, from making any marketing or advertising claims regarding the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the renewable energy credit. The bill would require that the electricity generated that earned the renewable energy credit that is sold by the public entity be added to the total retail sales of the retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility purchasing the renewable energy credit for purposes of determining their renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements.","An act to amend Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

SEC. 2.
Section 40215 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
40215.
(a) For a period of 21 calendar days from the issuance of a notice of parking violation or 14 calendar days from the mailing of a notice of delinquent parking violation, exclusive of any days from the day the processing agency receives a request for a copy or facsimile of the original notice of parking violation pursuant to Section 40206.5 and the day the processing agency complies with the request, a person may request an initial review of the notice by the issuing agency. The request may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. There shall be no charge for this review. If, following the initial review, the issuing agency is satisfied that the violation did not occur, that the registered owner was not responsible for the violation, or that extenuating circumstances make dismissal of the citation appropriate in the interest of justice, the issuing agency shall cancel the notice of parking violation or notice of delinquent parking violation. The issuing agency shall advise the processing agency, if any, of the cancellation. The issuing agency or the processing agency shall mail the results of the initial review to the person contesting the notice, and, if following that review, cancellation of the notice does not occur, include a reason for that denial, notification of the ability to request an administrative hearing, and notice of the procedure adopted pursuant to subdivision (b) for waiving prepayment of the parking penalty based upon an inability to pay.
(b) If the person is dissatisfied with the results of the initial review, the person may request an administrative hearing of the violation no later than 21 calendar days following the mailing of the results of the issuing agency’s initial review. The request may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. The person requesting an administrative hearing shall deposit the amount of the parking penalty with the processing agency.

If an issuing agency contracts with an administrative provider, hearings shall be held within the jurisdiction of the issuing agency or within the county of the issuing agency.
(2) If the person requesting a hearing is a minor, that person shall be permitted to appear at a hearing or admit responsibility for the parking violation without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may proceed against the minor in the same manner as against an adult.
(3) The administrative hearing shall be conducted in accordance with written procedures established by the issuing agency and approved by the governing body or chief executive officer of the issuing agency. The hearing shall provide an independent, objective, fair, and impartial review of contested parking violations.
(4) (A) The issuing agency’s governing body or chief executive officer shall appoint or contract with qualified examiners or administrative hearing providers that employ qualified examiners to conduct the administrative hearings. Examiners shall demonstrate those qualifications, training, and objectivity necessary to conduct a fair and impartial review. An examiner shall not be employed, managed, or controlled by a person whose primary duties are parking enforcement or parking citation, processing, collection, or issuance. The examiner shall be separate and independent from the citation collection or processing function. An examiner’s continued employment, performance evaluation, compensation, and benefits shall not, directly or indirectly, be linked to the amount of fines collected by the examiner.
(B) Examiners shall have a minimum of 20 hours of training. The examiner is responsible for the costs of the training. The issuing agency may reimburse the examiner for those costs. Training may be provided through (i) an accredited college or university, (ii) a program conducted by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, (iii) American Arbitration Association or a similar established organization, or (iv) through any program approved by the governing board of the issuing agency, including a program developed and provided by, or for, the agency. Training programs may include topics relevant to the administrative hearing, including, but not limited to, applicable laws and regulations, parking enforcement procedures, due process, evaluation of evidence, hearing procedures, and effective oral and written communication. Upon the approval of the governing board of the issuing agency, up to 12 hours of relevant experience may be substituted for up to 12 hours of training. In addition, up to eight hours of the training requirements described in this subparagraph may be credited to an individual, at the discretion of the governing board of the issuing agency, based upon training programs or courses described in (i) to (iv), inclusive, that the individual attended within the last five years.
(5) The officer or person who issues a notice of parking violation shall not be required to participate in an administrative hearing. The issuing agency shall not be required to produce any evidence other than the notice of parking violation or copy thereof and information received from the Department of Motor Vehicles identifying the registered owner of the vehicle.

(7) The examiner or the issuing agency may, at any stage of the initial review or the administrative hearing process, and consistent with the written guidelines established by the issuing agency, allow payment of the parking penalty in installments, or the issuing agency may allow for deferred payment, if the person provides evidence satisfactory to the examiner or the issuing agency, as the case may be, of an inability to pay the parking penalty in full. If authorized by the governing board of the issuing agency, the examiner may permit the performance of community service in lieu of payment of a parking penalty.
(d) The provisions of this section relating to the administrative appeal process do not apply to an issuing agency that is a law enforcement agency if the issuing agency does not also act as the processing agency.","Existing law establishes a process by which a person who has received a notice of a parking violation or a notice of a delinquent parking violation may contest the notice. Existing law provides for an administrative hearing, conducted by an examiner, as specified, as part of that process. If after the hearing the examiner determines that the person committed the violation, existing law authorizes the examiner to allow the person to pay the penalty for the violation in installments, and authorizes the agency that issued the notice to allow deferred payment of the penalty or payment of the penalty in installments if the person provides satisfactory evidence of an inability to pay the penalty in full.
This bill would authorize the examiner or the issuing agency to allow payment of the penalty in installments, or allow the issuing agency to allow deferred payment of the penalty, at any stage of the process described above. This bill would also authorize the issuing agency to allow payment of the penalty in installments if the person does not contest the violation.","An act to amend Sections 40204 and 40215 of the Vehicle Code, relating to parking violations."

(2) A governmental agency that is operating an automated traffic enforcement system on January 1, 2016, may continue to operate the automated traffic enforcement system after that date only if the agency begins conducting, on or before February 28, 2016, a traffic safety study at each intersection where an automated traffic enforcement system is in use to determine whether the use of the system resulted in a
statistically significant
reduction in the number of traffic accidents
when the primary collision factor was a violation of subdivision (a) or (c) of Section 21453
at that intersection.
The traffic study shall also determine whether rear-end collisions occurring within 100 feet of the intersection have increased. The methodology of the traffic safety study shall account for factors other than the automated traffic enforcement system that could have caused any reduction in red-light running, including, but not limited to, engineering countermeasures employed at the intersection, changes in traffic volume, effects of weather, collisions caused by impairment, statistical regression to the mean, and overall trends in red-light running collision rates. The study shall use, at a minimum, three years of data collected before the installation of the automated traffic enforcement system, and the entire period after installation, up to the date the study commences, if that data is available, and shall adjust for any differences between the two periods.
The traffic safety study shall be conducted according to standards consistent with the analysis of data approved by the federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for automated traffic enforcement systems.
All raw data used for, and referenced in, the study shall be clearly listed within the study to allow peer review. The study shall be completed on or before January 1, 2017.

shows
does not definitively show
that the use of an automated traffic enforcement system
did not reduce
reduced
the number of traffic accidents
caused by red-light running
that occurred at an intersection
equipped with an automated traffic enforcement system by a statistically significant number, or the study shows that there was an increase in rear-end collisions
, the governmental agency shall terminate the use of the system at that intersection no later than January 1,
2018.
2018, and no violation captured by the system after that date shall be used for prosecution.
(4) If the governmental agency uses an automated traffic enforcement system to cite motorists for right-turn violations, the agency shall, using the same criteria listed in paragraph (2), include in the study, an analysis of collisions caused by motorists’ failure to stop before turning right on a red light in violation of subdivision (a) or (c) of Section 21453. If the traffic safety study does not definitively show that the use of the automated traffic enforcement system reduced the number of traffic accidents caused by motorists’ failure to stop before turning right on a red light in violation of subdivision (a) or (c) of Section 21453 at an intersection equipped with an automated traffic enforcement system by a statistically significant number, the governmental agency shall terminate the use of the system to cite motorists for right turn violations at that intersection on or before January 1, 2018, and no violation captured by the system after that date shall be used for prosecution.","Existing law authorizes the limit line, intersection, or other places where a driver is required to stop to be equipped with an automated traffic enforcement system, as defined, if the system meets certain requirements. Existing law authorizes a governmental agency to contract out the operation of the system under certain circumstances, except for specified activities, that include, among other things, establishing guidelines for selection of the location of the system.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2016, prohibit a governmental agency from installing an automated traffic enforcement system. The bill would authorize a governmental agency that is operating an automatic traffic enforcement system on that date to continue to do so after that date only if the agency begins conducting a traffic safety study on or before February 28, 2016, at each intersection where a system is in use to determine whether the use of the system resulted in a reduction in the number of traffic accidents
involving failing to stop at a red light or failing to stop at a red light when making a right turn
at that intersection.
The bill would require the traffic safety study to be completed on or before January 1, 2017.
The bill would require the governmental agency to terminate the use of an automated traffic enforcement system at an intersection no later than January 1, 2018, if the traffic safety study shows that the use of the system did not reduce the number of traffic accidents that occurred at that intersection
by a statistically significant number

SECTION 1.
Section 51225.1 of the Education Code is amended to read:
51225.1.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a school district shall exempt a pupil in foster care, as defined in Section 51225.2, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, as defined in Section 11434a(2) of Title 42 of the United States Code, who transfers between schools any time after the completion of the pupil’s second year of high school from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the governing board of the school district that are in addition to the statewide coursework requirements specified in Section 51225.3, unless the school district makes a finding that the pupil is reasonably able to complete the school district’s graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the pupil’s fourth year of high school.
(b) If the school district determines that the pupil in foster care, or the pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is reasonably able to complete the school district’s graduation requirements within the pupil’s fifth year of high school, the school district shall do all of the following:
(1) Inform the pupil of his or her option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the school district’s graduation requirements.
(2) Inform the pupil, and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil, about how remaining in school for a fifth year to complete the school district’s graduation requirements will affect the pupil’s ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution.

(4) Permit the pupil to stay in school for a fifth year to complete the school district’s graduation requirements upon agreement with the pupil, if the pupil is 18 years of age or older, or, if the pupil is under 18 years of age, upon agreement with the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil.
(c) To determine whether a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is in the third or fourth year of high school, either the number of credits the pupil has earned to the date of transfer or the length of the pupil’s school enrollment may be used, whichever will qualify the pupil for the exemption.
(d) (1) (A) Within 30 calendar days of the date that a pupil in foster care who may qualify for the exemption from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section transfers into a school, the school district shall notify the pupil, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil, and the pupil’s social worker, of the availability of the exemption and whether the pupil qualifies for an exemption.
(B) If the school district fails to provide timely notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the pupil described in subparagraph (A) shall be eligible for the exemption from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section once notified, even if that notification occurs after the termination of the court’s jurisdiction over the pupil, if the pupil otherwise qualifies for the exemption pursuant to this section.
(2) (A) Within 30 calendar days of the date that a pupil who is a homeless child or youth may qualify for the exemption from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section transfers into a school, the school district shall notify the pupil, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil, and the local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youth designated pursuant to Section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of Title 42 of the United States Code, of the availability of the exemption and whether the pupil qualifies for an exemption.
(B) If the school district fails to provide timely notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the pupil described in subparagraph (A) shall be eligible for the exemption from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section once notified, even if that notification occurs after the pupil is no longer a homeless child or youth, if the pupil otherwise qualifies for the exemption pursuant to this section.
(e) If a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is exempted from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section and completes the statewide coursework requirements specified in Section 51225.3 before the end of his or her fourth year in high school and that pupil would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school, a school or school district shall not require or request that the pupil graduate before the end of his or her fourth year of high school.
(f) If a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is exempted from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section, the school district shall notify the pupil and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil how any of the requirements that are waived will affect the pupil’s ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution and shall provide information about transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges.
(g) A pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, who is eligible for the exemption from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section and would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school shall not be required to accept the exemption or be denied enrollment in, or the ability to complete, courses for which he or she is otherwise eligible, including courses necessary to attend an institution of higher education, regardless of whether those courses are required for statewide graduation requirements.
(h) If a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is not exempted from local graduation requirements or has previously declined the exemption pursuant to this section, a school district shall exempt the pupil at any time if an exemption is requested by the pupil and the pupil qualifies for the exemption.
(i) If a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, is exempted from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section, a school district shall not revoke the exemption.
(j) (1) If a pupil in foster care is exempted from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section, the exemption shall continue to apply after the termination of the court’s jurisdiction over the pupil while he or she is enrolled in school or if the pupil transfers to another school or school district.
(2) If a pupil who is a homeless child or youth is exempted from local graduation requirements pursuant to this section, the exemption shall continue to apply after the pupil is no longer a homeless child or youth while he or she is enrolled in school or if the pupil transfers to another school or school district.
(k) A school district shall not require or request a pupil in foster care, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, to transfer schools in order to qualify the pupil for an exemption pursuant to this section.
(l) (1) A pupil in foster care, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil, the pupil’s social worker, or the pupil’s probation officer shall not request a transfer solely to qualify the pupil for an exemption pursuant to this section.
(2) A pupil who is a homeless child or youth, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil, or the local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youth designated pursuant to Section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of Title 42 of the United States Code, shall not request a transfer solely to qualify the pupil for an exemption pursuant to this section.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires a school district, except as provided, to exempt a pupil in foster care, as defined, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, as defined, who transfers between schools any time after the completion of the pupil’s 2nd year of high school from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the governing board of the school district that are in addition to certain statewide coursework requirements. Existing law requires the school district to notify specified individuals, including a pupil in foster care or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, within 30 calendar days of the date that a pupil who may qualify for the exemption from local graduation requirements transfers into a school, of the availability of the exemption and whether the pupil qualifies for an exemption.
This bill would, if the school district fails to provide that notification, declare the effected pupil eligible for the exemption from local graduation requirements once notified, even if that notification is received after the termination of the court’s jurisdiction over the pupil or after the pupil is no longer a homeless child or youth, as applicable, if the pupil otherwise qualifies for the exemption.
Existing law requires, if a pupil in foster care is exempted from local graduation requirements, that the exemption continue to apply after the termination of the court’s jurisdiction over the pupil while he or she is enrolled in school or if the pupil transfers to another school or school district.
This bill would require, if a pupil who is a homeless child or youth is exempted from local graduation requirements, that the exemption continue to apply after the pupil is no longer a homeless child or youth while he or she is enrolled in school or if the pupil transfers to another school or school district.
By requiring school districts to perform additional duties in complying with the exemption requirement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 51225.1 of the Education Code, relating to pupils."

This bill would authorize regional transportation agencies, as defined, to use the Construction Manager/General Contractor project delivery method, as specified, to design and construct certain expressways that are not on the state highway system if: (1) the expressways are developed in accordance with an expenditure plan approved by voters, (2) there is an evaluation of the traditional design-bid-build method of construction and of the Construction Manager/General Contractor method, and (3) the board of the regional transportation agency adopts the method in a public meeting. The bill would require the regional transportation agency to provide a report, containing specified information, to its governing body upon completion of a project using the Construction Manager/General Contractor method. The bill would require specified information provided to a regional transportation agency to be verified under oath. By expanding the scope of the existing crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

(2) Many handguns have a value of less than nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). The threat to public safety in regard to stolen firearms goes above and beyond the monetary value of the firearm.

(b) It is not the intent of the Legislature in submitting this act to the electors to undermine the voter’s decision to decrease penalties for low-level theft and receiving stolen property, only to give the voters the opportunity to decide whether firearm thefts and the receipt of stolen firearms should be subject to the penalties that existed prior to the passage of the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act.

The court, on forms prescribed by the Department of Justice, shall notify the department of persons subject to this section. However, the prohibition in this section may be reduced, eliminated, or conditioned as provided in Section 29855 or 29860.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 6.
(a) Sections 2 and 3 of this act amend the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, Proposition 47, an initiative statute, and shall become effective only when submitted to and approved by the voters at a statewide election.
(b) A special election is hereby called, to be held throughout the state on November 8, 2016, for approval by the voters of Sections 2 and 3 of this act. The special election shall be consolidated with the statewide general election to be held on that date. The consolidated election shall be held and conducted in all respects as if there were only one election, and only one form of ballot shall be used.
(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 9040, 9043, 9044, 9061, 9082, and 9094 of the Elections Code, or any other law, the Secretary of State shall submit Sections 2 and 3 of this act to the voters for their approval at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.
SEC. 7.
This act calls an election within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","(1) The existing Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted as an initiative statute by Proposition 47, as approved by the electors at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, makes the theft of property that does not exceed $950 in value petty theft, and makes that crime punishable as a misdemeanor, with certain exceptions.
The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to amend an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.
This bill would amend that initiative statute by making the theft of a firearm grand theft in all cases and punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years.
(2) Under existing law, a person who buys or receives property that has been stolen, knowing the property to be stolen, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding property from the owner, knowing the property to be stolen, is guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony, except that if the value of the property does not exceed $950, Proposition 47 makes the offense punishable as a misdemeanor if the defendant has not previously been convicted of one or more specified serious or violent felonies or an offense requiring registration as a sex offender.
This bill would amend that initiative statute by making the buying or receiving of a stolen firearm, with knowledge that the property was stolen, or the concealing, selling, withholding, or aiding in concealing, selling, or withholding of a firearm, with knowledge that the property was stolen, a misdemeanor or a felony.
(3) Existing law generally prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain misdemeanors from possessing a firearm within 10 years of the conviction. Under existing law, a violation of this prohibition is a crime, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine.
This bill would add to the list of misdemeanors, the conviction for which is subject to the above prohibition on possessing a firearm within 10 years of the conviction, the petty theft of a firearm and the buying, receiving, concealing, selling, withholding, or aiding in concealing, selling, or withholding, of stolen property consisting of a firearm, as specified. Because a violation of this provision would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would call a special election to be consolidated with the November 8, 2016, statewide general election. This bill would require the Secretary of State to submit the provisions of the bill that amend the initiative statute, as described in (1) and (2) above, to the electors for their approval at the November 8, 2016, consolidated election.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an act calling an election.","An act to amend Sections 490.2, 496, and 29805 of the Penal Code, relating to theft, and calling an election, to take effect immediately."

SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the need to establish a pilot project for the Los Angeles Unified School District to determine the potential benefits and consequences of using best value procurement to facilitate infrastructure improvements and ease fiscal impacts.","The Local Agency Public Construction Act requires the governing board of any school district to let any contract for a public project, as defined, involving an expenditure of $15,000 or more, to the lowest responsible bidder that gives security as the board requires, or else reject all bids.
This bill would establish a pilot program to authorize the Los Angeles Unified School District to use, before December 31, 2020, a best value procurement method for bid evaluation and selection for public projects that exceed $1,000,000. The bill would establish various requirements applicable to the use of the best value procurement method under this authorization. The bill would require the school district to submit an interim and final report to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature on the use of the best value procurement method pursuant to the bill, in accordance with a specified schedule. These provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2021.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Los Angeles Unified School District.","An act to add and repeal Article 3.3 (commencing with Section 20119) of Chapter 1 of Part 3 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code, relating to best value procurement."

(a)Low carbon transportation fuels are an important element of the state’s greenhouse gas reduction policy and increasing the supply of those fuels will help the state achieve its greenhouse gas reduction goals.
(b)Existing incentives for the development of low carbon transportation fuels, including the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations), the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code), and Assembly Bill 118 (Chapter 750 of the Statutes of 2007), have not resulted in sufficient development of low carbon transportation fuels.
SEC. 2.
Section 38568 is added to the
Health and Safety Code
, to read:
38568.
(a)For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1)“Indirect land use change emission” means the carbon emissions associated with changes in agricultural activity that result from the market-mediated effects of using an agricultural commodity that is a food product as feedstock for the production of the transportation fuel.
(2)“Very low carbon transportation fuel” means a liquid or gaseous transportation fuel having no greater than 50 percent of the carbon intensity of the closest comparable petroleum fuel for that year, as measured by the methodology in the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations). The carbon intensity for the transportation fuel shall include the indirect land use change emission if an agricultural commodity that is a food product is used as a feedstock for the production of the transportation fuel.
(b)The state board may establish a very low carbon fuel market commitment program that requires a wholesaler, producer, importer, or any other entity that provides transportation fuel to a retailer or sells transportation fuel to a consumer to include as part of its transportation fuel sales in the state percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel. The percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel shall be determined by the state board and measured in energy equivalent units. The state board may require percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel as low as one-quarter of 1 percent or as high as 2 percent.
(c)When the state board determines that very low carbon transportation fuel sales have reached 2 percent of all transportation fuel sales in the state, the state board shall notify the Secretary of State and this section shall be inoperative five years from that notification.
(d)This section does not replace or modify any existing fuel standards or requirements imposed under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Article 4 of Subchapter 10 of Chapter 1 of Division 3 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations).","Existing law requires an operator of a commercial Web site or online service that collects personally identifiable information, as defined, through the Internet about individual consumers residing in California to conspicuously post its privacy policy on its Internet Web site, and requires that privacy policy to, among other things, identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects.
This bill would require a person, as defined, that provides a mobile operating system or platform that is used by an operator or developer of a mobile application that collects personal data from an individual California user through the mobile application or an online service to create universal privacy policy standards that are based on certain principles, including, but not limited to, transparency and security. The bill would require that person to conspicuously post those standards on the person’s Internet Web site in a digital format that is accessible to all users, and would require a developer or operator of a mobile application using a mobile operating system or platform to accept those universal privacy policy standards, except as specified. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations regarding those principles.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions levels of 1990. The state board additionally is required to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Pursuant to the act, the state board has adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations.
This bill would authorize the state board to establish a very low carbon fuel market commitment program that requires wholesalers, producers, importers, or any other entity that provides transportation fuel to a retailer or sells transportation fuel to a consumer to include as part of their transportation fuel sales in the state percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel, as defined, as determined by the state board. These provisions would become inoperative 5 years after the state board notifies the Secretary of State that very low carbon fuel sales have reached 2% of all transportation fuel sales in the state.","An act to add Section 38568 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to greenhouse gases.
An act to add Chapter 22.4 (commencing with Section 22595) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to data."

If, in the judgment of the professional person in charge of the facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment, member of the attending staff, or professional person designated by the county, the person can be properly served without being detained, he or she shall be provided evaluation, crisis intervention, or other inpatient or outpatient services on a voluntary basis. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to prevent a peace officer from delivering individuals to a designated facility for assessment under this section.

The application shall also record whether the historical course of the person’s mental disorder was considered in the determination, pursuant to Section 5150.05. If the probable cause is based on the statement of a person other than the peace officer, professional person in charge of the facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment, member of the attending staff, or professional person designated by the county, the person shall be liable in a civil action for intentionally giving a statement that he or she knows to be false.
(f) At the time a person is taken into custody for evaluation, or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless a responsible relative or the guardian or conservator of the person is in possession of the person’s personal property, the person taking him or her into custody shall take reasonable precautions to preserve and safeguard the personal property in the possession of or on the premises occupied by the person. The person taking him or her into custody shall then furnish to the court a report generally describing the person’s property so preserved and safeguarded and its disposition, in substantially the form set forth in Section 5211, except that if a responsible relative or the guardian or conservator of the person is in possession of the person’s property, the report shall include only the name of the relative or guardian or conservator and the location of the property, whereupon responsibility of the person taking him or her into custody for that property shall terminate. As used in this section, “responsible relative” includes the spouse, parent, adult child, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or adult brother or sister of the person.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, provides for the involuntary commitment and treatment of persons with specified mental disorders for the protection of the persons so committed. Under the act, when a person, as a result of mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, he or she may, upon probable cause, be taken into custody by a peace officer, member of the attending staff of an evaluation facility, designated members of a mobile crisis team, or other designated professional person, and placed in a facility designated by the county and approved by the State Department of Social Services as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. Existing law requires, when determining if probable cause exists to take a person into custody, or cause a person to be taken into custody pursuant to the provisions described above, any person who is authorized to take or cause that person to be taken into custody to consider available relevant information about the historical course of the person’s mental disorder, as specified, if the authorized person determines that information has a reasonable bearing on the determination described above.
This bill would provide that, when determining if a person should be taken into custody pursuant to the provisions described above, the individual making that determination shall consider available relevant information about the historical course of the person’s mental disorder if the individual concludes that the information has a reasonable bearing on the determination, and that the individual shall not be limited to consideration of the danger of imminent harm.
Existing law requires the admitting facility to require an application in writing stating the circumstances under which the person’s condition was called to the attention of those persons authorized to make the determination of probable cause, and stating that he or she has probable cause, as specified.
The bill would also require the application to record whether the historical course of a person’s mental disorder was considered in the determination of probable cause.
By imposing additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health."

750,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) One of the biggest challenges currently faced by charter schools is finding suitable facilities and funding for those facilities. Charter schools typically do not receive local funding through bonds and must pay for their facilities out of general operating expenses. As a result, many charter schools turn to private financing and bond transactions to pay for a long-term facilities solution.
(b) The California School Finance Authority currently operates several valuable programs to assist schools seeking facilities financing, including its conduit revenue bond financing program. However, because charter schools are generally rated low or below investment grade, and the State of California does not directly guarantee or provide for payment of charter school revenue bonds issued through the California School Finance Authority, charter schools that issue revenue bonds to finance public school facilities face excessive interest rates.
(c) A program that provides funds to insure or guarantee school facility bonds issued by the California School Finance Authority to assist charter schools with the acquisition, renovation, or construction of school facilities, or the refinancing of existing charter school facility debt, would lower borrowing costs for those schools and ensure more funds remain in California’s classrooms.

There is hereby created the California Credit Enhancement Program within the authority. The purpose of the program is to establish a fund to be used to insure facility bonds issued by the authority in order to achieve lower cost alternatives for public school facilities financing.
17201.
Notwithstanding Section 17182, in addition to the powers authorized by this chapter, the authority may leverage its funding for the California Credit Enhancement Program so the amount of credit insurance provided pursuant to the California Credit Enhancement Program exceeds the amount of funds on deposit in the California Credit Enhancement Account within the California School Finance Authority Fund created pursuant to Section 17203.
17202.
The authority shall adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of this article. The authority may consult with subject matter experts in the development of the regulations, which shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(a) Eligibility criteria for participating public schools, including financial, performance, organizational, and governance criteria. A public school that is fiscally sound and that has a good credit rating may participate in the California Credit Enhancement Program.
(b) Parameters and procedures for the provision of credit enhancement to eligible financing transactions, including, but not limited to, maximum credit enhancement limits, and provisions necessary to accommodate federal, state, and local regulatory compliance.
(c) The application process and fee schedule.
(d) A definition of “default” for purposes of the program, and procedures so that, in the event of a default, funds from the California Credit Enhancement Account are paid out only after all other sources of payment and credit enhancement to an eligible financing transaction are exhausted.
(e) Options, in the event of a default, to ensure that the first priority of the facility is the continued use for public school purposes. These options may include, but are not limited to, the relet or sale of the facility to another public school and a mechanism by which the state has a right of first refusal to purchase the facility instead of it being sold in a foreclosure sale.
(f) The structure and guidelines for investing in the California Credit Enhancement Program.
17203.
There is hereby created the California Credit Enhancement Account within the California School Finance Authority Fund, established pursuant to Section 17181. The authority shall deposit funds identified for the California Credit Enhancement Program in the California Credit Enhancement Account. The authority may, at its discretion, deposit fees collected in accordance with this chapter in the California Credit Enhancement Account, in addition to the funds authorized to be collected pursuant to Section 17181. The authority may designate and hold separately one or more subaccounts within the California Credit Enhancement Account. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the authority to deposit, or the Legislature to appropriate, funds for the purposes established in this article.
17204.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, bond insurance, credit enhancement, or other guarantees issued under this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state, or any political subdivision thereof, and shall not be deemed to be a pledge of the faith and credit of the state, or any political subdivision thereof, other than the authority. Bond insurance, credit enhancement, or other guarantees of the authority shall be payable solely from funds available in the California Credit Enhancement Account.
(b) Each bond insurance policy, credit enhancement instrument, or other guarantee of the authority issued under the California Credit Enhancement Program shall include a statement on its face that neither the State of California nor the authority is obligated to pay the principal or interest thereon, except from revenues of the authority available therefor, and shall also include a statement that neither the faith or credit, nor the taxing power of the State of California, or any political subdivision thereof, is pledged to the payment of the principal or interest of the bonds covered by the California Credit Enhancement Program.
(c) The issuance of bond insurance, credit enhancement, or other guarantees under this chapter shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state, or any political subdivision thereof, to levy or pledge any form of taxation, or make any appropriation for their payment.","The California School Finance Authority Act establishes the California School Finance Authority, and authorizes the authority to, among other things, issue revenue bonds to finance or refinance educational facility projects for school districts, charter schools, county offices of education, and community college districts. Existing law establishes the California School Finance Authority Fund, administered by the authority, and continuously appropriates moneys in the fund for purposes of the act.
This bill would create within the authority the California Credit Enhancement Program for the purpose of establishing a fund to insure school facility bonds issued by the authority pursuant to the act, as specified. The bill would create the California Credit Enhancement Account within the California School Finance Authority Fund, would authorize the authority to deposit fees collected pursuant to the program in that account, and would specify that bond insurance, credit enhancement, or other guarantees of the authority shall be payable solely from funds available in that account. By authorizing money in the California School Finance Authority Fund to be used for a new purpose, the bill would make an appropriation.

In order to provide the Fair Political Practices Commission with authority and sufficient time to adopt regulations necessary to implement the substantive requirements of this act before the January 1, 2017, operative date, it is necessary that this bill take effect immediately.","Existing provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974 regulate the activities of lobbyists, lobbying firms, and lobbyist employers in connection with attempts to influence legislative and administrative action by legislative and other state officials, including requirements that lobbyists, lobbying firms, and lobbyist employers register and file periodic reports with the Secretary of State. For purposes of these provisions, “lobbyist” is defined, in part, as an individual who receives $2,000 or more in economic consideration in a calendar month, or whose principal duties as an employee are, to communicate with specified officials for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action.
This bill would revise the definition of “lobbyist” to include specified conduct by an individual acting on behalf of any person other than his or her employer for the purpose of influencing administrative action that is governmental procurement, which is further defined to include various actions regarding a state procurement contract for which the total estimated cost exceeds $250,000, thereby making the above-described lobbying requirements applicable to the specified attempts to influence governmental procurement.

Public Resources Code
, to read:
10.5.
The California River Revitalization and Greenway Development Act of 2015
5845.
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as CalRIVER.
5846.
It is the intent of the Legislature that, in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase greenhouse gas sequestration, the state shall protect, restore, and enhance a network of river systems and their riparian corridors to increase water retention, improve water quality, improve urban greening and urban reforestation, reduce the heat-island effect, increase active transportation, such as biking and walking, improve nonmotorized mobility in the surrounding communities, and decrease vehicle miles traveled.
5847.
(a)The Natural Resources Agency shall establish a grant program for projects on or adjacent to riparian corridors that furthers the regulatory purposes of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) and meets the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan and Communities Revitalization Act (Chapter 4.1 (commencing with Section 39710) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code).
(b)To be eligible for funding under the program, a project shall demonstrate that it will achieve a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases. In selecting projects for funding, the Natural Resources Agency, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, shall consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases.
(c)In evaluating grant applications for funding, the Natural Resources Agency shall, in addition to prioritizing projects pursuant to subdivision (b), consider the extent to which a project provides the greatest level of the following cobenefits:
(1)Recreational access to and improved human interaction with a river or riparian corridor, especially in urban corridors and park-starved communities.
(2)Improved transportation mobility, especially pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit.
(3)Economic viability of the surrounding community by promoting appropriate development, especially in an urban setting.
(4)Development of visitor-serving and interpretive facilities.
(5)Access and development of pocket parks, community gardens, demonstration gardens, and other urban greening.
(6)Species protections and the protection of habitat strongholds, including improved wildlife corridors.
(7)Improved resiliency in the face of unavoidable impacts from climate change.
(8)Improved water supply, flood protection, and water quality, including the water quality of impaired water bodies through river restoration.
(9)Job training and workforce development, especially projects that involve disadvantaged youth and veterans.
(10)Improved stormwater retention.
(d)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter shall also be consistent with both of the following:
(1)The California Water Action Plan published by the Governor.
(2)The Safeguarding California Plan published by the Natural Resources Agency.
(e)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter for flood protection shall be consistent, as applicable, with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 8400) of Part 2 of Division 5, Part 6 (commencing with Section 9600) of Division 5, and Part 9 (commencing with Section 12980) of Division 6, of the Water Code.
(f)The Natural Resources Agency shall also prioritize funding pursuant to this chapter for projects with the following characteristics:
(1)Are consistent with a parkway, greenway, or urban greening plan.
(2)Leverage moneys from the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election.
(3)Provide recreational access and opportunities to major metropolitan areas of the state, including those that are relatively underserved by parks.
5848.
The CalRIVER fund is hereby created in the State Treasury to be administered by the Natural Resources Agency. The moneys in the CalRIVER Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be expended by the Natural Resources Agency in accordance with this chapter. The Legislature may transfer moneys to the fund from bond proceeds and special funds, including, but not limited to, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.
5849.
The secretary shall develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of this chapter.","Existing law, as part of the hazardous waste control law, requires a facility handling hazardous waste to obtain a hazardous waste facilities permit from the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Existing law requires the department to impose certain conditions on each hazardous waste facilities permit and authorizes the department to impose other conditions on a hazardous waste facilities permit, as specified. A violation of the hazardous waste control law is a crime.
This bill would require the department, within 90 days of receiving a renewal application for a hazardous waste facilities permit, to hold a public meeting for specified purposes in or near the community in which the hazardous waste facility is located.
Existing law prohibits the department from issuing or renewing a permit to operate a hazardous waste facility unless the owner or operator of the facility establishes and maintains financial assurances.
This bill would require the department to review the financial assurances required to operate a hazardous waste facility at least once every 5 years. If the department’s review finds the financial assurances for a facility to be inadequate, the bill would require the department to notify the owner or operator of the facility and would require the owner or operator to update and adopt adequate financial assurances within 90 days.
Because a violation of the bill’s requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law establishes various plans and programs to preserve, protect, and rehabilitate lands adjacent to rivers in the state.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.
This bill would require the Natural Resources Agency to establish a grant program for projects on or adjacent to riparian corridors that, among other things, furthers the regulatory purposes of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and to consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and provides the greatest level of specified cobenefits. The bill would create the CalRIVER Fund in the State Treasury, with moneys in the fund to be available upon appropriation to implement the grant program.
The bill would require the secretary of the agency to develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of the grant program.","An act to add Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 5845) to Division 5 of the Public Resources Code, relating to rivers.
An act to amend Section 25205 of, and to add Section 25200.1.3 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to hazardous waste facilities."

SECTION 1.
Chapter 2.7 (commencing with Section 15180) is added to Part 6 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
CHAPTER  2.7. Offender Global Positioning System Database
15180.
It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for a statewide database to receive and house all Global Positioning System (GPS) device data for offenders monitored by criminal justice agencies throughout the state. Developing and implementing this database is a matter of public safety and statewide importance. Presently there is no ability for criminal justice agencies to access each other’s GPS device data to determine if an offender placed on GPS by one entity is in the proximity of another offender monitored by a different entity. A GPS database that can be accessed by criminal justice agencies will enhance supervision practices, promote rehabilitative services, assist investigations and ensure offender accountability and community safety.
15181.
The Department of Justice shall implement, operate, and maintain the Offender Global Positioning System Database for the use of criminal justice agencies.
15182.
As used in this chapter, the following terms are defined below:
(a) “Alert” means a notification from the database to the monitoring agency or user.
(b) “Database” means the Offender Global Positioning System Database as described in this chapter.
(c) “Global Positioning System device” or “GPS device” means a device that uses signals from satellites to determine an offender’s physical location with a high degree of accuracy.
(d) “Monitoring agency” means the criminal justice agency responsible, pursuant to statute or court order, for monitoring an offender.
(e) “Offender” means any person convicted of a crime and who is subject to GPS device monitoring by a criminal justice agency.
(f) “Reporting cycle” means the specified minimum interval at which a GPS device is to transmit data to the database.
(g) “User” means a criminal justice agency with a data connection to the database.
15183.
(a) On or before January 1, ______, the Department of Justice shall develop functional specifications and standards for offender GPS devices in compliance with the following objectives:
(1) The GPS device shall transmit GPS data information to the database at a specified reporting cycle. The GPS data information transmitted to the database shall include the following data elements:
(A) Latitude.
(B) Longitude.
(C) The offender’s full name.
(D) The offender’s date of birth.
(E) The monitoring entity’s contact information.
(F) The GPS device identification number.
(2) The GPS device shall be capable of receiving commands from the database to transmit the data information identified in paragraph (1) regardless of the device’s reporting cycle.
(b) On or before January 1, ____, the Department of Justice shall develop functional specifications and standards for the database in compliance with the following objectives:
(1) The database shall receive information from GPS devices to include the data elements in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).
(2) The database shall permit users to track and view offender’s proximity to other offenders.
(3) The database shall permit users to create and use offender monitoring alert zones. These zones which are electronically demarcated during GPS monitoring, are as follows:
(A) An “inclusion zone” is a geographic area within which it is appropriate for an offender to be present. If the offender leaves this zone, an alert shall occur.
(B) An “exclusion zone” is a geographic area within which an offender is not permitted. If the offender enters this zone, an alert shall occur.
(C) An “investigation zone” is a specialized geographic area created by the monitoring agency or user where, if specified criteria are met, an alert shall occur.
(4) The database shall permit users to send a command to a GPS device or multiple GPS devices to transmit the data information identified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), regardless of the device’s reporting cycle.
(5) The database shall permit users to determine if one or more offenders are, or were, at or near a particular location during a specified time frame.
(c) The Department of Justice shall consult with the following entities and groups when developing the functional specifications and standards set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b):
(1) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
(2) Chief Probation Officers of California.
(3) The California Probation, Parole, and Correctional Association.
(4) The California Police Chiefs Association.
(5) The California Peace Officers’ Association.
(6) GPS device industry representatives.
(d) Each entity and group listed in subdivision (c) may designate a representative to work with the Department of Justice to develop the functional specifications and standards set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b).
(e) Criminal justice agencies that use GPS devices for monitoring offenders shall have the ability to select from different manufacturers and vendors, in accordance with any contracting policies, rules, and regulations governing their authority to contract for those services. The functional specifications and standards shall encourage multiple bidders and shall not have the effect of limiting the criminal justice agencies to choosing a GPS device that is able to be supplied by only one manufacturer or vendor.
(f) Except as provided in subdivision (g), a GPS device purchased or used for GPS monitoring of offenders in this state shall comply with the functional specifications and standards developed pursuant to subdivision (a).
(g) Subdivision (f) does not apply to any GPS devices purchased and used to monitor offenders pursuant to a contract entered into before January 1, ____.
(h) On a triennial basis, following implementation of the functional specifications and standards for GPS devices and the database, the Department of Justice shall consult with the entities and groups identified in subdivision (c) to determine if there are any improvements to the functional specifications and standards for GPS devices and the database needed to meet the needs of law enforcement and to take advantage of advancements in GPS monitoring. The database shall be designed to accommodate present and future data-processing equipment.
15184.
The Department of Justice shall provide, at state expense, connections to the database to one sheriff’s system and one probation department system in each county, hereinafter the “county systems.” Before providing the county systems with connections to the database, the Department of Justice shall adopt and publish for distribution, the operating policies, practices, and procedures for the database, and the security requirements for county systems connecting to the database.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires sex offenders to wear global positioning system (GPS) devices while on parole, and requires some of those offenders to wear those devices for life.
This bill would require the Department of Justice to establish an Offender Global Positioning System Database that would receive and store GPS device data for offenders monitored by criminal justice agencies throughout the state. The database would be required, among other capabilities, to receive specified data and to be able to send commands to a GPS device requiring the device to report data and to comply with other functional requirements. The department would be required to provide, at state expense, connections to the database to one sheriff’s system and one probation department system in each county for purposes of submitting data to the database.
By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement agencies in connection with the operation of the GPS database, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Chapter 2.7 (commencing with Section 15180) to Part 6 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to law enforcement."

1203.
(a) As used in this code, “probation” means the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of conditional and revocable release in the community under the supervision of a probation officer. As used in this code, “conditional sentence” means the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of revocable release in the community subject to conditions established by the court without the supervision of a probation officer. It is the intent of the Legislature that both conditional sentence and probation are authorized whenever probation is authorized in any code as a sentencing option for infractions or misdemeanors.
(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (j), if a person is convicted of a felony and is eligible for probation, before judgment is pronounced, the court shall immediately refer the matter to a probation officer to investigate and report to the court, at a specified time, upon the circumstances surrounding the crime and the prior history and record of the person, which may be considered either in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment.
(2) (A) The probation officer shall immediately investigate and make a written report to the court of his or her findings and recommendations, including his or her recommendations as to the granting or denying of probation and the conditions of probation, if granted.
(B) Pursuant to Section 828 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the probation officer shall include in his or her report any information gathered by a law enforcement agency relating to the taking of the defendant into custody as a minor, which shall be considered for purposes of determining whether adjudications of commissions of crimes as a juvenile warrant a finding that there are circumstances in aggravation pursuant to Section 1170 or to deny probation.
(C) If the person was convicted of an offense that requires him or her to register as a sex offender pursuant to Sections 290 to 290.023, inclusive, or if the probation report recommends that registration be ordered at sentencing pursuant to Section 290.006, the probation officer’s report shall include the results of the State-Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders (SARATSO) administered pursuant to Sections 290.04 to 290.06, inclusive, if applicable.
(D) The probation officer may also include in the report his or her recommendation of both of the following:
(i) The amount the defendant should be required to pay as a restitution fine pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4.
(ii) Whether the court shall require, as a condition of probation, restitution to the victim or to the Restitution Fund and the amount thereof.
(E) The report shall be made available to the court and the prosecuting and defense attorneys at least five days, or upon request of the defendant or prosecuting attorney nine days, prior to the time fixed by the court for the hearing and determination of the report, and shall be filed with the clerk of the court as a record in the case at the time of the hearing. The time within which the report shall be made available and filed may be waived by written stipulation of the prosecuting and defense attorneys that is filed with the court or an oral stipulation in open court that is made and entered upon the minutes of the court.
A request for a continuance of the hearing based on a failure to make the report available to the parties within the deadlines specified above may be granted by the court only upon a finding of good cause.
(3) At a time fixed by the court, the court shall hear and determine the application, if one has been made, or, in any case, the suitability of probation in the particular case. At the hearing, the court shall consider any report of the probation officer, including the results of the SARATSO, if applicable, and shall make a statement that it has considered the report, which shall be filed with the clerk of the court as a record in the case. If the court determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed by law or that the ends of justice would be served by granting probation to the person, it may place the person on probation. If probation is denied, the clerk of the court shall immediately send a copy of the report to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at the prison or other institution to which the person is delivered.
(4) The preparation of the report or the consideration of the report by the court may be waived only by a written stipulation of the prosecuting and defense attorneys that is filed with the court or an oral stipulation in open court that is made and entered upon the minutes of the court, except that a waiver shall not be allowed unless the court consents thereto. However, if the defendant is ultimately sentenced and committed to the state prison, a probation report shall be completed pursuant to Section 1203c.
(c) If a defendant is not represented by an attorney, the court shall order the probation officer who makes the probation report to discuss its contents with the defendant.

The judge, in his or her discretion, may direct the probation officer to investigate all facts relevant to the sentencing of the person.

The amount and method of reimbursement shall be in accordance with Section 1203.1b.
(j) In any court where a county financial evaluation officer is available, in addition to referring the matter to the probation officer, the court may order the defendant to appear before the county financial evaluation officer for a financial evaluation of the defendant’s ability to pay restitution, in which case the county financial evaluation officer shall report his or her findings regarding restitution and other court-related costs to the probation officer on the question of the defendant’s ability to pay those costs.
Any order made pursuant to this subdivision may be enforced as a violation of the terms and conditions of probation upon willful failure to pay and at the discretion of the court, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action, if any balance remains unpaid at the end of the defendant’s probationary period.
(k) Probation shall not be granted to, nor shall the execution of, or imposition of sentence be suspended for, any person who is convicted of a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, or a serious felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7, and who was on probation for a felony offense at the time of the commission of the new felony offense.","Existing law provides that, if a person is convicted of a felony and is eligible for probation, the court is required to refer the matter to a probation officer to create a probation sentencing report containing specified information that may be considered either in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment before judgment is pronounced. Existing law requires the probation sentencing report to be provided to the court and to the parties at least 5 days, or upon request of the defendant or prosecuting attorney, 9 days, before the sentencing hearing unless the deadline is waived by the parties, as specified. Existing law provides that generally, a person seeking to continue a hearing in a criminal proceeding is required to file and serve a written notice to all parties at least 2 court days before the hearing that is to be continued.
This bill would authorize a court to grant the defendant’s request for continuance when the probation department fails to provide the report by the 5-day or 9-day deadline only if the court finds good cause to grant the continuance.","An act to amend Section 1203 of the Penal Code, relating to probation."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for the owner or operator of a tow truck to stop at the scene of an accident or near a disabled vehicle for the purpose of soliciting an engagement for towing services, either directly or indirectly, or to furnish any towing services, unless summoned to the scene, requested to stop, or flagged down by the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle, or requested to perform the service by a law enforcement officer or public agency pursuant to that agency’s procedures.
This bill would, subject to exceptions, apply those provisions to a towing company. The bill would also require, in addition to being summoned to the scene or requested to stop by the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle, that the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck possess specified information in writing prior to arriving at the scene, or obtain specified information prior to leaving the scene, and would require that information to be made available to law enforcement, upon request, from the time the tow truck appears at the scene until the time the vehicle is towed and released to a third party. The bill would provide that a writing for this purpose includes an electronic record.
(2) Existing law also makes it a misdemeanor for the owner or operator of a tow truck to move any vehicle from a highway, street, or public property without the express authorization of the owner or operator of the vehicle or a law enforcement officer or public agency pursuant to that agency’s procedures, when the vehicle has been left unattended or when there is an injury as the result of an accident.
This bill would recast, and subject to exceptions, apply those provisions to a towing company. The bill would delete the requirement for the express authorization of the owner or operator of the vehicle. The bill would require the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck to obtain specified information and to make that information available to law enforcement, upon request, from the time the vehicle is attached to or loaded on to the tow truck until the time the vehicle is towed and released to a third party.
The bill would, subject to exceptions, and if the vehicle owner or operator is present, also require the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck to furnish the vehicle’s owner or operator with a written itemized estimate of all charges and services to be performed. Prior to removing the vehicle, the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow truck would be required to obtain the vehicle owner or operator’s signature on the itemized estimate, and to furnish a copy to the person who signed the estimate, as specified.
The bill would require a towing company or the owner or operator of a tow truck to maintain specified documents for 3 years and to make those documents available for inspection and copying within 48 hours of a written request by specified law enforcement and prosecutorial entities. The bill would also require a business taking possession of a vehicle from a tow truck to document specified information, to maintain those documents for 3 years, and to make those documents available for inspection and copying within 48 hours of a written request by any officer or agent of a police department, sheriff’s department, the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the Attorney General’s office, the Bureau of Automotive Repair, a district attorney’s office, or a city attorney’s office.
The bill would provide, except for those provisions described in paragraph (1) above, that a willful violation of these requirements is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500, or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding 3 months, or both imprisonment and that fine.
By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 22513 of, and to add Section 22513.1 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

SECTION 1.
Section 65850.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:
65850.7.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The implementation of consistent statewide standards to achieve the timely and cost-effective installation of electric vehicle charging stations is not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution, but is instead a matter of statewide concern.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies not adopt ordinances that create unreasonable barriers to the installation of electric vehicle charging stations and not unreasonably restrict the ability of homeowners and agricultural and business concerns to install electric vehicle charging stations.
(3) It is the policy of the state to promote and encourage the use of electric vehicle charging stations and to limit obstacles to their use.
(4) It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies comply not only with the language of this section, but also the legislative intent to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to, and minimizing costs of, permitting for charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official’s authority to identify and address higher priority life-safety situations.
(b) A city, county, or city and county shall administratively approve an application to install electric vehicle charging stations through the issuance of a building permit or similar nondiscretionary permit. Review of the application to install an electric vehicle charging station shall be limited to the building official’s review of whether it meets all health and safety requirements of local, state, and federal law. The requirements of local law shall be limited to those standards and regulations necessary to ensure that the electric vehicle charging station will not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. However, if the building official of the city, county, or city and county makes a finding, based on substantial evidence, that the electric vehicle charging station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the city, county, or city and county may require the applicant to apply for a use permit.
(c) A city, county, or city and county may not deny an application for a use permit to install an electric vehicle charging station unless it makes written findings based upon substantial evidence in the record that the proposed installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact. The findings shall include the basis for the rejection of potential feasible alternatives of preventing the adverse impact.
(d) The decision of the building official pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) may be appealed to the planning commission of the city, county, or city and county.

In developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which electric vehicle charging stations shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the city, county, or city and county, shall be deemed complete. Upon confirmation by the city, county, or city and county of the application and supporting documents being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, and consistent with the ordinance, a city, county, or city and county shall, consistent with subdivision (b), approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. However, the city, county, or city and county may establish a process to prioritize competing applications for expedited permits. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, a city, county, or city and county shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. An application submitted to a city, county, or city and county that owns and operates an electric utility shall demonstrate compliance with the utility’s interconnection policies prior to approval.

In developing the ordinance, the city, county, or city and county may refer to the recommendations contained in the most current version of the “Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist” of the “Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook” published by the Office of Planning and Research. A city, county, or city and county may adopt an ordinance that modifies the checklists and standards found in the guidebook due to unique climactic, geological, seismological, or topographical conditions. If a city, county, or city and county determines that it is unable to authorize the acceptance of an electronic signature on all forms, applications, and other documents in lieu of a wet signature by an applicant, the city, county, or city and county shall state, in the ordinance required under this subdivision, the reasons for its inability to accept electronic signatures and acceptance of an electronic signature shall not be required.
(h) A city, county, or city and county shall not condition approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of an electric vehicle charging station by an association, as that term is defined in Section 4080 of the Civil Code.
(i) The following definitions shall apply to this section:
(1) “A feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact” includes, but is not limited to, any cost-effective method, condition, or mitigation imposed by a city, county, or city and county on another similarly situated application in a prior successful application for a permit.
(2) “Electronic submittal” means the utilization of one or more of the following:
(A) Email.
(B) The Internet.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Research shows that children who eat breakfast have improved cognitive function, demonstrate higher academic achievement, exhibit better behavior, and have healthier diets, as compared to children who do not eat breakfast.
(b) Research also shows that breakfasts served at school are generally more nutritious than breakfasts served at home.
(c) Each
school day,
schoolday,
2.2 million of the state’s low-income pupils miss out on the health and academic benefits of school breakfasts and, in total, 4.3 million of California’s public school pupils miss out on school
breakfast
breakfasts
each schoolday.
(d) Serving breakfast after the start of the schoolday has been shown to significantly improve school breakfast participation, yield fiscal benefits, and improve the learning environment for all pupils by decreasing absenteeism, tardiness, reports of hunger-related illness, and disciplinary issues.
(e) The federal School Breakfast Program enables school districts to draw on federal funds designated to serve low-income pupils. If the federal School Breakfast Program reached as many low-income pupils as the federal National School Lunch Program, California’s public schools would receive an additional $344 million in federal meal reimbursements, providing essential resources to the state’s most vulnerable children.
(f) Fiscal research shows that increasing participation in the federal School Breakfast Program immediately and positively impacts the California economy by distributing federal funds to school districts, increasing local employment, and increasing purchases of food and equipment.
(g) Given the academic, health, and fiscal benefits of school breakfasts, high-need schools serving low-income pupils should make breakfast readily available and accessible during the schoolday.

(B) On and after July 1, 2018, the requirements of subparagraph (A) shall apply only to schools where at least 60 percent, but less than 80 percent, of the pupils enrolled in that school are needy children as defined in Section 49552.
(3) On and after July 1, 2018, if at least 80 percent of the pupils enrolled in a school are needy children as defined in Section 49552, the school shall comply with both of the following requirements:
(A) A nutritionally adequate breakfast shall be made available to pupils each schoolday. This breakfast shall be offered at no cost to the pupils. No pupil shall be required to consume a meal.
(B) The breakfast provided pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be available to pupils after instruction has begun for the schoolday.
(d) As used in this section, “after instruction has begun for the schoolday” means after the time the schoolday has begun for a majority of the pupils enrolled at that school.
(e) This section shall not be construed to require a school to set aside instructional time for the purpose of serving breakfast.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires each school district or county superintendent of schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to provide one nutritionally adequate free or reduced-price meal for each needy pupil during each schoolday, except as specified. Existing law authorizes a school district or county office of education to use funds made available through any applicable federal or state program or to use its own funds to provide the required meals.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to the federal School Breakfast Program.
The bill, from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, would require each school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to make a nutritionally adequate breakfast available for all of the pupils in a school, when at least 40% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, as defined. On and after July 1, 2017, these requirements would apply only to schools where at least 40%, but less than 60%, of the pupils enrolled in that school are needy children.
The bill, from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, inclusive, with respect to schools where at least 60% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, would additionally require these nutritionally adequate breakfasts to be available to pupils after instruction has begun for the schoolday, as defined. On and after July 1, 2018, these requirements would apply only to schools where at least 60%, but less than 80%, of the pupils enrolled in that school are needy children.
The bill, on and after July 1, 2018, with respect to schools where at least 80% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, would additionally require these nutritionally adequate breakfasts to be available to pupils, at no cost to the pupil, after instruction has begun for the schoolday, as defined.
The bill would also specify that these provisions shall not be construed to require a school to set aside instructional time for the purpose of serving breakfast.
To the extent that this bill would create new duties for school districts and county offices of education, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 49550 of the Education Code, relating to pupil nutrition."

6254.32.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, including, but not limited to, Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, a recording made by a body worn camera is confidential and shall not be disclosed, except that the recording shall be disclosed to the person whose image is recorded by the body worn camera.
(b) The following definitions shall apply to this section:
(1) “Body worn camera” means a device attached to the uniform or body of a peace officer that records video, audio, or both, in a digital or analog format.
(2) “Peace officer” means any person designated as a peace officer pursuant to Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 6254.32 to the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
The need to protect individual privacy from the public disclosure of images captured by a body worn camera outweighs the interest in the public disclosure of that information.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 6254.32 to the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
Protecting the privacy of a person whose image is captured by body worn cameras on local peace officers enhances public safety and the protection of individual rights, thereby furthering the purposes of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.

This section shall not apply to investigations or proceedings concerning the conduct of peace officers or custodial officers, or an agency or department that employs those officers, conducted by a grand jury, a district attorney’s office, or the Attorney General’s office.
(b)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency shall release to the complaining party a copy of his or her own statements at the time the complaint is filed.
(c)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency that employs peace or custodial officers may disseminate data regarding the number, type, or disposition of complaints (sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or unfounded) made against its officers if that information is in a form that does not identify the individuals involved.
(d)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a department or agency that employs peace or custodial officers may release factual information concerning a disciplinary investigation if the officer who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation, or the officer’s agent or representative, publicly makes a statement he or she knows to be false concerning the investigation or the imposition of disciplinary action. Information may not be disclosed by the peace or custodial officer’s employer unless the false statement was published by an established medium of communication, including, but not limited to, television, radio, or a newspaper. Disclosure of factual information by the employing agency pursuant to this subdivision is limited to facts contained in the officer’s personnel file concerning the disciplinary investigation or imposition of disciplinary action that specifically refute the false statements made public by the peace or custodial officer or his or her agent or representative.
(e)(1)The department or agency shall provide written notification to the complaining party of the disposition of the complaint within 30 days of the disposition.
(2)The notification described in this subdivision shall not be conclusive or binding or admissible as evidence in any separate or subsequent action or proceeding brought before an arbitrator, court, or judge of this state or the United States.
(f)Nothing in this section shall affect the discovery or disclosure of information contained in a peace or custodial officer’s personnel file pursuant to Section 1043 of the Evidence Code.","(1) The California Public Records Act requires that public records be open to inspection at all times during the office hours of a state or local agency and that every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as specifically provided. The act further requires that a reasonably segregable portion of a public record be available for inspection by any person requesting the public record after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law.
This bill would, notwithstanding any other law, prohibit the disclosure of a recording made by a body worn camera, as defined, except for requiring disclosure to the person whose image is recorded by the body worn camera.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(3) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

Thereafter, a transit operator operating an articulated transit bus shall annually provide notice by July 1, to all cities and counties in whose jurisdiction the bus will operate in the upcoming calendar year, identifying any changes to the service on those routes and any new routes upon which the bus is expected to be scheduled for the upcoming year. The notice shall include data from information provided by the bus manufacturer to the transit operator, identifying the weight of the articulated bus.
(g) For purposes of this section, the term “curb weight” means the total weight of a fully loaded transit bus, including maximum fuel, oil, and coolant, and all equipment used in the normal operation of the bus, except without passengers or a driver.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, operative January 1, 2016, provides that the gross weight on any one axle of a bus shall not exceed 20,500 pounds. Existing law exempts from this limitation a transit bus procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued before January 1, 2013. A violation of this provision is a crime.
This bill would exempt from the weight limitation transit buses procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued before January 1, 2016. The bill would provide that the weight limitation would not apply to a bus purchased during an option period in a multiyear contract to purchase transit buses that is entered into before January 1, 2016, by a publicly owned or operated transit system, or an operator of a transit system under contract with a publicly owned or operated transit system, provided that the option period does not exceed 5 years from the date of the original contract, or extend beyond January 1, 2021, whichever is earlier. This bill would also establish certain weight limitations for transit buses procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued at a specified time. The bill would provide that these provisions do not authorize the operation of a transit bus on a bridge or certain other structures if the gross weight of the transit bus is greater than the maximum weight which the bridge or other structure can safely sustain. The bill would require, if the gross weight imposed upon the highway by the wheels on any one axle of a transit bus exceeds 20,000 pounds, the axle to be supported by 4 wheels bearing load upon the highway. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require a transit operator operating an articulated bus to provide notice, by July 1, 2016, to all cities and counties in whose jurisdiction the bus will operate in the upcoming calendar year, of the approximate routes upon which the bus will operate. The bill would also require an annual notice by July 1 thereafter to all cities and counties under whose jurisdiction the bus will operate, identifying any changes to the service on those routes or any new routes upon which the bus is expected to be scheduled for the upcoming calendar year.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 35554 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."
769,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California supports the dignity, independence, and choice of seniors and persons with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate, in their own home or a community-based setting, and to be free from unnecessary institutionalization.
(b) The American population is swiftly aging. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2007 individuals 65 years of age and over represented 12.6 percent of the American population; by 2030 it is estimated the older adult population will reach 20 percent of the whole, with 70 million adults over 65 years of age. Many of these adults will experience disability and chronic conditions. The Alzheimer’s Association reports that over five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease and that number will grow to 16 million by 2050, with the cost of caring for those individuals growing from $203 billion in 2013 to $1.2 trillion by mid-century.
(c) According to the United States Census, California’s older adult population is the country’s largest, with over four million seniors currently residing in the state. The California Department of Aging reports that one in every five Californians is now 60 years of age or older and 40 percent of those individuals have a disability. The state’s population is also diverse: just under one-half million older adults in the state identify as Latino or Hispanic, 354,000 identify as Asian, over 182,000 as African American, and over 100,000 people as Native American, Pacific Islander, or multiracial.
(d) Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) was established in California in 1974 as a service designed to meet the needs of older adults and adults with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutional care. ADHC centers are licensed daytime health facilities that provide integrated services from a multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and other professionals.
(e) ADHC centers serve frail elders and other adults with disabilities, chronic conditions, and complex care needs, such as Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia, diabetes, high blood pressure, mental health diagnoses, traumatic brain injury, and people who have had a stroke or breathing problems or who cannot take medications properly.
(f) ADHC centers also offer caregiver support, addressing research findings that identify caregiver stress as a leading cause of placement in a nursing facility, as well as putting the aging or disabled adult at increased risk for abuse or neglect.
(g) ADHC services include health, therapeutic, and social services including transportation; skilled nursing care; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; medical social work services; therapeutic exercise activities; protective supervision; activities of daily living; brain-stimulating activities; and a nutritionally balanced hot meal. Services are provided in accordance with a person-centered care plan designed after a three-day interdisciplinary team assessment that includes a home visit and communication with the participant’s primary care physician.
(h) ADHC participants, who are at risk of institutionalization, receive services in the center and return to their own homes at night. According to a 2012 study by the California Medicaid Research Institute, the statewide weighted average annual per person nursing home cost for Medi-Cal/Medicare recipients in California is $83,364, while the average annual expenditure per person for ADHC for this population is $9,312.
(i) ADHC centers are licensed by the State Department of Public Health and overseen by the California Department of Aging and the State Department of Health Care Services.
(j) In 1977, Senator Henry Mello issued a report that identified the need for 600 ADHC centers statewide to meet the needs of California’s elder population. At its peak in 2004, approximately 360 ADHC centers provided care to over 40,000 medically fragile Californians. In December 2013, there were a total of 270 open ADHC centers in California, including 245 serving the Medi-Cal population, two centers serving private-pay clients, and 23 centers associated with Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. Medi-Cal recipients receiving services at ADHC centers totaled 28,777 persons.
(k) In 2015, 32 California counties do not have an adult day health center, including Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Inyo, Kings, Lake, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Yuba.
(l) For many years, ADHC was a state plan optional benefit of the Medi-Cal program, offering an integrated medical and social services model of care that helped individuals continue to live outside of nursing homes or other institutions.
(m) California’s adult day services have experienced significant instability in recent years due to California’s fiscal crisis and subsequent budget reductions. The Budget Act of 2011 and the related trailer bill, Chapter 3 of the Statutes of 2011, eliminated ADHC as a Medi-Cal optional state plan benefit.
(n) A class action lawsuit, Esther Darling, et al. v. Toby Douglas, et al., challenged the elimination of ADHC as a violation of the Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. The state settled the lawsuit, agreeing to replace ADHC services with a new program called Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS), effective April 1, 2012, to provide necessary medical and social services to individuals with intensive health care needs. CBAS is a managed care benefit, administered through California’s Medi-Cal Managed Care Organizations. For CBAS-eligible individuals who do not qualify for managed care enrollment and who have an approved medical exemption or who reside in a county where managed care is currently not available, CBAS services are provided as a Medi-Cal fee-for-service benefit.
(o) The State Department of Health Care Services amended the “California Bridge to Reform” Section 1115 Waiver to include the new CBAS program, which was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on March 30, 2012, and renewed on November 28, 2014. CBAS is operational under the Section 1115 Bridge to Reform Waiver through October 31, 2015.
(p) Adult day services and CBAS programs remain a source of necessary skilled nursing, therapeutic services, personal care, supervision, health monitoring, and caregiver support. The state’s demographic forecast projects the continued growth of the aging population at least through the year 2050, thereby increasing the need and demand for integrated, community-based services.
(q) Continuation of a well-defined and well-regulated system of CBAS programs is essential in order to meet the rapidly changing needs of California’s diverse and aging population and the state’s goals for the Coordinated Care Initiative.
(r) Ensuring that the key elements of the CBAS program are codified in state law stabilizes the program’s structure and eligibility framework in order to enable thousands of disabled and frail Californians who rely upon adult day health programs today, and those who will need this service in the future, to be able to continue to receive services that support them in remaining independent and free of institutionalization for as long as possible.

SEC. 2.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
The immediate continuation of assistance with broadband deployment is a primary purpose of the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account. In order to ensure funding for regular broadband consortia activities, adequate funding must be made available. The Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account has been exhausted and unless moneys are made available immediately, deployment activities could cease.","Existing law, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, establishes a program of cooperative federalism for the regulation of telecommunications to attain the goal of local competition, while implementing specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, consistent with certain universal service principles. The universal service principles include the principle that consumers in all regions of the nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas. The act authorizes each state to adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within the state, only to the extent that they adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms that do not rely on or burden federal universal service support mechanisms.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations, as defined. Existing law establishes the California Advanced Services Fund, referred to as the CASF, in the State Treasury. Existing law requires the commission to develop, implement, and administer the CASF to encourage deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all Californians that will promote economic growth, job creation, and substantial social benefits of advanced information and communications technologies, as provided in specified decisions of the commission and in the CASF statute. Existing law establishes 4 accounts, the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account, the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account, the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account, and the Broadband Public Housing Account within the CASF. Existing law requires that of the moneys collected for CASF on and after January 1, 2011, $10,000,000 is to be deposited into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account and used for specified purposes, and $15,000,000 is to be deposited into the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account and used for specified purposes.
This bill would require that of the moneys collected for CASF on and after January 1, 2011, $15,000,000 is to be deposited into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account and used for specified purposes, and $10,000,000 is to be deposited into the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account and used for specified purposes.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 281 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to telecommunications, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
771,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In 2011, there were 29,757 fatal motor vehicle crashes and 1,530,000 nonfatal serious injury crashes in the United States.
(b) Existing law requires, within 24 hours of the arrival of a patient in the emergency department of a general acute care hospital, including a motor vehicle crash victim, who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication, the hospital to make reasonable efforts to contact the patient’s agent, surrogate, or a family member or other person the hospital reasonably believes has the authority to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient.
(c) Contrary to popular belief, emergency medical technicians and law enforcement do not have immediate access to family contact information following a motor vehicle crash involving individuals who are unconscious or unable to communicate, and, typically, on-scene law enforcement resort to searching personal belongings, such as a wallet, driver’s license, glove compartment, or cell phone for leads to the identity of a family member or next of kin.
(d) Critical hours elapse as family members are not notified and unconscious motor vehicle crash victims enter the emergency department of a general acute care hospital without the benefit of family members to advocate on their behalf or provide important information to enhance medical care, as there is a national average of six hours’ lack of notice for in-state incidents and over two days’ lack of notice for out-of-state incidents.
(e) In 2008, a VinECON policy resolution was adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials’ (AASHTO) Standing Committee on Highway Traffic Safety Subcommittee on Safety Management, with the support and assistance of the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Association of State EMS Officials, the International Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, and the Governors Highway Safety Association.
(f) The AASHTO VinECON policy resolution encouraged motor vehicle manufacturers to establish a national law enforcement vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database, in conjunction with the National Law Enforcement Telecommunication System (Nlets).
(g) As authorized by the City of Los Angeles in 2013, pursuant to Council File No. 13-0002-S3, the City of Los Angeles adopted a resolution seeking a sponsor of California legislation to the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles enforcing the AASHTO VinECON policy resolution.
(h) A purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle from a new motor vehicle dealer in this state should have the right to voluntarily register at the point of sale an emergency contact to be stored in the VinECON database to be utilized by law enforcement if the motor vehicle is involved in a crash or other emergency situation rendering the occupant unconscious or otherwise unable to communicate with the contact person or persons.
(i) As authorized by the Legislature in 2001, the Department of Motor Vehicles administers the Business Partner Automation Program, pursuant to Section 1685 of the Vehicle Code, to improve the quality of registration products and services by licensing qualified private industry partners to provide secure electronic portals to licensed new motor vehicle dealers so that they may perform required registration tasks and services electronically.
(j) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to further increase the registration benefits of the DMV Business Partner Automation Program by allowing a purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle to voluntarily register at point of sale an emergency contact in the VinECON database using electronic programs provided by a qualified private industry partner. This act will assist police to expeditiously provide VinECON data to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital receiving a motor vehicle crash victim who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication.
SEC. 2.
Section 9956 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:
9956.
(a) This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the “Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015.”
(b) For purposes of this section, “VinECON database” means the national law enforcement vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database.
(c) This database shall be established by motor vehicle manufacturers, in conjunction with law enforcement agencies and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
(d) This section applies only to vehicles sold or leased in this state on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later.
(e) (1) A new motor vehicle dealer of a motor vehicle sold or leased in this state on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later, shall allow a purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle to voluntarily register at point of sale an emergency contact in the VinECON database using electronic programs provided by a DMV licensed electronic registration private industry partner.
(2) A new motor vehicle dealer providing services under paragraph (1) may charge the purchaser a VinECON electronic registration fee equal to the dealer’s electronic registration costs, not to exceed thirty-one dollars ($31).
(3)  A new motor vehicle dealer providing services under paragraph (1) may charge the purchaser a VinECON document processing fee not to exceed eighty-five dollars ($85).
(4) The VinECON data stored in the national law enforcement vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database pursuant to this section shall be made available electronically only to authorized law enforcement personnel.
(5) If a motor vehicle crash victim is rendered unable to communicate due to physical injury, law enforcement personnel shall, when practicable, expeditiously provide verbal or written VinECON data to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital receiving a motor vehicle crash victim who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication.
(6) Neither the law enforcement officer nor the law enforcement agency that employs that law enforcement officer is liable if the general acute care hospital is not able to make contact with the designated emergency contact person.
(f) (1) A new motor vehicle dealer shall make a good faith effort to register accurate VinECON data as provided by the purchaser or lessee at the original retail point of sale using electronic programs provided by a qualified private industry partner.
(2) Neither the motor vehicle manufacturer nor the new motor vehicle dealer is liable for any liability for damages, costs, or expenses, including, but not limited to, consequential damages arising or resulting from any inaccurate VinECON data or system unavailability.
(g) A violation of the requirements of this section is a cause for discipline pursuant to Section 11705.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law imposes specified requirements on manufacturers of motor vehicles sold or leased in this state. Existing law requires hospitals to make reasonable efforts to contact the agent, surrogate, or family of patients who are otherwise incapable of communication.
This bill would enact the “Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015” and would require a vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database to be established by motor vehicle manufacturers in conjunction with law enforcement agencies and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
This bill would require a motor vehicle manufacturer of a new motor vehicle sold or leased in this state on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later, to provide a means by which a purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle can voluntarily designate at the original retail point of sale an emergency contact to be stored in the VinECON database.
The bill would require the emergency contact information to be made available electronically only to authorized law enforcement and would require law enforcement personnel, when practicable, to expeditiously provide any VinECON data, either verbal or written, to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital receiving a motor vehicle crash victim who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by imposing new duties upon local agencies.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 9956 to the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

(a) The project is consistent with any applicable general plan, specific plan, and local coastal program, including any mitigation measures required by a plan or program, as that plan or program existed on the date that the application was deemed complete and with any applicable zoning ordinance, as that zoning ordinance existed on the date that the application was deemed complete, except that a project shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with the zoning designation for the site if that zoning designation is inconsistent with the general plan only because the project site has not been rezoned to conform with a more recently adopted general plan.
(b)
Community-level
A community-level
environmental review has been adopted or certified.
(c) The project and other projects approved prior to the approval of the project can be adequately served by existing utilities, and the project applicant has paid, or has committed to pay, all applicable in-lieu or development fees.
(d) The site of the project does not contain wetlands, does not have any value as a wildlife habitat, and the project does not harm any species protected by the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.) or
protected
by the Native Plant Protection Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 1900) of Division 2 of the Fish and Game Code), the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 2050) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code), and the project does not cause the destruction or removal of any species protected by a local ordinance in effect at the time the application for the project was deemed complete. For the purposes of this subdivision, “wetlands” has the same meaning as in Section 328.3 of Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations and “wildlife habitat” means the ecological communities upon which wild animals, birds, plants, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates depend for their conservation and protection.
(e) The site of the project is not included on any list of facilities and sites compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.
(f) The site of the project is subject to a preliminary endangerment assessment prepared by an environmental assessor to determine the existence of any release of a hazardous substance on the site and to determine the potential for exposure of future occupants to significant health hazards from any nearby property or activity.
(1) If a release of a hazardous substance is found to exist on the site, the release shall be removed, or any significant effects of the release shall be mitigated to a level of insignificance in compliance with state and federal requirements.
(2) If a potential for exposure to significant hazards from surrounding properties or activities is found to exist, the effects of the potential exposure shall be mitigated to a level of insignificance in compliance with state and federal requirements.
(g) The project does not have a significant effect on historical resources pursuant to Section 21084.1.
(h) The project site is not subject to any of the following:
(1) A wildland fire hazard, as determined by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, unless the applicable general plan or zoning ordinance contains provisions to mitigate the risk of a wildland fire hazard.
(2) An unusually high risk of fire or explosion from materials stored or used on nearby properties.
(3) Risk of a public health exposure at a level that would exceed the standards established by any state or federal agency.
(4) Within a delineated earthquake fault zone, as determined pursuant to Section 2622, or a seismic hazard zone, as determined pursuant to Section 2696, unless the applicable general plan or zoning ordinance contains provisions to mitigate the risk of an earthquake fault or seismic hazard zone.
(5) Landslide hazard, flood plain, flood way, or restriction zone, unless the applicable general plan or zoning ordinance contains provisions to mitigate the risk of a landslide or flood.
(i) (1) The project site is not located on developed open space.
(2) For the purposes of this subdivision, “developed open space” means land that meets all of the following criteria:
(A) Is publicly owned, or financed in whole or in part by public funds.
(B) Is generally open to, and available for use by, the public.
(C) Is predominantly lacking in structural development other than structures associated with open spaces, including, but not limited to, playgrounds, swimming pools, ballfields, enclosed child play areas, and picnic facilities.
(3) For the purposes of this subdivision, “developed open space” includes land that has been designated for acquisition by a public agency for developed open space, but does not include lands acquired by public funds dedicated to the acquisition of land for housing purposes.","The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) generally requires all state and local governmental lead agencies to prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on any discretionary project that they propose to carry out or approve that may result in a significant effect on the environment, that is, a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the physical conditions that exist within the area that will be affected by the project. Under existing law, a housing project qualifies for an exemption from CEQA if certain requirements are met, including the requirement that the site is not located within the boundaries of a state conservancy.
This bill would eliminate the requirement that the site not be located within the boundaries of a state conservancy.","An act to amend Section 21159.21 of the Public Resources Code, relating to the California Environmental Quality Act."

SECTION 1.
Section 1347.1 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
1347.1.
(a) In any criminal proceeding in which a defendant is charged with a violation of Section 236.1, upon written notice by the prosecutor made at least three days prior to the date of the preliminary hearing or trial date on which the testimony of the minor is scheduled, or during the course of the proceeding on the court’s own motion, may order that the testimony of a minor 15 years of age or younger at the time of the motion be taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys, and communicated to the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television, if the court makes all of the following findings:
(1) The minor’s testimony will involve a recitation of the facts of an alleged offense of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1.
(2) (A) The impact on the minor of one or more of the factors enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), inclusive, is shown by clear and convincing evidence to be so substantial as to make the minor unavailable as a witness unless closed-circuit testimony is used.
(i) Testimony by the minor in the presence of the defendant would result in the minor suffering serious emotional distress so that the minor would be unavailable as a witness.
(ii) The defendant used a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense.
(iii) The defendant threatened serious bodily injury to the minor or the minor’s family, threatened incarceration or deportation of the minor or a member of the minor’s family, threatened removal of the minor from the minor’s family, or threatened the dissolution of the minor’s family in order to prevent or dissuade the minor from attending or giving testimony at any trial or court proceeding, or to prevent the minor from reporting the alleged sexual offense, or from assisting in criminal prosecution.
(iv) The defendant inflicted great bodily injury upon the minor in the commission of the offense.
(v) The defendant or his or her counsel behaved during the hearing or trial in a way that caused the minor to be unable to continue his or her testimony.
(B) In making the determination required by this paragraph, the court shall consider the age of the minor, the relationship between the minor and the defendant or defendants, any handicap or disability of the minor, and the nature of the acts charged. The minor’s refusal to testify shall not alone constitute sufficient evidence that the special procedure described in this section is necessary to obtain the minor’s testimony.
(3) The equipment available for use of closed-circuit television would accurately communicate the image and demeanor of the minor to the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys.
(b) If the court orders the use of closed-circuit television, two-way closed-circuit television shall be used, except that if the impact on the minor of one or more of the factors enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), inclusive, of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), is shown by clear and convincing evidence to be so substantial as to make the minor unavailable as a witness even if two-way closed-circuit television is used, one-way closed-circuit television may be used. The prosecution shall give the defendant or defendants at least 30 days’ written notice of the prosecution’s intent to seek the use of one-way closed-circuit television, unless the prosecution shows good cause to the court why this 30-day notice requirement should not apply.
(c) (1) The hearing on a motion brought pursuant to this section shall be conducted out of the presence of the jury.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 804 of the Evidence Code or any other law, the court, in determining the merits of the motion, shall not compel the minor to testify at the hearing, nor shall the court deny the motion on the ground that the minor has not testified.
(3) In determining whether the impact on an individual minor of one or more of the five factors enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), inclusive, of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) is so substantial that the minor is unavailable as a witness unless two-way or one-way closed-circuit television is used, the court may question the minor in chambers, or at some other comfortable place other than the courtroom, on the record for a reasonable period of time with the support person, the prosecutor, and defense counsel present. The defendant or defendants shall not be present. The court shall conduct the questioning of the minor and shall not permit the prosecutor or defense counsel to examine the minor. The prosecutor and defense counsel shall be permitted to submit proposed questions to the court prior to the session in chambers. Defense counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with the defendant or defendants prior to the conclusion of the session in chambers.
(d) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside of the courtroom, the court shall do all of the following:
(1) Make a brief statement on the record, outside of the presence of the jury, of the reasons in support of its order. While the statement need not include traditional findings of fact, the reasons shall be set forth with sufficient specificity to permit meaningful review and to demonstrate that discretion was exercised in a careful, reasonable, and equitable manner.
(2) Instruct the members of the jury that they are to draw no inferences from the use of closed-circuit television as a means of facilitating the testimony of the minor.
(3) Instruct respective counsel, outside of the presence of the jury, that they are to make no comment during the course of the trial on the use of closed-circuit television procedures.
(4) Instruct the support witness, outside of the presence of the jury, that he or she is not to coach, cue, or in any way influence or attempt to influence the testimony of the minor.
(5) Order that a complete record of the examination of the minor, including the images and voices of all persons who in any way participate in the examination, be made and preserved as a video recording in addition to being stenographically recorded. The video recording shall be transmitted to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending and shall be made available for viewing to the prosecuting attorney, the defendant or defendants, and his or her attorney during ordinary business hours. The video recording shall be destroyed after five years have elapsed from the date of entry of judgment. If an appeal is filed, the video recording shall not be destroyed until a final judgment on appeal has been ordered. A video recording that is taken pursuant to this section is subject to a protective order of the court for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the witness. This subdivision does not affect the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 868.7.
(e) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, only the minor, a support person designated pursuant to Section 868.5, a nonuniformed bailiff, any technicians necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and, after consultation with the prosecution and the defense, a representative appointed by the court, shall be physically present for the testimony. A video recording device shall record the image of the minor and his or her testimony, and a separate video recording device shall record the image of the support person.
(f) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, the minor shall be brought into the judge’s chambers prior to the taking of his or her testimony to meet for a reasonable period of time with the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel. A support person for the minor shall also be present. This meeting shall be for the purpose of explaining the court process to the minor and to allow the attorneys an opportunity to establish rapport with the minor to facilitate later questioning by closed-circuit television. A participant shall not discuss the defendant or defendants or any of the facts of the case with the minor during this meeting.
(g) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, this section does not prohibit the court from ordering the minor to be brought into the courtroom for a limited purpose, including the identification of the defendant or defendants as the court deems necessary.
(h) The examination shall be under oath, and the defendant or defendants shall be able to see and hear the minor witness, and if two-way closed-circuit television is used, the defendant’s image shall be transmitted live to the witness.
(i) This section does not affect the disqualification of witnesses pursuant to Section 701 of the Evidence Code.
(j) The cost of examination by contemporaneous closed-circuit television ordered pursuant to this section shall be borne by the court out of its existing budget.
(k) This section shall not be construed to prohibit a defendant from being represented by counsel during any closed-circuit testimony.","Existing law authorizes a court in a criminal proceeding, upon written notice by the prosecutor made at least 3 days prior to the date of the preliminary hearing or trial date on which the testimony of the minor is scheduled or during the course of the proceeding on the court’s own motion, to order that the testimony of a minor 13 years of age or younger at the time of the motion be taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys, and communicated to the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television, if the court makes specified findings. One of the findings required by existing law requires is that the minor’s testimony will involve a recitation of the facts of specified crimes, including an alleged violent felony of which the minor is a victim.
This bill would authorize, under specified conditions, a minor 15 years of age or younger to testify by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys if the testimony will involve the recitation of the facts of an alleged offense of human trafficking.","An act to add Section 1347.1 to the Penal Code, relating to criminal procedure."

SECTION 1.
Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 4650) is added to Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, to read:
CHAPTER  10.7. Music Therapy
4650.
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Music Therapy Act.
4651.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Existing national certification of music therapist requires the therapist to have graduated with a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, or higher, from a music therapy degree program approved by the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA), successful completion of a minimum of 1,200 hours of supervised clinical work through preinternship training at an approved degree program, and internship training through approved national roster or university affiliated internship programs, or an equivalent.
(b) Upon successful completion of the AMTA academic and clinical training requirements or its international equivalent, an individual is eligible to sit for the national board certification exam administered by the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT), an independent, nonprofit corporation fully accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies.
(c) The CBMT grants the Music Therapist-Board Certified (MT-BC) credential to music therapists who have demonstrated the knowledge, skills, and abilities for competence in the current practice of music therapy. The purpose of board certification in music therapy is to provide an objective national standard that can be used as a measure of professionalism and competence by interested agencies, groups, and individuals.
(d) The MT-BC is awarded by the CBMT to an individual upon successful completion of an academic and clinical training program approved by the AMTA or an international equivalent and successful completion of an objective written examination demonstrating current competency in the profession of music therapy. The CBMT administers this examination, which is based on a nationwide music therapy practice analysis that is reviewed and updated every five years to reflect current clinical practice.
(e) Once certified, a music therapist must adhere to the CBMT Code of Professional Practice and recertify every five years through either a program of continuing education or reexamination.
4652.
It is the intent of the Legislature that this chapter do the following:
(a) Provide a statutory definition of music therapy.
(b) Enable consumers and state and local agencies to more easily identify qualified music therapists.
4653.
As used in this chapter:
(a) “Music therapy” means the clinical and evidence-based use of music therapy interventions in developmental, rehabilitative, habilitative, medical, mental health, preventive, wellness care, or educational settings to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals within a therapeutic relationship. Music therapy includes the following:
(1) The development of music therapy treatment plans specific to the needs and strengths of the client who may be seen individually or in groups.
(2) Music therapy plans shall establish goals, objectives, and potential strategies of the music therapy services appropriate for the client and setting.
(b) “Music therapy interventions” include, but are not limited to, music improvisation, receptive music listening, song writing, lyric discussion, music and imagery, singing, music performance, learning through music, music combined with other arts, music-assisted relaxation, music-based patient education, electronic music technology, adapted music intervention, and movement to music.
4654.
An individual who provides music therapy shall not refer to himself or herself using the title of “Board Certified Music Therapist” unless the individual has completed all of the following:
(a) A bachelors degree or its equivalent, or higher, from a music therapy degree program approved by the American Music Therapy Association using current standards, beginning with those adopted on April 1, 2015.
(b) A minimum of 1,200 hours of supervised clinical work through preinternship training at an approved degree program and internship training through an approved national roster or university affiliated internship program, or the equivalent.
(c) The current requirements for certification, beginning with those adopted on April 1, 2015, established by the CBMT for the MT-BC credential.
4655.
This chapter shall not be construed to authorize a person engaged in music therapy to state or imply that he or she provides mental health counseling, psychotherapy, or occupational therapy for which a license is required under this division. While the use of music is not restricted to any profession, the use of music shall not imply or suggest that the person is a Board Certified Music Therapist, if he or she does not meet the criteria specified in Section 4654.
4656.
It is an unfair business practice within the meaning of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 2 of Division 7, for a person to use the title “Board Certified Music Therapist” if he or she does not meet the requirements of Section 4654.","Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various healing arts practitioners by boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs.
Existing law defines “unfair competition” to mean and include any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising. Under existing law, a person who engages in unfair competition is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each violation.
Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties over the regulation of health facilities and adult day health care centers, including, but not limited to, adopting regulations setting forth applicable staffing standards. Existing regulations of the department applicable to intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled and for adult day health care centers define “music therapist” as a person who has a bachelor’s degree in music therapy and who is registered or eligible for registration by the National Association for Music Therapy, now known as the American Music Therapy Association.
This bill would prohibit a person who provides music therapy, as defined, from using the title of “Board Certified Music Therapist” unless the person has completed specified education and clinical training requirements. The bill would also establish that it is an unfair business practice for a person to use the title “Board Certified Music Therapist” if he or she does not meet those requirements. The bill would prohibit its provisions from being construed to authorize a person engaged in music therapy to state or imply that he or she provides mental health counseling, psychotherapy, or occupational therapy for which a license is required and provide that use of music therapy shall not imply or suggest that the person is a Board Certified Music Therapist, if he or she does not meet specified criteria.","An act to add Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 4650) to Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to music therapy."

(h) “District” also includes the South Coast Air Quality Management District, a new public agency created on February 1, 1977, pursuant to Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 40400) of Part 3 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code.
(1) Employees of the South Coast Air Quality Management District shall be deemed to be employees of a new public agency occupying new positions on February 1, 1977. On that date, those new positions are deemed not to have been covered by any retirement system.
(2) No retirement system coverage may be effected for an employee of the South Coast Air Quality Management District who commenced employment with the district during the period commencing on February 1, 1977, and ending on December 31, 1978, unless and until the employee shall have elected whether to become a member of the retirement association established in accordance with this chapter for employees of Los Angeles County or the retirement association established in accordance with this chapter for employees of San Bernardino County.

Existing law defines a district for these purposes and includes specified county retirement systems within the definition.
This bill would include the retirement system established under these provisions in the County of Ventura within the definition of district.
The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 also authorizes the board of retirement, in a county in which the board has appointed administrative, technical, and clerical staff personnel, to also appoint other administrators, managers, and legal counsel, as specified. These appointees are not classified as county employees and are therefor not subject to the civil service system, but are employees of the retirement system subject to the terms of employment determined by the board of retirement.
This bill would authorize the board of retirement of Ventura County to appoint a retirement administrator, chief financial officer, chief operations officer, chief investment officer, and general counsel. The bill would require these appointees to be employees of the retirement system, and not of the county, and subject to terms and conditions of employment established by the board of retirement. The bill would provide that the compensation of these appointees is an expense of the administration of the retirement system. The bill would grant the board of retirement and the board of supervisors authority to enter into agreements necessary to implement its provisions and would except the retirement system from specified requirements relating to retirement administrators. The bill would provide that these provisions apply to the Ventura County retirement system only upon adoption of a specified resolution by the board of retirement. The bill would make conforming changes.","An act to amend Sections 31468, 31557.3, and 31580.2 of, and to add Section 31522.10 to, the Government Code, relating to retirement."
777,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 19130 of the Government Code is amended to read:
19130.
The purpose of this article is to establish standards for the use of personal services contracts.
(a) Personal services contracting is permissible to achieve cost savings when all the following conditions are met:
(1) The contracting agency clearly demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the state, provided that:
(A) In comparing costs, there shall be included the state’s additional cost of providing the same service as proposed by a contractor. These additional costs shall include the salaries and benefits of additional staff that would be needed and the cost of additional space, equipment, and materials needed to perform the function.
(B) In comparing costs, there shall not be included the state’s indirect overhead costs unless these costs can be attributed solely to the function in question and would not exist if that function was not performed in state service. Indirect overhead costs shall mean the pro rata share of existing administrative salaries and benefits, rent, equipment costs, utilities, and materials.
(C) In comparing costs, there shall be included in the cost of a contractor providing a service any continuing state costs that would be directly associated with the contracted function. These continuing state costs shall include, but not be limited to, those for inspection, supervision, and monitoring.
(2) Proposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits. Proposals to contract out work shall be eligible for approval if the contractor’s wages are at the industry’s level and do not significantly undercut state pay rates.
(3) The contract does not cause the displacement of civil service employees. The term “displacement” includes layoff, demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. Displacement does not include changes in shifts or days off, nor does it include reassignment to other positions within the same class and general location.
(4) The contract does not adversely affect the state’s affirmative action efforts.
(5) The savings shall be large enough to ensure that they will not be eliminated by private sector and state cost fluctuations that could normally be expected during the contracting period.
(6) The amount of savings clearly justify the size and duration of the contracting agreement.
(7) The contract is awarded through a publicized, competitive bidding process.
(8) The contract includes specific provisions pertaining to the qualifications of the staff that will perform the work under the contract, as well as assurance that the contractor’s hiring practices meet applicable nondiscrimination, affirmative action standards.
(9) The potential for future economic risk to the state from potential contractor rate increases is minimal.
(10) The contract is with a firm. A “firm” means a corporation, partnership, nonprofit organization, or sole proprietorship.
(11) The potential economic advantage of contracting is not outweighed by the public’s interest in having a particular function performed directly by state government.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (d), personal services contracting also shall be permissible when any of the following conditions can be met:
(1) The functions contracted are exempted from civil service by Section 4 of Article VII of the California Constitution, which describes exempt appointments.
(2) The contract is for a new state function and the Legislature has specifically mandated or authorized the performance of the work by independent contractors.
(3) The services contracted are not available within civil service, cannot be performed satisfactorily by civil service employees, or are of such a highly specialized or technical nature that the necessary expert knowledge, experience, and ability are not available through the civil service system.
(4) The services are incidental to a contract for the purchase or lease of real or personal property. Contracts under this criterion, known as “service agreements,” shall include, but not be limited to, agreements to service or maintain office equipment or computers that are leased or rented.
(5) The legislative, administrative, or legal goals and purposes cannot be accomplished through the utilization of persons selected pursuant to the regular civil service system. Contracts are permissible under this criterion to protect against a conflict of interest or to insure independent and unbiased findings in cases where there is a clear need for a different, outside perspective. These contracts shall include, but not be limited to, obtaining expert witnesses in litigation.
(6) The nature of the work is such that the Government Code standards for emergency appointments apply. These contracts shall conform with Article 8 (commencing with Section 19888) of Chapter 2.5 of Part 2.6.
(7) State agencies need private counsel because a conflict of interest on the part of the Attorney General’s office prevents it from representing the agency without compromising its position. These contracts shall require the written consent of the Attorney General, pursuant to Section 11040.
(8) The contractor will provide equipment, materials, facilities, or support services that could not feasibly be provided by the state in the location where the services are to be performed.
(9) The contractor will conduct training courses for which appropriately qualified civil service instructors are not available, provided that permanent instructor positions in academies or similar settings shall be filled through civil service appointment.
(10) The services are of such an urgent, temporary, or occasional nature that the delay incumbent in their implementation under civil service would frustrate their very purpose.
(c) All persons who provide services to the state under conditions the board determines constitute an employment relationship shall, unless exempted from civil service by Section 4 of Article VII of the California Constitution, be retained under an appropriate civil service appointment.
(d) A personal services contract otherwise permitted pursuant to subdivision (b) is prohibited if it would cause the displacement of civil service employees. For the purposes of this subdivision, “displacement” includes layoff, demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. Displacement does not include changes in shifts or days off, nor does it include reassignment to other positions within the same class and general location.","The California Constitution provides that the civil service includes every officer and employee in the state except as otherwise provided in the Constitution. Existing law, the State Civil Service Act, however, permits the use of personal services contracts by state agencies if specified conditions are met. In this regard, a state agency may use a personal service contract to achieve cost savings if, among other conditions, the contract does not cause the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees. Existing law also permits the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, including during emergencies, if the contract is for a new state function and the Legislature has mandated or authorized the performance of work by independent contractors, or to protect against a conflict of interest, among others.
This bill would make the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, as described above, conditional on the contract not causing the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees.","An act to amend Section 19130 of the Government Code, relating to civil service."

Article  6. Craft Distiller’s Licenses
23500.
This act shall be known, and may be referenced as, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015.
23501.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The regulation and licensing of the sale of alcoholic beverages in this state has operated for over 80 years under what is commonly referred to as the “three-tier system,” which generally prohibits vertical integration within the distilled spirits industry. This system has helped in protecting against undue marketing influences within the distilled spirits industry and assisted the goals of promoting temperance and reasonable regulation of the sale of distilled spirits within the state. In addition, this system has helped create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development within California.
(b) Small craft distillers have begun to operate in this state, and these craft distillers have begun to increase employment and provide jobs and economic development in various locations within the state.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to encourage the development of the craft distilling industry within the state by enacting various limited exemptions to the general provisions of the three-tier system, while also continuing to uphold and support the three-tier system as the appropriate mechanism for regulating and licensing the sale of distilled spirits in California.
23502.
(a) The department may issue a craft distiller’s license to a person that has facilities and equipment for the purposes of, and is engaged in, the commercial manufacture of distilled spirits. The craft distiller’s license authorizes the licensee to do all of the following:
(1) Manufacture distilled spirits. A licensed craft distiller may manufacture up to 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year (July 1 through June 30), excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, as reported to the department in the manner prescribed by the department for the fiscal year prior to the date of submitting an application for the license.
(2) Package, rectify, mix, flavor, color, label, and export only those distilled spirits manufactured by the licensee.
(3) Only sell distilled spirits that are manufactured and packaged by the licensee solely to a wholesaler, manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, or rectifier that holds a license authorizing the sale of distilled spirits or to persons that take delivery of those distilled spirits within this state for delivery or use without the state.
(4) Deal in warehouse receipts.
(b) A craft distiller’s license shall not be issued to any person, any officer, director, employee, or agent of such person, or any person who is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a person that manufactures or has manufactured for them more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per year within or without the state, excluding brandy it manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, or to any person that is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a wholesaler.
(c) (1) The fee for an original craft distiller’s license issued pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer’s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.
(2) The annual license fee for a craft distiller’s license shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer’s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.

(d) A licensed craft distiller shall report to the department, at the time of renewal in the manner prescribed by the department, the amount of distilled spirits manufactured, excluding brandy manufactured by or for the licensee pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, during the previous fiscal year. If the report to the department establishes that the licensee no longer qualifies to hold a craft distiller’s license, the department shall renew the license as a distilled spirits manufacturer’s license.

Notwithstanding any other provision, a licensed craft distiller may sell up to the equivalent of 2.25 liters in any combination of prepackaged containers per day per consumer of distilled spirits manufactured by the licensee at its premises to a consumer attending an instructional tasting conducted by the licensee on its licensed premises pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 23363.1.
23506.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, a licensed craft distiller or one or more of its direct or indirect subsidiaries of which the licensed craft distiller owns not less than a 51-percent interest, who manufactures or produces, bottles, processes, imports, or sells distilled spirits under a craft distiller’s license or any other license issued pursuant to this division, or any officer or director of, or any person holding any interest in, those persons may serve as an officer or director of, and may hold the ownership of any interest or any financial or representative relationship in, any on-sale license, or the business conducted under that license, provided that, except in the case of a holder of on-sale general licenses for airplanes and duplicate on-sale general licenses for air common carriers, all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The on-sale licensee purchases all alcoholic beverages sold and served only from California wholesale licensees.
(2) The number of distilled spirits items by brand offered for sale by the on-sale licensee that are manufactured, produced, bottled, processed, imported, or sold by the licensed craft distiller or by the subsidiary of which the licensed craft distiller owns not less than 51 percent, or by any officer or director of, or by any person holding any interest in, those persons does not exceed 15 percent of the total distilled spirits items by brand listed and offered for sale by the on-sale licensee selling and serving that distilled spirit. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), distilled spirits sold pursuant to this provision may be purchased from a California licensed craft distiller so long as the distilled spirits purchased are produced or bottled by, or produced and packaged for, the same licensed craft distiller that holds an interest in the on-sale license and such direct sales do not involve more than two on-sale licenses in which the licensed craft distiller or any person holding an interest in the licensed craft distiller holds any interest, directly or indirectly, either individually or in combination or together with each other in the aggregate.
(3) None of the persons specified in this section may have any of the interests specified in this section in more than two on-sale licenses.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, a licensed craft distiller that has an interest in one or more on-sale retail licenses pursuant to this section may continue to hold that interest in the event the licensee no longer qualifies as a craft distiller, provided that the interest was first obtained at a time when the licensee did hold a craft distiller’s license pursuant to Section 23502.
(c) A craft distiller licensee may sell all beers, wines, brandies, or distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises in a bona fide eating place as defined in Section 23038, which is located on the licensed premises or on premises owned by the licensee that are contiguous licensed premises and which is operated by and for the licensee, provided that any alcoholic beverage products not manufactured or produced by the licensee must be purchased from a licensed wholesaler. Beer, wine, and brandy may be used in the preparation of food and beverages in the bona fide public eating place for consumption on the premises.
23508.
(a) A licensed craft distiller may also have upon its licensed premises all beers, wines, and distilled spirits, regardless of source, for sale or service only to guests during private events or private functions not open to the general public. Alcoholic beverage products sold at the premises that are not manufactured or produced and bottled by, or manufactured or produced and packaged for, the licensed craft distiller shall be purchased by the licensed craft distiller only from a licensed wholesaler.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, in the event that the licensee no longer qualifies as a craft distiller due to the amount of distilled spirits reported pursuant to Section 23502, the licensee may continue to hold the privileges granted by this section.

(b) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the financial or representative relationship between a manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, rectifier, distiller, bottler, importer, or wholesaler, or any officer, director, or agent of that person, and a person holding only one of the following types of licenses:
(1) On-sale general license for a bona fide club.
(2) Club license (issued under Article 4 (commencing at Section 23425) of Chapter 3).
(3) Veterans’ club license (issued under Article 5 (commencing at Section 23450) of Chapter 3).
(4) On-sale license for boats, trains, sleeping cars, or airplanes where the alcoholic beverages produced or sold by the manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, rectifier, bottler, importer, or wholesaler or any officer, director, or agent of that person are not sold, furnished, or given, directly or indirectly, to the on-sale licensee.","The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act contains various provisions regulating the application for, the issuance of, the suspension of, and the conditions imposed upon, alcoholic beverage licenses by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Existing law provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending upon the type of license issued.
This bill, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015, would authorize the department to issue a craft distiller’s license to manufacture distilled spirits, subject to specified conditions, including that the licensee manufacture no more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year, excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them. The bill would allow the craft distiller’s licensee to sell distilled spirits to specified consumers, to own interests in on-sale retail licenses, and to sell beer, wines, brandies, and distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises of a bona fide eating place, as provided. The bill would impose an original fee and an annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed distilled spirits manufacturer to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on the licensed premises, under specified conditions, including that tasting not be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink.

SECTION 1.
Section 9114 of the Elections Code is amended to read:
9114.
Except as provided in Section 9115, within 30 days from the date of filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the elections official shall examine the petition, and from the records of registration ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters. A certificate showing the results of this examination shall be attached to the petition.
In determining the number of valid signatures, the elections official may use the duplicate file of affidavits maintained, or may check the signatures against facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law.
The elections official shall notify the proponents of the petition as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.
If the petition is found insufficient, no further action shall be taken. However, the failure to secure sufficient signatures, shall not preclude the filing of a new petition on the same subject, at a later date.
If the petition is found sufficient, the elections official shall immediately place the initiative measure that is the subject of the petition on the election ballot for which it qualifies pursuant to Section 1405, and certify the results of the examination to the board of supervisors at the next regular meeting of the board. If more than one election date is legally available, the elections official shall place the measure on the ballot for the earliest legally possible date unless the board of supervisors by resolution chooses a different legally possible date pursuant to Section 9116, 9118, 9214, 9215, 9310, or 9311. The measure shall not be removed from the ballot on which it has been placed under the procedures set forth above unless the elections official is notified in writing that the board of supervisors has adopted the measure without alteration, or the elections official is ordered to remove the measure via writ of mandate or injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

9115.
(a) Within 30 days from the date of filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, if, from the examination of petitions pursuant to Section 9114 shows that more than 500 signatures have been signed on the petition, the elections official may use a random sampling technique for verification of signatures. The random sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn so that every signature filed with the elections official shall be given an equal opportunity to be included in the sample. The random sampling shall include an examination of at least 500, or 3 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater.
(b) If the statistical sampling shows that the number of valid signatures is within 95 to 110 percent of the number of signatures of qualified voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the elections official shall, within 60 days from the date of the filing of the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, examine and verify the signatures filed. If the elections official determines, prior to completing the examination of each signature filed, that the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified voters to declare the petition sufficient, the elections official may terminate the verification of the remaining unverified signatures.
(c) In determining from the records of registration, what number of valid signatures are signed on the petition, the elections official may use the duplicate file of affidavits maintained, or may check the signatures against facsimiles of voters’ signatures, provided that the method of preparing and displaying the facsimiles complies with law.
(d) The elections official shall attach to the petition a certificate showing the result of this examination and shall notify the proponents of either the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.
(e) If the petition is found insufficient, no action shall be taken on the petition. However, the failure to secure sufficient signatures shall not preclude the filing later of an entirely new petition to the same effect.
(f) If the petition is found to be sufficient, the elections official shall immediately place the initiative measure that is the subject of the petition on the election ballot for which it qualifies pursuant to Section 1405, and certify the results of the examination to the board of supervisors at the next regular meeting of the board.

Existing law requires the elections official to examine the petitions, and from the records of registration ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters. If the petition is found sufficient, the elections official is required to certify the results of the examination to the appropriate legislative body.
This bill would additionally require the elections official to immediately place the initiative measure on the election ballot for which it qualifies if the official finds the petition to be sufficient. If more than one election date is legally possible, the official would be required to place the measure on the ballot for the earliest legally possible date, unless as specified. The bill would apply this procedure to municipal, county, and district initiative measures, including city and city and county charter proposals, and to municipal referendum measures. The bill also would make a technical change.
By imposing new requirements on local elections officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.

SECTION 1.
Section 14714 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
14714.
(a) (1) Except as otherwise specified in this chapter, a contract entered into pursuant to this chapter shall include a provision that the mental health plan contractor shall bear the financial risk for the cost of providing medically necessary specialty mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.
(2) If the mental health plan is not administered by a county, the mental health plan shall not transfer the obligation for any specialty mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries to the county. The mental health plan may purchase services from the county. The mental health plan shall establish mutually agreed-upon protocols with the county that clearly establish conditions under which beneficiaries may obtain non-Medi-Cal reimbursable services from the county. Additionally, the plan shall establish mutually agreed-upon protocols with the county for the conditions of transfer of beneficiaries who have lost Medi-Cal eligibility to the county for care under Part 2 (commencing with Section 5600), Part 3 (commencing with Section 5800), and Part 4 (commencing with Section 5850) of Division 5.
(3) The mental health plan shall be financially responsible for ensuring access and a minimum required scope of benefits and services, consistent with state and federal requirements, to Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are residents of that county regardless of where the beneficiary resides, except as provided for in Section 14717.1. The department shall require that the same definition of medical necessity be used, and the minimum scope of benefits offered by each mental health plan be the same, except to the extent that prior federal approval is received and is consistent with state and federal laws.
(b) (1) Any contract entered into pursuant to this chapter may be renewed if the mental health plan continues to meet the requirements of this chapter, regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter, and the terms and conditions of the contract. Failure to meet these requirements shall be cause for nonrenewal of the contract. The department may base the decision to renew on timely completion of a mutually agreed-upon plan of correction of any deficiencies, submissions of required information in a timely manner, or other conditions of the contract.
(2) In the event the contract is not renewed based on the reasons specified in paragraph (1), the department shall notify the Department of Finance, the fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature, and the Controller of the amounts to be sequestered from the Mental Health Subaccount, the Mental Health Equity Account, and the Vehicle License Fee Collection Account of the Local Revenue Fund and the Mental Health Account and the Behavioral Health Subaccount of the Local Revenue Fund 2011, and the Controller shall sequester those funds in the Behavioral Health Subaccount pursuant to Section 30027.10 of thetion and notification to affected beneficiaries. The plan may request a hearing by the Office of Administrative Hearings and Appeals.
(e) A mental health plan may terminate its contract in accordance with the provisions in the contract. The mental health plan shall provide written notice to the department at least 180 days prior to the termination or nonrenewal of the contract.
(f) Upon the request of the director, the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care may exempt a mental health plan from the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code). These exemptions may be subject to conditions the director deems appropriate. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or diminish the authority of the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to reduce or otherwise limit the obligation of a mental health plan contractor licensed as a health care service plan to comply with the requirements of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, and the rules of the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care promulgated under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The director, in consultation with the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care, shall analyze the appropriateness of licensure or application of applicable standards of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975.
(g) The department shall provide oversight to the mental health plans to ensure quality, access, cost efficiency, and compliance with data and reporting requirements. At a minimum, the department shall, through a method independent of any agency of the mental health plan contractor, monitor the level and quality of services provided, expenditures pursuant to the contract, and conformity with federal and state law.
(h) County employees implementing or administering a mental health plan act in a discretionary capacity when they determine whether or not to admit a person for care or to provide any level of care pursuant to this chapter.
(i) If a county discontinues operations as the mental health plan, the department shall approve any new mental health plan. The new mental health plan shall give reasonable consideration to affiliation with nonprofit community mental health agencies that were under contract with the county and that meet the mental health plan’s quality and cost efficiency standards.
(j) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify, alter, or increase the obligations of counties as otherwise limited and defined in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 5700) of Part 2 of Division 5. The county’s maximum obligation for services to persons not eligible for Medi-Cal shall be no more than the amount of funds remaining in the mental health subaccount pursuant to Sections 17600, 17601, 17604, 17605, and 17609 after fulfilling the Medi-Cal contract obligations.

Section 14717.1 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
14717.1.
(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that foster children who are placed outside of their county of original jurisdiction are able to access specialty mental health services in a timely manner, consistent with their individual strengths and needs and the requirements of federal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) services.
(2) It is the further intent of the Legislature to overcome any barriers to care that may result when responsibility for providing or arranging for specialty mental health services to foster children who are placed outside of their county of original jurisdiction is retained by the county of original jurisdiction.
(b) In order to facilitate the receipt of medically necessary specialty mental health services by a foster child who is placed outside of his or her county of original jurisdiction, the California Health and Human Services Agency shall coordinate with the department and the State Department of Social Services to take all of the following actions on or before July 1, 2017:
(1) The department shall issue policy guidance concerning the conditions for and exceptions to presumptive transfer, as described in subdivisions (c) and (d), in consultation with the State Department of Social Services and with the input of stakeholders that include the County Welfare Directors Association of California, the Chief Probation Officers of California, the County Behavioral Health Directors Association of California, provider representatives, and family and youth advocates.
(2) Policy guidance concerning the conditions for and exceptions to presumptive transfer shall ensure that:
(A) The transfer of responsibility improves access to specialty mental health care services consistent with the mental health needs of the foster youth.
(B) Presumptive transfer does not disrupt the continuity of care.
(C) Conditions and exceptions are applied consistently statewide giving due consideration to the varying capabilities of small, medium, and large counties.
(D) Presumptive transfer can be waived only with an individualized determination that an exception applies.
(E) A party to the case who disagrees with the presumptive transfer individualized exception determination made by the county placing agency pursuant to subdivision (d) is afforded an opportunity to request judicial review prior to a transfer or exception being finalized.
(F) There is a procedure for expedited transfer within 48 hours of placement of the child outside of the county of original jurisdiction.
(c) “Presumptive transfer,” for the purposes of this section, means that absent any exceptions as established pursuant to this section, responsibility for providing or arranging for specialty mental health services shall promptly transfer from the county of original jurisdiction to the county in which the foster child resides, under either of the following conditions:
(1) A foster child is placed in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction on or after July 1, 2017.
(2) A foster youth who resides in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, and is not receiving specialty mental health services consistent with his or her mental health needs, requests transfer of responsibility. A foster child who resided in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, and who continues to reside outside the county of original jurisdiction after December 31, 2017, shall have jurisdiction transferred no later than the child’s first regularly scheduled status review hearing conducted pursuant to Section 366 in the 2018 calendar year unless an exception described under subdivision (d) applies.
(d) (1) On a case-by-case basis, and when consistent with the medical rights of children in foster care, presumptive transfer may be waived and the responsibility for the provision of specialty mental health services shall remain with the county of original jurisdiction if any of the exceptions described in paragraph (5) exist.
(2) A request for waiver in a manner established by the department may be made by the foster child, the person or agency that is responsible for making mental health care decisions on behalf of the foster child, the county probation agency or the child welfare services agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child, or any other interested party who owes a legal duty to the child involving the child’s health or welfare, as defined by the department.
(3) The county probation agency or the child welfare services agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child, in consultation with the child and his or her parent, the child and family team if one exists, and other professionals who serve the child as appropriate, is responsible for determining whether waiver of the presumptive transfer is appropriate pursuant to the conditions and exceptions established under this section. The person who requested the exception, along with any other parties to the case, shall receive notice of the county agency’s determination.
(4) The individual who requested the exception or any other party to the case who disagrees with the determination made by the county agency pursuant to paragraph (3) may request judicial review prior to the county’s determination becoming final. The court may set the matter for hearing and may confirm or deny the transfer of jurisdiction or application of an exception based on the best interest of the child.
(5) Presumptive transfer may be waived under any of the following exceptions:
(A) It is determined that the transfer would disrupt continuity of care or delay access to services provided to the foster child.
(B) It is determined that the transfer would interfere with family reunification efforts documented in the individual case plan.
(C) The foster child’s placement in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction is expected to last less than six months.
(D) The foster child’s residence is within 30 minutes of travel time to his or her established specialty mental health care provider in the county of original jurisdiction.
(6) A waiver processed based on an exception to presumptive transfer shall be contingent upon the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrating an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into a contract within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the foster child. That information shall be documented in the child’s case plan.
(7) A request for waiver, the exceptions claimed as the basis for the request, a determination whether a waiver is determined to be appropriate under this section, and any objections to the determination shall be documented in the foster child’s case plan pursuant to Section 16501.1.
(e) If the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction has completed an assessment of needed services for the foster child, the mental health plan in the county in which the foster child resides shall accept that assessment. The mental health plan in the county in which the foster child resides may conduct additional assessments if the foster child’s needs change or an updated assessment is needed to determine the child’s needs and identify the needed treatment and services to address those needs.
(f) Upon presumptive transfer, the mental health plan in the county in which the foster child resides shall assume responsibility for the authorization and provision of specialty mental health services and payments for services. The foster child transferred to the mental health plan in the county in which the foster child resides shall be considered part of the county of residence caseload for claiming purposes from the Behavioral Health Subaccount and the Behavioral Health Services Growth Special Account, both created pursuant to Section 30025 of the Government Code.
(g) The State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Health Care Services shall adopt regulations by July 1, 2019, to implement this section. Notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Health Care Services may implement and administer the changes made by this legislation through all-county letters, information notices, or similar written instructions until regulations are adopted.
(h) If the department determines it is necessary, it shall seek approval from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to implementing this section.
(i) If the department makes the determination that it is necessary to seek CMS approval pursuant to subdivision (h), the department shall make an official request for approval from CMS no later than January 1, 2017.
(j) This section shall be implemented only if and to the extent that federal financial participation under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396, et seq.) is available and all necessary federal approvals have been obtained.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services and Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) for any individual under 21 years of age are covered under Medi-Cal, consistent with the requirements of federal law. Federal law defines EPSDT to include screening services, vision services, dental services, hearing services, and other necessary services to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not the services are covered under the state plan. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services include EPSDT services provided to eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries under 21 years of age.
Existing law requires each local mental health plan to establish a procedure to ensure access to outpatient specialty mental health services, as required by the EPSDT program standards, for children in foster care who have been placed outside their county of adjudication. Existing law includes standardized contracts, procedures, documents, and forms, to facilitate the receipt of medically necessary specialty mental health services by a foster child who is placed outside his or her county of original jurisdiction.
This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to ensure that foster children who are placed outside of their county of original jurisdiction, are able to access mental health services in a timely manner consistent with their individualized strengths and needs and the requirements of EPSDT program standards and requirements. The bill would require the department to issue policy guidance that establishes the conditions for and exceptions to presumptive transfer of responsibility for providing or arranging for mental health services to a foster child from the county of original jurisdiction to the county in which the foster child resides, as prescribed. The bill would define presumptive transfer for these purposes. The bill would authorize any interested party who owes a legal duty to the child involving the child’s health or welfare to seek a waiver of presumptive transfer and would provide that the county probation agency or child welfare services agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child is responsible for determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate under specified conditions, including when a determination is made that the transfer of mental health services would disrupt continuity of care or timely access to services, as specified. The bill would require the mental health plan in the host county to assume responsibility for the authorization and provision of mental health services, and payments for services, upon the presumptive transfer. By increasing the responsibilities of county probation agencies or child welfare services agencies with respect to determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the department to seek approval from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to implementing these provisions if the department determines that approval is necessary. The bill would authorize the department and the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations to implement these provisions by July 1, 2019, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 14714 of, and to add Section 14717.1 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal."

SECTION 1.
Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 400) is added to Division 0.5 of the Elections Code, to read:
CHAPTER  5. State Preclearance
400.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Citizen” means a citizen of the United States.
(b) “Citizen voting-age population” means the population of citizens who are 18 years of age or older within a political subdivision, as calculated by the United States Census Bureau in the most recent federal decennial census.
(c) “Covered political subdivision” means a political subdivision with two or more racial or ethnic groups that each represent at least 20 percent of the citizen voting-age population in the political subdivision.
(d) “Electoral jurisdiction” means a geographic area within which reside the voters who are qualified to vote for an elective office.
(e) “Multilingual voting materials” means registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, provided in the language of one or more language minority groups.
(f) “Political subdivision” means a geographic area of representation created for the provision of government services, including, but not limited to, a city, a school district, a community college district, or other district organized pursuant to state law.
(g) “Protected class” means a class of voters who are members of a race, color, or language minority group, as this class is referenced and defined in the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 10101 et seq.).
(h) “Voting locations” means places for casting a ballot.
401.
To ensure that the right of citizens who reside in California to vote is not denied or abridged on account of race, color, or language minority status through the enforcement of a voting-related law, regulation, or policy that is enacted or administered after the enactment date of this chapter, the following voting-related laws, regulations, and policies shall be subject to this chapter:
(a) A change to an at-large method of election that adds offices elected at-large or converts offices elected by single-member districts to one or more at-large or multimember districts.
(b) A change to the boundaries of an electoral jurisdiction, or a series of changes within a year to the boundaries of an electoral jurisdiction, that reduces the proportion of the citizen voting-age population that are members of a single protected class by 5 or more percent.
(c) A change through redistricting that alters the boundaries of districts within an electoral jurisdiction in which a single protected class has experienced a population increase of at least 25,000 residents or at least 20 percent of the citizen voting-age population of the protected class over the preceding decade, as determined by the five-year estimates of the United States Census American Community Survey.
(d) A change to multilingual voting materials that reduces the voting materials available in languages other than English, or that alters the manner in which the materials are provided or distributed, if no similar reduction or alteration occurred in materials provided in English.
402.
(a) If a covered political subdivision enacts or seeks to administer a voting-related law, regulation, or policy described in Section 401 that is different from that in force or effect on the date this chapter is enacted, the governing body of the covered political subdivision shall submit the law, regulation, or policy to the Secretary of State for approval. The law, regulation, or policy shall not take effect or be administered in the covered political subdivision until the law, regulation, or policy is approved by the Secretary of State.
(b) The Secretary of State shall provide a written decision to the governing body of the covered political subdivision within 60 days of a request to enact or administer a voting-related law, regulation, or policy described in Section 401. If the Secretary of State fails to provide a written decision within 60 days, the governing body of the covered political subdivision may implement the law, regulation, or policy. The governing body of the covered political subdivision may make a written request for an expedited review of a law, regulation, or policy if the covered political subdivision has a demonstrated need to implement the proposed change before the end of the 60-day review period. The written request shall describe the basis for the request in light of conditions in the covered political subdivision and shall specify the date by which a decision is needed. The Secretary of State shall attempt to accommodate a reasonable request.
(c) The governing body of the covered political subdivision shall have the burden of establishing, by objective and compelling evidence, that the law, regulation, or policy satisfies both of the following:
(1) Is not likely to result in a discriminatory effect on the participation of voters from a protected class that constitutes at least 20 percent of the covered political subdivision’s citizen voting-age population.
(2) Is not motivated in whole or substantially in part by an intent to reduce the participation of voters from a protected class.
(d) If the Secretary of State denies a request to enact or administer a law, regulation, or policy, the governing body of the covered political subdivision may seek review of the decision by means of an action filed in superior court.
(e) The Secretary of State may file suit to enjoin the governing body of a covered political subdivision from implementing a law, regulation, or policy in violation of this section.
(f) Venue for an action filed pursuant to subdivision (d) or (e) shall lie exclusively in the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento.
(g) Notwithstanding any other law, a covered political subdivision may enact or administer a voting-related law, regulation, or policy described in Section 401 that is different from that in force or effect on the date this chapter is enacted if doing so is necessary because of an unexpected circumstance that occurred during the 30 days immediately preceding an election, in which case the covered political subdivision may enact or administer the law, regulation, or policy only for purposes of that election. After the election, the covered political subdivision shall immediately submit the law, regulation, or policy to the Secretary of State for approval pursuant to this section.
403.
(a) The Attorney General, or a registered voter who resides in a covered political subdivision where the change to a voting-related law, regulation, or policy occurred, may file an action in superior court to compel the covered political subdivision to satisfy the obligations set forth in this chapter.
(b) In an action brought pursuant to this section, a court shall provide as a remedy that the voting-related law, regulation, or policy be enjoined unless the court determines that the law, regulation, or policy is not subject to this chapter or has been approved by the procedures established in Section 402.
404.
For purposes of this chapter, any data provided by the United States Census Bureau, whether based on enumeration or statistical sampling, shall not be subject to challenge or review by any court.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, provides that a change in voting procedures may not take effect in a state or political subdivision that is covered by the preclearance requirements of the federal act until the change is approved by a specified federal authority. A state or political subdivision is covered by the preclearance requirements of the federal act if it maintained a specified test or device as a prerequisite to voting, and had low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s. The federal act allows a state or political subdivision covered by the act to obtain an exemption from the preclearance requirements if it satisfies specified criteria. The United States Supreme Court has held that the coverage formula of the federal act is unconstitutional and may not be used as a basis for requiring a jurisdiction to subject a proposed change in voting procedures to federal preclearance. Before that holding, the Counties of Kings, Monterey, and Yuba were covered jurisdictions subject to the federal preclearance requirements.
This bill would establish a state preclearance system. Under this system, if a covered political subdivision, as defined, enacts or seeks to administer a voting-related law, regulation, or policy, as specified, that is different from that in force or effect on the date this act is enacted, the governing body of the covered political subdivision would be required to submit the law, regulation, or policy to the Secretary of State for approval. The bill would require the Secretary of State to approve the law, regulation, or policy only if specified conditions are met. The bill would provide that the law, regulation, or policy will not take effect or be administered in the covered political subdivision until the law, regulation, or policy is approved by the Secretary of State, except as specified. The bill would allow the governing body of the covered political subdivision to seek review of the Secretary of State’s decision by means of an action filed in the Superior Court of Sacramento.
By requiring local governments to seek approval of the Secretary of State for changes to voting procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 400) to Division 0.5 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

SECTION 1.
Section 65961 of the Government Code is amended to read:
65961.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (f), upon approval or conditional approval of a tentative map for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units, or upon recordation of a parcel map for such a subdivision for which no tentative map was required, during the five-year period following recordation of the final map or parcel map for the subdivision, a city, county, or city and county shall not require as a condition to the issuance of any building permit or equivalent permit for such single- or multiple-family residential units, conformance with or the performance of any conditions that the city or county could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map. Nor shall a city, county, or city and county withhold or refuse to issue a building permit or equivalent permit for failure to conform with or perform any conditions that the city, county, or city and county could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map. However, the provisions of this section shall not prohibit a city, county, or city and county from doing any of the following:
(a) Imposing conditions or requirements upon the issuance of a building permit or equivalent permit which could have been lawfully imposed as a condition to the approval of a tentative or parcel map if the local agency finds it necessary to impose the condition or requirement for any of the following reasons:
(1) A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or of the immediate community, or both, in a condition perilous to their health or safety, or both.
(2) The condition is required in order to comply with state or federal law.
(b) Withholding or refusing to issue a building permit or equivalent permit if the local agency finds it is required to do so in order to comply with state or federal law.
(c) Assuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinance.
(d) This section shall also apply to a city or city and county which incorporates on or after January 1, 1985, and which includes within its boundaries any areas included in the tentative or parcel map described in this section.
When the incorporation includes areas included in the tentative or parcel map described in this section, “a condition that the city could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map,” as used in this section, refers to conditions the county could have imposed had there been no incorporation.
(e) For purposes only of a tentative subdivision map or parcel map that is extended pursuant to Section 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66452.25, the five-year period described in this section shall be three years.
(f) For purposes only of a tentative subdivision map or parcel map that is extended pursuant to Section 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66452.25, this section does not prohibit a city, county, or city and county from levying a fee or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee in the amount in effect upon the issuance of a building permit, including an adopted fee that is not included within an applicable zoning ordinance, upon the issuance of a building permit, including, but not limited to, a fee defined in Section 66000.

(a) If the map was approved within a county described in subdivision (c), the expiration date of a tentative map, vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which a tentative map or vesting tentative map, as the case may be, that was approved on or after January 1, 2002, and not later than July 11, 2013, and that has not expired on or before the effective date of the act that added this section, shall be extended by 24 months.
(b) If the map was approved or conditionally approved within a county described in subdivision (c), upon application of the subdivider filed at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map or vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which the tentative map or vesting tentative map, as the case may be, that was approved on or before December 31, 2001, the time at which the map expires shall be extended by the legislative body or by an advisory agency authorized to approve or conditionally approve tentative maps, for a period of 24 months upon a determination that the map is consistent with the applicable zoning and general plan requirements in effect when the application is filed. If the map is determined not to be consistent with applicable zoning and general plan requirements in effect when the application is filed, the legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months. Prior to the expiration of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map, upon an application by the subdivider to extend that map, the map shall automatically be extended for 60 days or until the application for the extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied, whichever occurs last. If the advisory agency denies a subdivider’s application for an extension, the subdivider may appeal to the legislative body within 15 days after the advisory agency has denied the extension.
(c) This section shall apply within a county when the following conditions within the county are met:
(1) The annual mean household income within the county is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual mean income, as determined by the most recent annual report of the federal American Community Survey 5-year Estimates, based upon the American Community Survey Design and Methodology publication (Version 2.0, January 2014) published by the United States Census Bureau.
(2) The annual nonseasonal unemployment rate is at least 2.75 percent higher than the statewide annual nonseasonal unemployment rate, as defined by the report on Labor Market Review published by the Employment Development Department in January of the year in which the community revitalization plan is prepared.

(d) The extension provided by subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be in addition to any extension of the expiration date provided for in Section 66452.6, 66452.11, 66452.13, 66452.21, 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66463.5.
(e) Any legislative, administrative, or other approval by any state agency that pertains to a development project included in a map that is extended pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be extended by 24 months if this approval has not expired on or before the effective date of the act that added this section. This extension shall be in addition to any extension provided for in Sections 66452.13, 66452.21, 66452.22, 66452.23, and 66452.24.
(f) The provisions of Section 65961 relating to conditions that may be imposed upon or after a building permit for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units or a parcel map for a subdivision for which no tentative map was required, are modified as set forth in subdivisions (e) and (f) of Section 65961 for tentative maps extended pursuant to this section.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to permit cities, counties, and cities and counties to preserve development applications that are set to expire and that cannot be processed presently due to prevailing adverse economic conditions in the construction industry, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","(1) The Subdivision Map Act vests the authority to regulate and control the design and improvement of subdivisions in the legislative body of a local agency, and sets forth procedures governing the local agency’s processing, approval, conditional approval or disapproval, and filing of tentative, final, and parcel maps, and the modification thereof. The act generally requires a subdivider to file a tentative map or vesting tentative map with the local agency, as specified, and the local agency, in turn, to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the map within a specified time period. The act requires an approved tentative map or vesting tentative map to expire 24 months after its approval, or after an additional period of time prescribed by local ordinance, not to exceed 12 months. However, the act extends the expiration date of certain approved tentative maps and vesting tentative maps, as specified.
This bill would extend by 24 months the expiration date of any approved tentative map or vesting tentative map that was approved on or after January 1, 2002, and not later than July 11, 2013, within a county that meets certain criteria, except as specified. The bill would additionally require the extension of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map or vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which a tentative map or vesting tentative map was approved on or before December 31, 2001, upon application by the subdivider at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the map, as specified. By adding to the procedures that local agency officials must follow, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The Permit Streamlining Act prohibits a local agency, after its approval of a tentative map for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units, from requiring conformance with, or the performance of, any conditions that the local agency could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map, as a condition to the issuance of any building permit or equivalent permit upon approval of that subdivision, during a 5-year period following the recordation of the final map or parcel map for that subdivision. The act also prohibits a local agency from refusing to issue a building permit or equivalent permit for a subdivider’s failure to conform with or perform those conditions. However, the act also provides that this 5-year period is a 3-year period for a tentative map extended pursuant to a specified provision of law, and the local agency is not prohibited from levying a fee, or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee upon the issuance of a building permit, with respect to the underlying units.
This bill would provide that a tentative map extended pursuant to its provisions is also subject to the truncated 3-year period described above, and that the local agency is not prohibited from levying a fee, as specified, or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee upon the issuance of a building permit, with respect to the underlying units. By adding to the procedures that local agency officials must follow, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 65961 of, and to add Section 66452.25 to, the Government Code, relating to land use, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
Section 786 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
786.
(a) If property taken in one jurisdictional territory by burglary, carjacking, robbery, theft, or embezzlement has been brought into another, or when property is received in one jurisdictional territory with the knowledge that it has been stolen or embezzled and the property was stolen or embezzled in another jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of the offense is in any competent court within either jurisdictional territory, or any contiguous jurisdictional territory if the arrest is made within the contiguous territory, the prosecution secures on the record the defendant’s knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of the right of vicinage, and the defendant is charged with one or more property crimes in the arresting territory.
(b) (1) The jurisdiction of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 530.55, shall also include the county where the theft of the personal identifying information occurred, the county in which the victim resided at the time the offense was committed, or the county where the information was used for an illegal purpose. If multiple offenses of unauthorized use of personal identifying information, either all involving the same defendant or defendants and the same personal identifying information belonging to the one person, or all involving the same defendant or defendants and the same scheme or substantially similar activity, occur in multiple jurisdictions, then any of those jurisdictions is a proper jurisdiction for all of the offenses. Jurisdiction also extends to all associated offenses connected together in their commission to the underlying identity theft offense or identity theft offenses.
(2) When charges alleging multiple offenses of unauthorized use of personal identifying information occurring in multiple territorial jurisdictions are filed in one county pursuant to this section, the court shall hold a hearing to consider whether the matter should proceed in the county of filing, or whether one or more counts should be severed. The district attorney filing the complaint shall present evidence to the court that the district attorney in each county where any of the charges could have been filed has agreed that the matter should proceed in the county of filing. In determining whether all counts in the complaint should be joined in one county for prosecution, the court shall consider the location and complexity of the likely evidence, where the majority of the offenses occurred, whether or not the offenses involved substantially similar activity or the same scheme, the rights of the defendant and the people, and the convenience of, or hardship to, the victim and witnesses.
(3) When an action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information is filed in the county in which the victim resided at the time the offense was committed, and no other basis for the jurisdiction applies, the court, upon its own motion or the motion of the defendant, shall hold a hearing to determine whether the county of the victim’s residence is the proper venue for trial of the case. In ruling on the matter, the court shall consider the rights of the parties, the access of the parties to evidence, the convenience to witnesses, and the interests of justice.
(c) (1) The jurisdiction of a criminal action for conduct specified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (j) of Section 647 shall also include the county in which the offense occurred, the county in which the victim resided at the time the offense was committed, or the county in which the intimate image was used for an illegal purpose. If multiple offenses of unauthorized distribution of an intimate image, either all involving the same defendant or defendants and the same intimate image belonging to the one person, or all involving the same defendant or defendants and the same scheme or substantially similar activity, occur in multiple jurisdictions, then any of those jurisdictions is a proper jurisdiction for all of the offenses. Jurisdiction also extends to all associated offenses connected together in their commission to the underlying unauthorized distribution of an intimate image.
(2) When charges alleging multiple offenses of unauthorized distribution of an intimate image occurring in multiple territorial jurisdictions are filed in one county pursuant to this section, the court shall hold a hearing to consider whether the matter should proceed in the county of filing, or whether one or more counts should be severed. The district attorney filing the complaint shall present evidence to the court that the district attorney in each county where any of the charges could have been filed has agreed that the matter should proceed in the county of filing. In determining whether all counts in the complaint should be joined in one county for prosecution, the court shall consider the location and complexity of the likely evidence, where the majority of the offenses occurred, whether the offenses involved substantially similar activity or the same scheme, the rights of the defendant and the people, and the convenience of, or hardship to, the victim and witnesses.
(3) When an action for unauthorized distribution of an intimate image is filed in the county in which the victim resided at the time the offense was committed, and no other basis for the jurisdiction applies, the court, upon its own motion or the motion of the defendant, shall hold a hearing to determine whether the county of the victim's residence is the proper venue for trial of the case. In ruling on the matter, the court shall consider the rights of the parties, the access of the parties to evidence, the convenience to witnesses, and the interests of justice.

(a) A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service, as used in Chapter 121 (commencing with Section 2701) of Title 18 of the United States Code, shall disclose to a governmental prosecuting or investigating agency the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other subscriber number or identity, and length of service of a subscriber to or customer of that service, the types of services the subscriber or customer utilized, and the contents of communication originated by or addressed to the service provider when the governmental entity is granted a search warrant pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1524.
(b) The search warrant shall be limited to only that information necessary to achieve the objective of the warrant, including by specifying the target individuals or accounts, the applications or services, the types of information, and the time periods covered, as appropriate.
(c) Information obtained through the execution of a search warrant pursuant to this section that is unrelated to the objective of the warrant shall be sealed and not be subject to further review without an order from the court.
(d) (1) A governmental entity receiving subscriber records or information under this section shall provide notice to a subscriber or customer upon receipt of the requested records. The notification may be delayed by the court, in increments of 90 days, upon a showing that there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of the search warrant may have an adverse result.
(2) An “adverse result” for purposes of paragraph (1) means any of the following:

(1) State the nature of the law enforcement inquiry with reasonable specificity.
(2) Inform the subscriber or customer that information maintained for the subscriber or customer by the service provider named in the process or request was supplied to or requested by the governmental entity, and the date upon which the information was supplied, and the request was made.
(3) Inform the subscriber or customer that notification to the subscriber or customer was delayed, and which court issued the order pursuant to which the notification was delayed.
(4) Provide a copy of the written inventory of the property that was taken that was provided to the court pursuant to Section 1537.
(f) A court issuing a search warrant pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1524, on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may quash or modify the warrant if the information or records requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with the warrant otherwise would cause an undue burden on the provider.
(g) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or a remote computing service, upon the request of a peace officer, shall take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a search warrant or a request in writing and an affidavit declaring an intent to file a warrant to the provider. Records shall be retained for a period of 90 days, which shall be extended for an additional 90-day period upon a renewed request by the peace officer.
(h) No cause of action shall be brought against any provider, its officers, employees, or agents for providing information, facilities, or assistance in good faith compliance with a search warrant.","Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to look through a hole or opening, into, or to view, by means of any instrumentality, the interior of an area in which an occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy with the intent to invade the privacy of that person. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to record another person under or through the clothing worn by that person, without the consent or knowledge of the person, under circumstances in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to secretly record another person in a state of full or partial undress without the consent or knowledge of that person, in an area in which that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally distribute an image of the intimate body part or parts of another person, or an image of the person depicted engaging in specified sexual acts, under circumstances in which the persons agree or understand that the image remain private, the person distributing the image knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause serious emotional distress, and the person depicted suffers that distress.
Existing law establishes the proper jurisdictions of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information to include the county where the theft occurred, the county in which the victim resided at the time of the offense, or the county where the information was used for an illegal purpose.
This bill would apply those jurisdictional provisions to the misdemeanors described above.
Existing law details procedures for a governmental entity to gather specified records from a provider of electronic communication service or a remote computing service by search warrant. Existing law specifies that no notice is required to be given to a subscriber or customer by a governmental entity receiving records pursuant to these procedures.
This bill would additionally authorize a governmental entity to use those procedures to gather the contents of communications between the subscriber and the service provider. The bill would require a search warrant used under those procedures to be limited to only that information necessary to achieve the objective of the warrant, as specified. The bill would require information obtained through the execution of a search warrant pursuant that is unrelated to the objective of the warrant to be sealed and not be subject to further review without an order from the court. The bill would require the governmental entity to provide a specified notice to the customer or subscriber upon receipt of the requested records. The bill would authorize a delay of that notice in 90-day increments if there is reason to believe notification would may have an adverse effect, as defined.","An act to amend Sections 786 and 1524.3 of the Penal Code, relating to disorderly conduct."

(C) An employer who has been provided notice pursuant to this section may not then enter into consultation with the division in order to avoid an action under this section.
(4) The superior court shall review and approve any proposed settlement of alleged violations of the provisions of Division 5 (commencing with Section 6300) to ensure that the settlement provisions are at least as effective as the protections or remedies provided by state and federal law or regulation for the alleged violation. The provisions of the settlement relating to health and safety laws shall be submitted to the division at the same time that they are submitted to the court. This requirement shall be construed to authorize and permit the division to comment on those settlement provisions, and the court shall grant the division’s commentary the appropriate weight.

If the alleged violation is not cured within the 33-day period, the employee may commence a civil action pursuant to Section 2699.
(B) (i) Subject to the limitation in clause (ii), no employer may avail himself or herself of the notice and cure provisions of this subdivision more than three times in a 12-month period for the same violation or violations contained in the notice, regardless of the location of the worksite.

(3) (A) If the aggrieved employee disputes that the alleged violation has been cured, the aggrieved employee or representative shall provide written notice by certified mail, including specified grounds to support that dispute, to the employer and the agency.
(B) Within 17 calendar days of the postmark date of that notice, the agency shall review the actions taken by the employer to cure the alleged violation, and provide written notice of its decision by certified mail to the aggrieved employee or representative and the employer. The agency may grant the employer three additional business days to cure the alleged violation. If the agency determines that the alleged violation has not been cured or if the agency fails to provide timely or any notification, the employee may proceed with the civil action pursuant to Section 2699. If the agency determines that the alleged violation has been cured, but the employee still disagrees, the employee may appeal that determination to the superior court.
(d) The periods specified in this section are not counted as part of the time limited for the commencement of the civil action to recover penalties under this part.

(f) (1) For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(A) “SSI” means the federal Supplemental Security Income program established under Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act.
(B) “MNL” means the income standard of the Medi-Cal medically needy program defined in Section 14005.12.
(C) Board and care “personal care services” or “PCS” deduction means the income disregard that is applied to a resident in a licensed community care facility, in lieu of the board and care deduction specified in subdivision
(e) of Section 14005.7,

(2) (A) For purposes of this section, the SSI recipient retention amount is the amount by which the SSI maximum payment amount to an individual residing in a licensed community care facility exceeds the maximum amount that the state allows community care facilities to charge a resident who is an SSI recipient.
(B) For purposes of this section, the personal and incidental needs deduction for an individual residing in a licensed community care facility is either of the following:
(i) If the deduction specified in subdivision (e) is applicable to the individual, the amount, not to exceed the amount by which the SSI recipient retention amount exceeds

The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Under existing law, certain aged, blind, and disabled Medi-Cal recipients are required to pay a share of cost as a condition of eligibility, with the share of cost determined in accordance with specified requirements. For purposes of determining the share of cost, existing law establishes a formula to calculate the personal and incidental needs deduction for an individual residing in a licensed community care facility. Existing law prohibits that deduction from exceeding the amount by which the Supplemental Security Income recipient retention amount, as defined, exceeds $20.
This bill would revise the formula to determine the personal and incidental needs deduction. By increasing the responsibility of the counties in determining Medi-Cal eligibility, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require that its provisions be implemented only to the extent that federal financial participation is available and that the department receives any necessary federal approvals.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

SECTION 1.
Section 25503.36 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:
25503.36.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, an authorized licensee may sponsor events promoted by, and may purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, a live entertainment marketing company in connection with events organized and conducted by the live entertainment marketing company on the premises of a permanent retail licensee located at the San Diego County Fairgrounds, located in the City of Del Mar in the County of San Diego, subject to all of the following conditions:
(1) The live entertainment marketing company operates and promotes live artistic, musical, sports, or cultural entertainment events only.
(2)  The events will take place over a period of no more than four consecutive days during which approximately 100 acts will perform before approximately 20,000 or more patrons.
(3) The live entertainment marketing company is a Delaware limited liability company that is under common ownership, management, or control by a private equity firm that may also have common ownership, management, or control of a licensed California winery, provided the winery represents not more than 25 percent of the assets under common ownership, management, or control by the private equity firm or its subsidiaries, and the live entertainment marketing company exercises no control over the operations of the winery. Any authorized licensee sponsoring an event or purchasing advertising space or time, pursuant to this section, shall obtain written verification of compliance with this subdivision prior to such sponsorship or the purchase of advertising space or time.
(4) Any on-sale licensee operating at the San Diego County Fairgrounds shall serve other brands of beer, distilled spirits, and wine distributed by a competing wholesaler or manufacturer in addition to any brand manufactured, distributed, or owned by the authorized licensee sponsoring an event or purchasing advertising space or time pursuant to this section.
(5) An agreement pursuant to this section shall not be conditioned directly or indirectly on the purchase, sale, or distribution of any alcoholic beverage manufactured or distributed by any authorized licensee sponsoring or purchasing advertising space or time pursuant to this section.
(b) Any sponsorship of events or purchase of advertising space or time conducted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be conducted pursuant to a written contract entered into by the authorized licensee and the live entertainment marketing company.
(c) Any authorized licensee who, through coercion or other illegal means, induces, directly or indirectly, a holder of a wholesaler’s license to fulfill those contractual obligations entered into pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine in an amount equal to the entire value of the advertising space or time involved in the contract, whichever is greater, plus ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both imprisonment and fine. The person shall also be subject to license suspension or revocation pursuant to Section 24200.
(d) Any on-sale retail licensee who, directly or indirectly, solicits or coerces a holder of a wholesaler’s license to solicit an authorized licensee to purchase advertising time or space pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine in an amount equal to the entire value of the advertising space or time involved in the contract, whichever is greater, plus ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both imprisonment and fine.

(2) Except for a licensee that holds only a beer and wine importer general license or a distilled spirits importer general license, “importer” does not include the holder of any importer license that does not also hold at least one other license specified as an authorized licensee.
(h) The Legislature finds that it is necessary and proper to require a separation between manufacturing interests, wholesale interests, and retail interests in the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in order to prevent suppliers from dominating local markets through vertical integration and to prevent excessive sales of alcoholic beverages produced by overly aggressive marketing techniques. The Legislature further finds that the exception established by this section to the general prohibition against tied interests must be limited to its expressed terms so as not to undermine the general prohibition, and intends that this section be construed accordingly.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Scaling up the Market Match program throughout the state would be beneficial to the health of local economies and the state economy while simultaneously improving the health of the most vulnerable families throughout California.
(b) Since its inception in 2009, the Market Match program has encouraged the purchase and consumption of California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables by directly linking California specialty crop producers with nutrition benefit clients and doubling the purchasing value of the nutrition assistance received by nutrition benefit clients when purchasing California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables.
(c) Market Match dollars provide incentives for new consumers to visit local farmers’ markets and purchase healthy produce, benefiting both their health and the health of local economies.
(d) The Market Match program has acted as an economic stimulus to local agricultural economies throughout the state by increasing the number of loyal customers and their purchasing power, including in food deserts where California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables are scarce.
(e) Data shows that between 2009 and 2012, the Market Match program increased CalFresh redemption amongst 37,000 new farmers’ market customers at 140 participating farmers’ markets in over 16 counties, from 132 percent to 700 percent.
(f) Data shows that Market Match dollars have had a six-fold return on investment in farmers’ market sales.
(g) The Pacific Coast Farmers’ Market Association’s business analysis of returns on investment (ROI) for Market Match programs in 2012 held in various areas and cities shows the following rates of ROI throughout the state:
(1) East Bay and San Francisco: 132 percent ROI.
(2) Long Beach: 257 percent ROI.
(3) Huntington Park: 403 percent ROI.
(4) Davis: 390 percent ROI.
(5) Woodland: 576 percent ROI.
(6) Monterey: 717 percent ROI.
(h) The enactment of the 2014 federal Farm Bill includes $100 million in grants to states for programs that supplement nutrition benefits if they incentivize healthier eating by beneficiaries.
(i) The first round of grants awarded in 2015 proves that a statewide framework is an effective way to draw down these federal funds. The State of Washington was the largest first-round grant recipient, awarded almost $6 million to help low-income families afford fresh produce. California must act now and tap into this federal funding before it is too late.
(j) Creation of a statewide Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program modeled after the successful experience of the Market Match program would help draw down federal funds to further maximize access to fresh healthy foods and stimulate local economies in a more equitable cross-section of communities.

SECTION 1.
Section 38501 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
38501.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the environment of California. The potential adverse impacts of global warming include the exacerbation of air quality problems, a reduction in the quality and supply of water to the state from the Sierra snowpack, a rise in sea levels resulting in the displacement of thousands of coastal businesses and residences, damage to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, and an increase in the incidences of infectious diseases, asthma, and other human health-related problems.
(b) Global warming will have detrimental effects on some of California’s largest industries, including agriculture, wine, tourism, skiing, recreational and commercial fishing, and forestry. It will also increase the strain on electricity supplies necessary to meet the demand for summer air-conditioning in the hottest parts of the state.
(c) California has long been a national and international leader on energy conservation and environmental stewardship efforts, including the areas of air quality protections, energy efficiency requirements, renewable energy standards, natural resource conservation, and greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger vehicles. The program established by this division will continue this tradition of environmental leadership by placing California at the forefront of national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
(d) National and international actions are necessary to fully address the issue of global warming. However, action taken by California to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will have far-reaching effects by encouraging other states, the federal government, and other countries to act.
(e) By exercising a global leadership role, California will also position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and businesses to benefit from national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. More importantly, investing in the development of innovative and pioneering technologies will assist California in achieving the statewide limits on emissions of greenhouse gases established by this division for 2020 and beyond and will provide an opportunity for the state to take a global economic and technological leadership role in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board coordinate with state agencies,
as well as
and
consult with the environmental justice community, industry sectors, business groups, academic institutions, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders, in implementing this division.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board consult with the Public Utilities Commission in the development of emissions reduction measures, including limits on emissions of greenhouse gases applied to electricity and natural gas providers regulated by the Public Utilities Commission in order to ensure that electricity and natural gas providers are not required to meet duplicative or inconsistent regulatory requirements.
(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board design emissions reduction measures to meet the statewide emissions limits for greenhouse gases established pursuant to this division in a manner that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits for California’s economy, improves and modernizes California’s energy infrastructure and maintains electric system reliability, maximizes additional environmental and economic co-benefits for California, and complements the state’s efforts to improve air quality.
(i) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Climate Action Team established by the Governor to coordinate the efforts set forth under Executive Order S-3-05 continue its role in coordinating overall climate policy.

For the purposes of this division, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Allowance” means an authorization to emit, during a specified year, up to one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.
(b) “Alternative compliance mechanism” means an action undertaken by a greenhouse gas emission source that achieves the equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the same time period as a direct emission reduction, and that is approved by the state board. “Alternative compliance mechanism” includes, but is not limited to, a flexible compliance schedule, alternative control technology, a process change, or a product substitution.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is a small fish native to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Delta smelt is a particularly vulnerable species in the Delta, with a typical lifespan of a single year. It has an unusually low fecundity for a fish with a limited planktonic larvae diet. It resides primarily within the interface between the salt and fresh water.
(b) In 1993, the Delta smelt was listed as threatened and has henceforth been protected under state law pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act.
(c) There are many known threats to the smelt in the Delta. Loss of habitat, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants have all been identified as playing a potential role in the decline of Delta smelt.
(d) It is critical to move forward with the appropriate comprehensive strategy for a sustainable Delta that includes the investments necessary to allow the Delta smelt and other sensitive species to survive and thrive in their native habitat. This goal must be accomplished in a manner that will also provide sufficient and reliable water supplies to meet the public health and safety needs of Californians throughout the state and support California’s vital economic interests.
(e) A long-term comprehensive solution is vital to addressing the myriad of issues affecting ecosystem health and species recovery. However, immediate action is needed to address the critical condition of the Delta smelt population. A Delta smelt hatchery is a single element in what should constitute a suit of actions aimed at improving habitat conditions and species recovery. A Delta smelt hatchery can provide near-term benefits to ensure the survival of this key Delta species.

792,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 739.1 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
739.1.
(a) The commission shall continue a program of assistance to low-income electric and gas customers with annual household incomes that are no greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty guideline levels, the cost of which shall not be borne solely by any single class of customer. For one-person households, program eligibility shall be based on two-person household guideline levels. The program shall be referred to as the California Alternate Rates for Energy or CARE program. The commission shall ensure that the level of discount for low-income electric and gas customers correctly reflects the level of need.
(b) The commission shall establish rates for CARE program participants, subject to both of the following:
(1) That the commission ensure that low-income ratepayers are not jeopardized or overburdened by monthly energy expenditures, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 382.
(2) That the level of the discount for low-income electricity and gas ratepayers correctly reflects the level of need as determined by the needs assessment conducted pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 382.
(c) In establishing CARE discounts for an electrical corporation with 100,000 or more customer accounts in California, the commission shall ensure all of the following:
(1) The average effective CARE discount shall not be less than 30 percent or more than 35 percent of the revenues that would have been produced for the same billed usage by non-CARE customers. The average effective discount determined by the commission shall reflect any charges not paid by CARE customers, including payments for the California Solar Initiative, payments for the self-generation incentive program made pursuant to Section 379.6, payment of the separate rate component to fund the CARE program made pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 381, payments made to the Department of Water Resources pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code, and any discount in a fixed charge. The average effective CARE discount shall be calculated as a weighted average of the CARE discounts provided to individual customers.
(2) If an electrical corporation provides an average effective CARE discount in excess of the maximum percentage specified in paragraph (1), the electrical corporation shall not reduce, on an annual basis, the average effective CARE discount by more than a reasonable percentage decrease below the discount in effect on January 1, 2013, or that the electrical corporation had been authorized to place in effect by that date.
(3) The entire discount shall be provided in the form of a reduction in the overall bill for the eligible CARE customer.
(d) The commission shall work with electrical and gas corporations to establish penetration goals. The commission shall authorize recovery of all administrative costs associated with the implementation of the CARE program that the commission determines to be reasonable, through a balancing account mechanism. Administrative costs shall include, but are not limited to, outreach, marketing, regulatory compliance, certification and verification, billing, measurement and evaluation, and capital improvements and upgrades to communications and processing equipment.
(e) The commission shall examine methods to improve CARE enrollment and participation. This examination shall include, but need not be limited to, comparing information from CARE and the Universal Lifeline Telephone Service (ULTS) to determine the most effective means of utilizing that information to increase CARE enrollment, automatic enrollment of ULTS customers who are eligible for the CARE program, customer privacy issues, and alternative mechanisms for outreach to potential enrollees. The commission shall ensure that a customer consents
prior to
before
enrollment. The commission shall consult with interested parties, including ULTS providers, to develop the best methods of informing ULTS customers about other available low-income programs, as well as the best mechanism for telephone providers to recover reasonable costs incurred pursuant to this section.
(f) (1) The commission shall improve the CARE application process by cooperating with other entities and representatives of California government, including the California Health and Human Services Agency and the Secretary of California Health and Human Services, to ensure that all gas and electric customers eligible for public assistance programs in California that reside within the service territory of an electrical corporation or gas corporation, are enrolled in the CARE program. The commission may determine that gas and electric customers are categorically eligible for CARE assistance if they are enrolled in other public assistance programs with substantially the same income eligibility requirements as the CARE program. To the extent practicable, the commission shall develop a CARE application process using the existing ULTS application process as a model. The commission shall work with electrical and gas corporations and the Low-Income Oversight Board established in Section 382.1 to meet the low-income objectives in this section.
CARE program participants who fail to respond to an income verification request shall be permanently barred from self-certified re
enrollment in the CARE program.
(2) The commission shall ensure that an electrical corporation or gas corporation with a commission-approved program to provide discounts based upon economic need in addition to the CARE program, including a Family Electric Rate Assistance program, utilize a single application form, to enable an applicant to alternatively apply for any assistance program for which the applicant may be eligible. It is the intent of the Legislature to allow applicants under one program, that may not be eligible under that program, but that may be eligible under an alternative assistance program based upon economic need, to complete a single application for any commission-approved assistance program offered by the public utility.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission ensure CARE program participants receive affordable electric and gas service that does not impose an unfair economic burden on those participants.
(h) The commission’s program of assistance to low-income electric and gas customers shall, as soon as practicable, include nonprofit group living facilities specified by the commission, if the commission finds that the residents in these facilities substantially meet the commission’s low-income eligibility requirements and there is a feasible process for certifying that the assistance shall be used for the direct benefit, such as improved quality of care or improved food service, of the low-income residents in the facilities. The commission shall authorize utilities to offer discounts to eligible facilities licensed or permitted by appropriate state or local agencies, and to facilities, including women’s shelters, hospices, and homeless shelters, that may not have a license or permit but provide other proof satisfactory to the utility that they are eligible to participate in the program.
(i) (1) In addition to existing assessments of eligibility, an electrical corporation may require proof of income eligibility for those CARE program participants whose electricity usage, in any monthly or other billing period, exceeds 400 percent of baseline usage. The authority of an electrical corporation to require proof of income eligibility is not limited by the means by which the CARE program participant enrolled in the program, including if the participant was automatically enrolled in the CARE program because of participation in a governmental assistance program. If a CARE program participant’s electricity usage exceeds 400 percent of baseline usage, the electrical corporation may require the CARE program participant to participate in the Energy Savings Assistance Program (ESAP), which includes a residential energy assessment, in order to provide the CARE program participant with information and assistance in reducing his or her energy usage. Continued participation in the CARE program may be conditioned upon the CARE program participant agreeing to participate in ESAP within 45 days of notice being given by the electrical corporation pursuant to this paragraph. The electrical corporation may require the CARE program participant to notify the utility of whether the residence is rented, and if so, a means by which to contact the landlord, and the electrical corporation may share any evaluation and recommendation relative to the residential structure that is made as part of an energy assessment, with the landlord of the CARE program participant. Requirements imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be consistent with procedures adopted by the commission.
(2) If a CARE program participant’s electricity usage exceeds 600 percent of baseline usage, the electrical corporation shall require the CARE program participant to participate in ESAP, which includes a residential energy assessment, in order to provide the CARE program participant with information and assistance in reducing his or her energy usage. Continued participation in the CARE program shall be conditioned upon the CARE program participant agreeing to participate in ESAP within 45 days of a notice made by the electrical corporation pursuant to this paragraph. The electrical corporation may require the CARE program participant to notify the utility of whether the residence is rented, and if so, a means by which to contact the landlord, and the electrical corporation may share any evaluation and recommendation relative to the residential structure that is made as part of an energy assessment, with the landlord of the CARE program participant. Following the completion of the energy assessment, if the CARE program participant’s electricity usage continues to exceed 600 percent of baseline usage, the electrical corporation may remove the CARE program participant from the program if the removal is consistent with procedures adopted by the commission. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a CARE program participant with electricity usage exceeding 600 percent of baseline usage from participating in an appeals process with the electrical corporation to determine whether the participant’s usage levels are legitimate.
(3) A CARE program participant in a rental residence shall not be removed from the program in situations where the landlord is nonresponsive when contacted by the electrical corporation or does not provide for ESAP participation.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations and gas corporations, as defined. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires the commission to establish a program of assistance to low-income electric and gas customers with annual household incomes that are no greater than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, referred to as the California Alternate Rates for Energy or CARE program.
This bill would provide that CARE program participants who fail to respond to an income verification request shall be permanently barred from self-certified reenrollment in the CARE program.
Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
Because the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing its requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Existing law requires a local publicly owned electric utility, in procuring energy, to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency and demand response resources that are cost-effective, reliable, and feasible.
This bill would require electric and gas corporations and local publicly owned electric and gas utilities to require recipients of rebates or incentives from their residential or commercial energy efficiency or weatherization programs to install demand response infrastructure on the property for which the rebates or incentives are provided.
Under the Public Utilities Act, electrical corporations are required to file with the Public Utilities Commission a standard tariff for electricity purchased from certain electric generation facilities. The act declares it is the policy of this state and the intent of the Legislature to encourage electrical generation from eligible renewable energy resources.
This bill would specifically include in those eligible renewable energy resources those that can be used to meet peak demand. The bill also would make nonsubstantive changes and would correct erroneous cross-references.","An act to

795,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 35400 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
35400.
(a) A vehicle may not exceed a length of 40 feet.
(b) This section does not apply to any of the following:
(1) A vehicle used in a combination of vehicles when the excess length is caused by auxiliary parts, equipment, or machinery not used as space to carry any part of the load, except that the combination of vehicles shall not exceed the length provided for combination vehicles.
(2) A vehicle, when the excess length is caused by any parts necessary to comply with the fender and mudguard regulations of this code.
(3) (A) An articulated bus or articulated trolley coach that does not exceed a length of 60 feet.
(B) An articulated bus or articulated trolley coach described in subparagraph (A) may be equipped with a folding device attached to the front of the bus or trolley if the device is designed and used exclusively for transporting bicycles. The device, including any bicycles transported thereon, shall be mounted in a manner that does not materially affect efficiency or visibility of vehicle safety equipment, and shall not extend more than 36 inches from the front body of the bus or trolley coach when fully deployed. The handlebars of a bicycle that is transported on a device described in this subparagraph shall not extend more than 42 inches from the front of the bus.
(4) A semitrailer while being towed by a motortruck or truck tractor, if the distance from the kingpin to the rearmost axle of the semitrailer does not exceed 40 feet for semitrailers having two or more axles, or 38 feet for semitrailers having one axle if the semitrailer does not, exclusive of attachments, extend forward of the rear of the cab of the motortruck or truck tractor.
(5) A bus or house car when the excess length is caused by the projection of a front safety bumper or a rear safety bumper, or both. The safety bumper shall not cause the length of the vehicle to exceed the maximum legal limit by more than one foot in the front and one foot in the rear. For the purposes of this chapter, “safety bumper” means any device that is fitted on an existing bumper or which replaces the bumper and is constructed, treated, or manufactured to absorb energy upon impact.
(6) A schoolbus, when the excess length is caused by the projection of a crossing control arm. For the purposes of this chapter, “crossing control arm” means an extendable and retractable device fitted to the front of a schoolbus that is designed to impede movement of pupils exiting the schoolbus directly in front of the schoolbus so that pupils are visible to the driver while they are moving in front of the schoolbus. An operator of a schoolbus shall not extend a crossing control arm while the schoolbus is in motion. Except when activated, a crossing control arm shall not cause the maximum length of the schoolbus to be extended by more than 10 inches, inclusive of any front safety bumper. Use of a crossing control arm by the operator of a schoolbus does not, in and of itself, fulfill his or her responsibility to ensure the safety of students crossing a highway or private road pursuant to Section 22112.
(7) A bus, when the excess length is caused by a device, located in front of the front axle, for lifting wheelchairs into the bus. That device shall not cause the length of the bus to be extended by more than 18 inches, inclusive of any front safety bumper.
(8) A bus, when the excess length is caused by a device attached to the rear of the bus designed and used exclusively for the transporting of bicycles. This device may be up to 10 feet in length, if the device, along with any other device permitted pursuant to this section, does not cause the total length of the bus, including any device or load, to exceed 50 feet.
(9) A bus operated by a public agency or a passenger stage corporation, as defined in Section 226 of the Public Utilities Code, used in transit system service, other than a schoolbus, when the excess length is caused by a folding device attached to the front of the bus which is designed and used exclusively for transporting bicycles. The device, including any bicycles transported thereon, shall be mounted in a manner that does not materially affect efficiency or visibility of vehicle safety equipment, and shall not extend more than 40 inches from the front
body
of the bus when fully deployed. The handlebars of a bicycle that is transported on a device described in this paragraph shall not extend more than 46 inches from the front of the bus. A device described in this paragraph may not be used on a bus that, exclusive of the device, exceeds 40 feet in length or on a bus having a device attached to the rear of the bus pursuant to paragraph (8).
(10) (A) A bus of a length of up to 45 feet when operating on those highways specified in subdivision (a) of Section 35401.5. The Department of Transportation or local authorities, with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions, may not deny reasonable access to a bus of a length of up to 45 feet between the highways specified in subdivision (a) of Section 35401.5 and points of loading and unloading for motor carriers of passengers as required by the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240).
(B) A bus operated by a public agency and on those highways specified in subparagraph (A) may be equipped with a folding device attached to the front of the bus that is designed and used exclusively for transporting bicycles. The device, including all bicycles transported thereon, may be mounted in a manner that does not materially affect efficiency or visibility of vehicle safety equipment, and may not extend more than 36 inches from the front body of the bus when fully deployed. The handlebars of a bicycle that is transported on a device described in this subparagraph may not extend more than 42 inches from the front of the bus. The total length of the bus, including the folding device or load, may not exceed 48.5 feet. A Route Review Committee, established under this subparagraph, shall review the routes where a public agency proposes to operate a 45-foot bus equipped with a front-mounted bicycle rack. The Route Review Committee shall be comprised of one member from the public agency appointed by the general manager of the public agency; one member who is a traffic engineer and is employed and selected by the public agency that has jurisdiction over the largest proportional share of routes among all affected agencies; and one member appointed by the labor organization that is the exclusive representative of the bus drivers of the public agency. If there is no exclusive representative of the bus drivers, a bus driver member shall be chosen by a majority vote of the bus drivers employed by the agency. The members of the Route Review Committee shall be selected not more than 30 days after receipt of a public agency proposal to equip a 45-foot bus with a front-mounted bicycle rack. The review shall include a field review of the proposed routes. The purpose of the Route Review Committee is to ensure the safe operation of a 45-foot bus that is equipped with a front-mounted bicycle rack. The Route Review Committee, by a unanimous vote, shall make a determination of which routes are suitable for the safe operation of a 45-foot bus that is equipped with a front-mounted bicycle rack. These determinations shall be consistent with the operating requirements specified in subparagraph (A). It is the intent of the Legislature that the field review required under this subparagraph include consultation with traffic engineers from affected public agencies that have jurisdiction over segments of the route or routes under review, to ensure coordination with all affected state and local public road agencies that may potentially be impacted due to the operation of a 45-foot bus with a front-mounted bicycle rack.
(11) (A) A house car of a length of up to 45 feet when operating on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways or when using those portions of federal aid primary system highways that have been qualified by the United States Secretary of Transportation for that use, or when using routes appropriately identified by the Department of Transportation or local authorities, with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions.
(B) A house car described in subparagraph (A) may be operated on a highway that provides reasonable access to facilities for purposes limited to fuel, food, and lodging when that access is consistent with the safe operation of the vehicle and when the facility is within one road mile of identified points of ingress and egress to or from highways specified in subparagraph (A) for use by that vehicle.
(C) As used in this paragraph and paragraph (10), “reasonable access” means access substantially similar to that authorized for combinations of vehicles pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 35401.5.
(D) Any access route established by a local authority pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 35401.5 is open for access by a house car of a length of up to 45 feet. In addition, local authorities may establish a process whereby access to services by house cars of a length of up to 45 feet may be applied for upon a route not previously established as an access route. The denial of a request for access to services shall be only on the basis of safety and an engineering analysis of the proposed access route. In lieu of processing an access application, local authorities, with respect to highways under their jurisdiction, may provide signing, mapping, or a listing of highways, as necessary, to indicate the use of these specific routes by a house car of a length of up to 45 feet.
(c) The Legislature, by increasing the maximum permissible kingpin to rearmost axle distance to 40 feet effective January 1, 1987, as provided in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b), does not intend this action to be considered a precedent for any future increases in truck size and length limitations.
(d) Any transit bus equipped with a folding device installed on or after January 1, 1999, that is permitted under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) or under paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) shall be additionally equipped with any of the following:
(1) An indicator light that is visible to the driver and is activated whenever the folding device is in an extended position.
(2) Any other device or mechanism that provides notice to the driver that the folding device is in an extended position.
(3) A mechanism that causes the folding device to retract automatically from an extended position.
(e) (1) A person may not improperly or unsafely mount a bicycle on a device described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), or in paragraph (9) or (10) of subdivision (b).
(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of Section 23114 or subdivision (a) of Section 24002 or any other provision of law, when a bicycle is improperly or unsafely loaded by a passenger onto a transit bus, the passenger, and not the driver, is liable for any violation of this code that is attributable to the improper or unlawful loading of the bicycle.

(1)The governing body of the city shall not sell the water utility property for less than its fair market value determined as set forth in the Public Water System Investment and Consolidation Act of 1997 (Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 2718) of Part 2 of Division 1).
(2)A majority of the members of the governing body of the city must approve the sale.
(3)The entity acquiring the water utility property shall be a public utility, as defined in Section 216, which is presently authorized by the commission to provide water utility service within the corporate limits of the city pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity and the area of the one or more certificates includes or surrounds all or part of the city’s water utility system.
(4)As a condition of acquiring the city’s water system, the acquiring public utility shall file a revised service area map with the commission that shows the area formerly served through the city’s water utility system as part of the acquiring public utility’s service area. The acquiring public utility shall submit the map by filing a tier-one advice letter with the commission and, upon this filing, shall be deemed authorized and bound to render public utility water service to all persons in the area formerly served through the city’s water utility system on the same terms, conditions, and rates that the commission has found to be just and reasonable for the acquiring public utility’s other customers in the city.
(b)This section shall remain in effect only until July 1, 2017, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before July 1, 2017, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances applicable to the City of Montebello. The City Council of the City of Montebello believes it is no longer in the public interest to own and operate all or part of a water utility and desires to sell its water utility. However, the city would be unable to do so in a timely manner because the Legislature has enacted statutes that may conflict with one another and with the City of Montebello’s urgent financial requirements, thereby preventing the City of Montebello from selling and the acquiring public utility from purchasing the water utility without an election and performance of other procedures. In order to clearly state the law with respect to the City of Montebello, a special statute is needed and a general statute cannot be made applicable.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
The City of Montebello’s water utility infrastructure is aging and is experiencing numerous leaks and equipment failures. The aging and failing water utility infrastructure impairs the safety and reliability of the city’s water utility system, including its ability to provide water for public fire-fighting purposes. The city’s water utility serves only a small fraction of the city’s residents and is losing money despite significant recent rate increases. The city’s budget and general fund cannot make up for that revenue shortfall or the cost of the urgently needed water supply infrastructure upgrades and repairs of its water utility system. The City of Montebello desires to sell all or part of the city-owned water utility to a public utility capable of operating, managing, and upgrading the water system while financial conditions are favorable to the city, however, the Legislature has adopted statutes governing the sale of municipal property which may conflict with each other and the urgent needs of the city. In order to provide the City of Montebello with the clear statutory authority to sell its water utility without an election as soon as possible, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law imposes a 40-foot limitation on the length of vehicles that may be operated on the highways, with specified exemptions. Existing law exempts from this limitation a bus, except a schoolbus, operated by a public agency or a passenger stage corporation, as defined, used in transit system service if the bus is equipped with a folding device attached to the front of the bus that is designed and used exclusively for transporting bicycles, the device does not materially affect efficiency or visibility of vehicle safety equipment, and the length of the bus, exclusive of that device, does not exceed 40 feet in length. In addition, existing law prohibits, among other things, the above-described device from extending more than 40 inches from the front body of the bus when fully deployed.
This bill would instead prohibit the above-described device from extending more than 40 inches from the front of the bus.
Existing law provides a procedure that is generally applicable for a city to sell its real property. Existing law also establishes specific procedures for the sale of public utility property owned by a municipal corporation with certain provisions applicable to the sale of property of a water utility.
This bill would authorize the City of Montebello to sell all or part of its water utility pursuant to the procedures that are generally applicable to a sale of real property by a city, if certain requirements are met.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Montebello.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to
add and repeal Section 37420.5 of the Government Code, and to add and repeal Section 10051.5 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to water utilities, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.

(b) If the subject premises have undergone inspection by a CASp and, to the best of the commercial property owner’s or lessor’s knowledge, there have been no modifications or alterations completed or commenced between the date of the inspection and the date of the lease or rental agreement which have impacted the subject premises’ compliance with construction-related accessibility standards, the commercial property owner or lessor shall provide, prior to execution of the lease or rental agreement, a copy of any report prepared by the CASp with an agreement from the prospective lessee or tenant that information in the report shall remain confidential, except as necessary for the tenant to complete repairs and corrections of violations of construction-related accessibility standards that the lessee or tenant agrees to make.
(c) If the subject premises have been issued an inspection report by a CASp, as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.53, indicating that it meets applicable standards, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of 55.52, the commercial property owner or lessor shall provide a copy of the current disability access inspection certificate and any inspection report to the lessee or tenant not already provided pursuant to subdivision (b) within seven days of the date of the execution of the lease form or rental agreement.
(d) If the subject premises have not been issued a disability access inspection certificate, as described in subdivision (e) of Section 55.53, the commercial property owner or lessor shall state the following on the lease form or rental agreement:


“A Certified Access Specialist (CASp) can inspect the subject premises and determine whether the subject premises comply with all of the applicable construction-related accessibility standards under state law. Although state law does not require a CASp inspection of the subject premises, the commercial property owner or lessor may not prohibit the lessee or tenant from obtaining a CASp inspection of the subject premises for the occupancy or potential occupancy of the lessee or tenant, at the lessee’s or tenant’s expense, if requested by the lessee or tenant. The parties shall mutually agree on the arrangements for the time and manner of the CASp inspection.”

Section 4459.8 of the Government Code is amended to read:
4459.8.
(a) The certification authorized by Section 4459.5 is effective for three years from the date of initial certification and expires if not renewed. The State Architect, upon consideration of any factual complaints regarding the work of a certified access specialist or of other relevant information, may suspend certification or deny renewal of certification.
(b) (1) The State Architect shall require each applicant for certification as a certified access specialist to do both of the following:
(A) Pay fees, including an application and course fee and an examination fee, at a level sufficient to meet the costs of application processing, registration, publishing a list, and other activities that are reasonably necessary to implement and administer the certified access specialist program.
(B) Provide to the State Architect the name of the city, county, or city and county in which the applicant intends to provide services.
(2) The State Architect shall require each applicant for renewal of certification to do both of the following:
(A) Pay a fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of reassessing qualifications of renewal applicants.
(B) Provide to the State Architect the name of the city, county, or city and county in which the applicant has provided services since the last day of certification by the State Architect.
(3) The State Architect shall periodically review his or her schedule of fees to ensure that the fees for certification are not excessive while covering the costs to administer the certified access specialist program. The application fee for a California licensed architect, landscape architect, civil engineer, or structural engineer shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250).
(c) All fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the Certified Access Specialist Fund, which is hereby created in the State Treasury. Notwithstanding Section 13340, this fund is continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years for use by the State Architect to implement Sections 4459.5 to 4459.8, inclusive.
(d) The State Architect shall post on his or her Internet Web site the name of the city, county, or city and county in which each certified access specialist provides or intends to provide services.

Section 8299.06 of the Government Code is amended to read:
8299.06.
(a) A priority of the commission shall be the development and dissemination of educational materials and information to promote and facilitate disability access compliance.
(b) The commission shall work with other state agencies, including the Division of the State Architect and the Department of Rehabilitation, to develop educational materials and information for use by businesses to understand their obligations to provide disability access and to facilitate compliance with construction-related accessibility standards.
(c) The commission shall develop and make available on its Internet Web site, or make available on its Internet Web site if developed by another governmental agency, including Americans with Disabilities Act centers, toolkits or educational modules to assist a California business to understand its obligations under the law and to facilitate compliance with respect to the top 10 alleged construction-related violations, by type, as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 8299.08. Upon completion of this requirement, the commission shall develop and make available on its Internet Web site, or work with another agency to develop, other toolkits or educational modules that would educate businesses of the accessibility requirements and to facilitate compliance with that requirement.
(d) The commission shall post the following on its Internet Web site:
(1) Educational materials and information that will assist building owners, tenants, building officials, and building inspectors to understand the disability accessibility requirements and to facilitate compliance with disability access laws. The commission shall at least annually review the educational materials and information on disability access requirements and compliance available on the Internet Web sites of other local, state, or federal agencies, including Americans with Disabilities Act centers, to augment the educational materials and information developed by the commission.
(2) A link to the Internet Web site of the Division of the State Architect’s Certified Access Specialist (CASp) Program to assist building owners and tenants in locating or hiring a CASp.
(e) The commission shall, to the extent feasible, coordinate with other state agencies and local building departments to ensure that information provided to the public on disability access requirements is uniform and complete, and make its educational materials and information available to those agencies and departments.
(f) The commission shall establish a permanent legislative outreach coordinator position and a permanent educational outreach coordinator position.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires the State Architect to establish and publicize a program for the voluntary certification by the state of any person who meets specified criteria as a Certified Access Specialist (CASp). Existing law requires each applicant for CASp certification or renewal to pay certain fees, and requires the State Architect to periodically review those fees, as specified. Existing law provides for the deposit of those fees into the Certified Access Specialist Fund, which is continuously appropriated for use by the State Architect to implement the CASp program.
This bill would require applicants for CASp certification or renewal to additionally provide to the State Architect the name of the city, county, or city and county in which the applicant intends to provide or has provided services, and would require the State Architect to post that information on his or her Internet Web site.
(2) Existing law requires a commercial property owner or lessor to state on every lease form or rental agreement executed on or after July 1, 2013, whether the property has been determined by a CASp to meet all applicable construction-related accessibility standards.
This bill, for every lease form or rental agreement executed on or after January 1, 2016, would require the commercial property owner or lessor to provide the lessee or tenant with a current disability access inspection certificate and inspection report or a copy of a CASp inspection report, as specified, or would require a statement on the form or agreement that, upon request of the lessee or tenant, the property owner may not prohibit a CASp inspection of the subject premises at the lessee’s or tenant’s expense and that the parties must mutually agree on the arrangements for the time and manner of the inspection.
(3) Existing law establishes the California Commission on Disability Access for purposes of developing recommendations to enable persons with disabilities to exercise their right to full and equal access to public facilities and facilitating business compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Existing law sets forth the powers and duties of the commission, including, but not limited to, developing educational materials and information for businesses, building owners, tenants, and building officials, posting that information on the commission’s Internet Web site, and coordinating with other state agencies and local building departments to ensure that information provided to the public on disability access requirements is uniform and complete. Existing law provides that those provisions shall not remain operative unless funds are appropriated for those purposes.
This bill would additionally require the commission to provide a link on its Internet Web site to the Internet Web site of the Division of the State Architect’s CASp certification program and to make the commission’s educational materials and information available to other state agencies and local building departments.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1938 of the Civil Code, and to amend Sections 4459.8 and 8299.06 of the Government Code, relating to disability access."

Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to provide affirmative and competent advice to noncitizen defendants regarding the potential immigration consequences of their criminal cases. California courts also have held that defense counsel must investigate and advise regarding the immigration consequences of the available dispositions, and should, when consistent with the goals of and informed consent of the defendant, and as consistent with professional standards, defend against adverse immigration consequences (People v. Soriano, 194 Cal.App.3d 1470 (1987), People v. Barocio, 216 Cal.App.3d 99 (1989), People v. Bautista, 115 Cal.App.4th 229 (2004)).
(b) In Padilla v. Kentucky, the United States Supreme Court sanctioned the consideration of immigration consequences by both parties in the plea negotiating process. The court stated that “informed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.”
(c) In Padilla v. Kentucky, the United States Supreme Court found that for noncitizens, deportation is an integral part of the penalty imposed for criminal convictions. Deportation may result from serious offenses or a single minor offense. It may be by far the most serious penalty flowing from the conviction.
(d) With an accurate understanding of immigration consequences, many noncitizen defendants are able to plead to a conviction and sentence that satisfy the prosecution and court, but that have no, or fewer, adverse immigration consequences than the original charge.
(e) Defendants who are misadvised or not advised at all of the immigration consequences of criminal charges often suffer irreparable damage to their current or potential lawful immigration status, resulting in penalties such as mandatory detention, deportation, and permanent separation from close family. In some cases, these consequences could have been avoided had counsel provided informed advice and attempted to defend against such consequences.
(f) Once in removal proceedings, a noncitizen may be transferred to any of over 200 immigration detention facilities across the country. Many criminal offenses trigger mandatory detention, so that the person may not request bond. In immigration proceedings, there is no court-appointed right to counsel and as a result, the majority of detained immigrants go unrepresented. Immigration judges often lack the power to consider whether the person should remain in the United States in light of equitable factors such as serious hardship to United States citizen family members, length of time living in the United States, or rehabilitation.
(g) The immigration consequences of criminal convictions have a particularly strong impact in California. One out of every four persons living in the state is foreign-born. One out of every two children lives in a household headed by at least one foreign-born person. The majority of these children are United States citizens. It is estimated that 50,000 parents of California United States citizen children were deported in a little over two years. Once a person is deported, especially after a criminal conviction, it is extremely unlikely that he or she ever is permitted to return.
(h) It is the intent of the Legislature to codify Padilla v. Kentucky and related California case law and to encourage the growth of such case law in furtherance of justice and the findings and declarations of this section.
SEC. 2.
Section 1016.3 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
1016.3.
(a) Defense counsel shall provide accurate and affirmative advice about the immigration consequences of a proposed disposition, and when consistent with the goals of and with the informed consent of the defendant, and consistent with professional standards, defend against those consequences.
(b) The prosecution, in the interests of justice, and in furtherance of the findings and declarations of Section 1016.2, shall consider the avoidance of adverse immigration consequences in the plea negotiation process as one factor in an effort to reach a just resolution.
(c) This code section shall not be interpreted to change the requirements of Section 1016.5, including the requirement that no defendant shall be required to disclose his or her immigration status to the court.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the court in a noncapital case, if the defendant appears for arraignment without counsel, to inform the defendant that it is his or her right to have counsel before being arraigned and to ask the defendant if he or she desires the assistance of counsel. If the defendant desires and is unable to employ counsel, the court is required to assign counsel to defend him or her as provided. Existing law requires courts, prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by a defendant, to inform the defendant that a conviction of the offense charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.
This bill would require defense counsel to provide accurate and affirmative advice about the immigration consequences of a proposed disposition, and when consistent with the goals of and with the informed consent of the defendant, and with professional standards, defend against those consequences. The bill would require the prosecution, in the interests of justice, to consider the avoidance of adverse immigration consequences in the plea negotiation process as one factor in an effort to reach a just resolution. By requiring an increased level of service, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Sections 1016.2 and 1016.3 to the Penal Code, relating to criminal procedure."

799,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) For millennia, fire has shaped and renewed the ecosystems of California’s forestlands. Some of these fires were naturally ignited by lightning, but fire was also an important tool for Native Americans.
(b) For more than a century, states and the federal government have focused on fire suppression. This has resulted in unnaturally high fuel accumulations. Forests that may have normally hosted 50 to 60 trees per acre can now average 350 trees per acre or more. These forest conditions, often combined with prolonged periods of drought, substantially increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire and complicate response efforts.
(c) Historically, fire regimes were frequent, as often as every 3 to 10 years, but burned with far less intensity. Unlike modern catastrophic wildfires, historic forest fires largely burned surface fuels and scattered small groups of trees. In contrast, today’s forest fires often devastate wide swaths of forest, threaten and damage buildings and life, destroy habitat, kill wildlife, and cause severe erosion.
(d) California is expected to see more large fires in the future, which will result in increased greenhouse gas emissions. Some studies suggest that forest-fire-related greenhouse gas emissions could increase by more than 50 percent in the next 70 years.
(e) The 2013 Rim Fire burned over 250,000 acres over 69 days and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and environmental damage; destroyed significant habitat for a number of California’s rarest animals; and demanded more than $125 million in firefighting costs. It is estimated that the Rim Fire released over 11 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 2.3 million cars. Experts have attributed the fire’s exponential growth to a century’s worth of fuel left behind due to historical fire suppression policies.
(f) The 2007 Angora Fire resulted in roughly 143,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, or approximately 46.2 tons per acre. Studies indicate that those emissions could have been lowered to 12 tons per acre if the tree density was reduced from approximately 273 trees per acre to the natural 60 trees per acre level.
(g) To avoid these greenhouse gas emissions, we must focus our efforts on reducing the risk and intensity of catastrophic wildfires.
SEC. 2.
Section 38552 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
38552.
(a) No later than January 1, 2017, the state board, in consultation with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, shall estimate the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires in California between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive. To ensure the most accurate determination feasible, the state board shall evaluate the best available information on greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires.
(b) No later than January 1, 2017, the state board shall develop an emissions baseline for wildfires by calculating the average of the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive.
(c) No later than July 1, 2017, and every year thereafter, the state board and the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection shall annually approximate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires during the prior calendar year.
(d) In performing the requirements pursuant to this section, the state board and the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection shall consider and separately quantify emissions associated with fires originating on federally managed lands and evaluate whether those emissions were exacerbated by management activities utilized on those lands.

Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
39719.
(a) The Legislature shall appropriate the annual proceeds of the fund for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this state in accordance with the requirements of Section 39712.
(b) To carry out a portion of the requirements of subdivision (a), annual proceeds are continuously appropriated for the following:
(1) Beginning in the 2015–16 fiscal year, and notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, 35 percent of annual proceeds are continuously appropriated, without regard to fiscal years, for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs as following:
(A) Ten percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Transportation Agency for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program created by Part 2 (commencing with Section 75220) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code.
(B) Five percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program created by Part 3 (commencing with Section 75230) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code.
Funds
Moneys
shall be allocated by the Controller, according to requirements of the program, and pursuant to the distribution formula in subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 99312 of, and Sections 99313 and 99314 of, the Public Utilities Code.
(C) Twenty percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program created by Part 1 (commencing with Section 75200) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code. Of the amount appropriated in this subparagraph, no less than 10 percent of the annual
proceeds,
proceeds
shall be expended for affordable housing, consistent with the provisions of that program.
(2) Beginning in the 2015–16 fiscal year, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, 25 percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for the following components of the initial operating segment and Phase I Blended System as described in the 2012 business plan adopted pursuant to Section 185033 of the Public Utilities Code:
(A) Acquisition and construction costs of the project.
(B) Environmental review and design costs of the project.
(C) Other capital costs of the project.
(D) Repayment of any loans made to the authority to fund the project.
(3) Beginning with the 2016–17 fiscal year and notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) is hereby continuously appropriated to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection from the fund, for the purposes of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by preventing the incidence and reducing the intensity of catastrophic wildfires, by any of the following methods:
(A) Vegetation management and brush clearance.
(B) Biomass energy incentives.
(C) Incentives for private actions to reduce the risk or intensity of wildfires or improve the resiliency of those lands.
(D) Reforestation of lands that have previously been burned in a catastrophic wildfire.
(c) In determining the amount of annual proceeds of the fund for purposes of the calculation in subdivision (b), the
funds
moneys
subject to Section 39719.1 shall not be included.

4495.
(a) No later than July 1, 2017, the department shall, after one or more public workshops, with public notice, and an opportunity for all interested parties to comment, develop and begin implementation of strategies to reduce by 2035 the preceding five-year average of greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires by 20 percent below the greenhouse gas emissions baseline established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 38552 of the Health and Safety Code.
(b) The strategies developed and implemented pursuant to subdivision (a) may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
(1) Vegetation management and brush clearance.
(2) Biomass energy incentives.
(3) Incentives for private actions to reduce the risk or intensity of wildfires or improve the resiliency of those lands.
(4) Reforestation of lands that have previously been burned in a catastrophic wildfire.
(5) Agreements between the federal government and the department to undertake identified strategies.","Existing law requires the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to implement various fire prevention programs in the state and to provide fire suppression service in the event of wildfires in forest resources and timberlands.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be available upon appropriation.
This bill would require the state board, in consultation with the department, no later than January 1, 2017, to estimate the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires in California between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive. The bill would require the state board to develop, no later than January 1, 2017, an emissions baseline for wildfires by calculating the average of the annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with wildfires between the years 1990 and 2015, inclusive.
