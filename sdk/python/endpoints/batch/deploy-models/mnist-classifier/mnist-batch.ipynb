    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - In this example, we're going to deploy a model to solve the classic MNIST (\"Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology\") digit recognition problem to perform batch inferencing over large amounts of data (image files). In the first section of this tutorial, we're going to create a batch deployment with a model created using Torch. Such deployment will become our default one in the endpoint. In the second half, we're going to see how we can create a second deployment using a model created with TensorFlow (Keras), test it out, and then switch the endpoint to start using the new deployment as default once we confirm it is working..
