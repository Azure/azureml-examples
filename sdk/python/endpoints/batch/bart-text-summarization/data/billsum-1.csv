SECTION 1.
Section 10295.35 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:
10295.35.
(a) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, a state agency shall not enter into any contract for the acquisition of goods or services in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more with a contractor that, in the provision of benefits, discriminates between employees on the basis of an employee’s or dependent’s actual or perceived gender identity, including, but not limited to, the employee’s or dependent’s identification as transgender.
(2) For purposes of this section, “contract” includes contracts with a cumulative amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more per contractor in each fiscal year.
(3) For purposes of this section, an employee health plan is discriminatory if the plan is not consistent with Section 1365.5 of the Health and Safety Code and Section 10140 of the Insurance Code.
(4) The requirements of this section shall apply only to those portions of a contractor’s operations that occur under any of the following conditions:
(A) Within the state.
(B) On real property outside the state if the property is owned by the state or if the state has a right to occupy the property, and if the contractor’s presence at that location is connected to a contract with the state.
(C) Elsewhere in the United States where work related to a state contract is being performed.
(b) Contractors shall treat as confidential, to the maximum extent allowed by law or by the requirement of the contractor’s insurance provider, any request by an employee or applicant for employment benefits or any documentation of eligibility for benefits submitted by an employee or applicant for employment.
(c) After taking all reasonable measures to find a contractor that complies with this section, as determined by the state agency, the requirements of this section may be waived under any of the following circumstances:
(1) There is only one prospective contractor willing to enter into a specific contract with the state agency.
(2) The contract is necessary to respond to an emergency, as determined by the state agency, that endangers the public health, welfare, or safety, or the contract is necessary for the provision of essential services, and no entity that complies with the requirements of this section capable of responding to the emergency is immediately available.
(3) The requirements of this section violate, or are inconsistent with, the terms or conditions of a grant, subvention, or agreement, if the agency has made a good faith attempt to change the terms or conditions of any grant, subvention, or agreement to authorize application of this section.
(4) The contractor is providing wholesale or bulk water, power, or natural gas, the conveyance or transmission of the same, or ancillary services, as required for ensuring reliable services in accordance with good utility practice, if the purchase of the same cannot practically be accomplished through the standard competitive bidding procedures and the contractor is not providing direct retail services to end users.
(d) (1) A contractor shall not be deemed to discriminate in the provision of benefits if the contractor, in providing the benefits, pays the actual costs incurred in obtaining the benefit.
(2) If a contractor is unable to provide a certain benefit, despite taking reasonable measures to do so, the contractor shall not be deemed to discriminate in the provision of benefits.
(e) (1) Every contract subject to this chapter shall contain a statement by which the contractor certifies that the contractor is in compliance with this section.
(2) The department or other contracting agency shall enforce this section pursuant to its existing enforcement powers.
(3) (A) If a contractor falsely certifies that it is in compliance with this section, the contract with that contractor shall be subject to Article 9 (commencing with Section 10420), unless, within a time period specified by the department or other contracting agency, the contractor provides to the department or agency proof that it has complied, or is in the process of complying, with this section.
(B) The application of the remedies or penalties contained in Article 9 (commencing with Section 10420) to a contract subject to this chapter shall not preclude the application of any existing remedies otherwise available to the department or other contracting agency under its existing enforcement powers.
(f) Nothing in this section is intended to regulate the contracting practices of any local jurisdiction.
(g) This section shall be construed so as not to conflict with applicable federal laws, rules, or regulations. In the event that a court or agency of competent jurisdiction holds that federal law, rule, or regulation invalidates any clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this code or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, it is the intent of the state that the court or agency sever that clause, sentence, paragraph, or section so that the remainder of this section shall remain in effect.
SEC. 2.
Section 10295.35 of the Public Contract Code shall not be construed to create any new enforcement authority or responsibility in the Department of General Services or any other contracting agency.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law authorizes state agencies to enter into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services upon approval by the Department of General Services. Existing law sets forth various requirements and prohibitions for those contracts, including, but not limited to, a prohibition on entering into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services of $100,000 or more with a contractor that discriminates between spouses and domestic partners or same-sex and different-sex couples in the provision of benefits. Existing law provides that a contract entered into in violation of those requirements and prohibitions is void and authorizes the state or any person acting on behalf of the state to bring a civil action seeking a determination that a contract is in violation and therefore void. Under existing law, a willful violation of those requirements and prohibitions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would also prohibit a state agency from entering into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services of $100,000 or more with a contractor that discriminates between employees on the basis of gender identity in the provision of benefits, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 10295.35 to the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts."

SECTION 1.
Section 1091 of the Government Code is amended to read:
1091.
(a) An officer shall not be deemed to be interested in a contract entered into by a body or board of which the officer is a member within the meaning of this article if the officer has only a remote interest in the contract and if the fact of that interest is disclosed to the body or board of which the officer is a member and noted in its official records, and thereafter the body or board authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract in good faith by a vote of its membership sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of the officer or member with the remote interest.

For purposes of this paragraph, time of employment with the contracting party by the officer shall be counted in computing the three-year period specified in this paragraph even though the contracting party has been converted from one form of business organization to a different form of business organization within three years of the initial taking of office by the officer. Time of employment in that case shall be counted only if, after the transfer or change in organization, the real or ultimate ownership of the contracting party is the same or substantially similar to that which existed before the transfer or change in organization. For purposes of this paragraph, stockholders, bondholders, partners, or other persons holding an interest in the contracting party are regarded as having the “real or ultimate ownership” of the contracting party.

(7) That of a member of a nonprofit corporation formed under the Food and Agricultural Code or a nonprofit corporation formed under the Corporations Code for the sole purpose of engaging in the merchandising of agricultural products or the supplying of water.

(11) That of an engineer, geologist, architect, or planner employed by a consulting engineering, architectural, or planning firm. This paragraph applies only to an employee of a consulting firm who does not serve in a primary management capacity, and does not apply to an officer or director of a consulting firm.
(12) That of an elected officer otherwise subject to Section 1090, in any housing assistance payment contract entered into pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.

This section applies to any person who became a public official on or after November 1, 1986.
(13) That of a person receiving salary, per diem, or reimbursement for expenses from a government entity.
(14) That of a person owning less than 3 percent of the shares of a contracting party that is a for-profit corporation, provided that the ownership of the shares derived from the person’s employment with that corporation.
(15) That of a party to litigation involving the body or board of which the officer is a member in connection with an agreement in which all of the following apply:
(A) The agreement is entered into as part of a settlement of litigation in which the body or board is represented by legal counsel.

(c) This section is not applicable to any officer interested in a contract who influences or attempts to influence another member of the body or board of which he or she is a member to enter into the contract.
(d) The willful failure of an officer to disclose the fact of his or her interest in a contract pursuant to this section is punishable as provided in Section 1097. That violation does not void the contract unless the contracting party had knowledge of the fact of the remote interest of the officer at the time the contract was executed.","Existing law prohibits Members of the Legislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members. Existing law identifies certain remote interests in contracts that are not subject to this prohibition and other situations in which an official is not deemed to be financially interested in a contract. Existing law makes a willful violation of this prohibition a crime.
This bill would include in the definition of “remote interest” the interest of a person who is an owner or partner of a firm serving as an appointed member of an unelected board or commission of the contracting agency, if the owner or partner recuses himself or herself from providing any advice to the contracting agency regarding the contract between the firm and the contracting agency, and from all participation in reviewing a project that results from that contract. The bill would also include in the definition of “remote interest” the interest of a planner employed by a consulting engineering, architectural, or planning firm.","An act to amend Section 1091 of the Government Code, relating to public officers and employees."

SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless with the written permission of certain school district officials. Existing law defines a school zone as an area on the grounds of a school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or within a distance of 1,000 feet of that school. Existing law prohibits a person from bringing or possessing a firearm upon the grounds of a campus of a public or private university or college, or buildings owned or operated for student housing, teaching, research, or administration by a public or private university or college, that are contiguous or are clearly marked university property, as specified, unless with the written permission of specified university or college officials. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a felony, or, under specified circumstances, a misdemeanor. Under existing law, certain persons are exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions, including, among others, a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm and a retired peace officer authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm.
This bill would recast the provisions relating to a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm to allow that person to carry a firearm in an area that is within 1,000 feet of, but not on the grounds of, a public or private school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive. The bill would also delete the exemption that allows a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm to bring or possess a firearm on the campus of a university or college. The bill would create an additional exemption from those prohibitions for certain appointed peace officers who are authorized to carry a firearm by their appointing agency, and an exemption for certain retired reserve peace officers who are authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits carrying ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, the superintendent’s designee, or equivalent school authority.
This bill would reorganize those exceptions. The bill would delete the exemption that allows a person to carry ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds if the person is licensed to carry a concealed firearm. The bill would also create an additional exception to that prohibition by authorizing a person to carry ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds if it is in a motor vehicle at all times and is within a locked container or within the locked trunk of the vehicle.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 626.9 and 30310 of the Penal Code, relating to firearms."

(B) Children participating in the federal National School Lunch Program will not be overtly identified by the use of special tokens, special tickets, special serving lines, separate entrances, separate dining areas, or by any other means.

(b) The governing board of each school district and each county superintendent of schools shall formulate a plan, which shall be mailed to the State Department of Education for its approval, that will ensure that children eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals and milk shall not be treated differently from other children.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires each school district and county superintendent of schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to provide for each needy pupil one nutritionally adequate, free or reduced-price meal during each schoolday. Existing law requires the governing board of a school district and the county superintendent of schools to make applications for free or reduced-price meals available to pupils at all times during each regular schoolday. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to supervise the implementation of this program and to investigate acts of alleged noncompliance.
This bill would authorize the governing boards of school districts and county superintendents of schools to also make applications for free or reduced-price meals electronically available online. The bill would specify requirements that would have to be met by the governing boards of school districts, county offices of education, and school food authorities who choose to provide access to an online application under this bill.
The bill would require all applications to include clear instructions for families that are homeless or are migrants. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 49557 of the Education Code, relating to pupil nutrition."

Existing state law prohibits a law enforcement official, as defined, from detaining an individual on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody, unless, at the time that the individual becomes eligible for release from custody, certain conditions are met, including, among other things, that the individual has been convicted at any time of a felony for specified offenses and the continued detention of the individual on the basis of the immigration hold would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or any local policy.
This bill would expand the list of prior felony convictions to include the conviction of a felony which formed the basis upon which the individual was previously deported, thereby allowing a law enforcement official, if the continued detention of the individual on the basis of the immigration hold would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or any local policy, to detain an individual with that felony conviction on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody.","An act to amend Section 7282.5 of the Government Code, relating to state government."

Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health.

The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees.
This bill, among other things, would permit a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device to make the product available to eligible patients with terminal illnesses, as specified. The bill would authorize, but not require, a health benefit plan, as defined, or governmental agency to provide coverage for any investigational drug, biological product, or device made available pursuant to these provisions or the associated costs. The bill would prohibit the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California from taking any disciplinary action against the license of a physician based solely on the physician’s recommendation to an eligible patient regarding, or prescription for or treatment with, an investigational drug, biological product, or device, provided that the recommendation or prescription is consistent with medical standards of care. The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider’s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that an eligible patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device. The bill would prohibit an official, employee, or agent of the state from blocking an eligible patient’s access to the investigational drug, biological product, or device pursuant to the bill’s provisions.","An act to add Article 4.3 (commencing with Section 111547) to Chapter 6 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to drugs and devices."

(2) Persons placed on parole on or after July 1, 2012, shall successfully complete a sex offender management program, following the standards developed pursuant to Section 9003, as a condition of parole. The length of the period in the program shall be not less than one year, up to the entire period of parole, as determined by the certified sex offender management professional in consultation with the parole officer and as approved by the court. Participation in this program applies to every person described without regard to when his or her crime or crimes were committed.
(3) Waiver of any privilege against self-incrimination and participation in polygraph examinations, which shall be part of the sex offender management program.
(4) Waiver of any psychotherapist-patient privilege to enable communication between the sex offender management professional and supervising parole officer, pursuant to Section 290.09.
(e) Any defendant ordered to be placed in an approved sex offender management treatment program pursuant to subdivision (d) shall be responsible for paying the expense of his or her participation in the program. The department shall take into consideration the ability of the defendant to pay, and no defendant shall be denied discharge onto parole because of his or her inability to pay.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, requires every inmate who has been convicted of an offense that requires him or her to register as a sex offender or any attempt to commit any of those offenses and who is committed to prison and released on parole to be monitored by a global positioning system for life. Existing law requires the terms of probation or parole for all persons placed on formal probation or parole for an offense that requires registration as a sex offender to include, among other things, participation in, or completion of, a sex offender management program, as specified.
This bill would make it a felony for a person to willfully remove or disable an electronic, global positioning system, or other monitoring device, if the device was affixed as a condition of parole, postrelease community supervision, or probation as a result of a conviction of certain specified sex offenses, if the person intended to evade supervision and either does not surrender, or is not apprehended, within one week of the issuance of a warrant for absconding, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years. The bill would require the terms of probation or parole of a person who has committed a violation of these provisions to include participation and completion of a sex offender management program. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 1203.067 and 3008 of, and to add Section 645.5 to, the Penal Code, relating to sex offenders."
207,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 399.15 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
399.15.
(a) In order to fulfill unmet long-term resource needs, the commission shall establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources as a specified percentage of total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers each compliance period to achieve the targets established under this article. For any retail seller procuring at least 14 percent of retail sales from eligible renewable energy resources in 2010, the deficits associated with any previous renewables portfolio standard shall not be added to any procurement requirement pursuant to this article.
(b) The commission shall implement renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements only as follows:
(1) Each retail seller shall procure a minimum quantity of eligible renewable energy resources for each of the following compliance periods:
(A) January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, inclusive.
(B) January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, inclusive.
(C) January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, inclusive.
(2) (A) No later than January 1, 2012, the commission shall establish the quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to be procured by the retail seller for each compliance period. These quantities shall be established in the same manner for all retail sellers and result in the same percentages used to establish compliance period quantities for all retail sellers.
(B) In establishing quantities for the compliance period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, inclusive, the commission shall require procurement for each retail seller equal to an average of 20 percent of retail sales. For the following compliance periods, the quantities shall reflect reasonable progress in each of the intervening years sufficient to ensure that the procurement of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources achieves 25 percent of retail sales by December 31, 2016, and 33 percent of retail sales by December 31, 2020. The commission shall require retail sellers to procure not less than 33 percent of retail sales of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources in all subsequent years.
(C) Retail sellers shall be obligated to procure no less than the quantities associated with all intervening years by the end of each compliance period. Retail sellers shall not be required to demonstrate a specific quantity of procurement for any individual intervening year.
(3) The commission may require the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the quantities specified in paragraph (2). The commission shall evaluate the
economic impacts
benefits and costs to the California economy, including
upon low- and middle-income individuals and families
and disadvantaged communities,
before exercise of its authority pursuant to this paragraph to increase the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources. In performing its evaluation, the commission shall conduct duly noticed public workshops throughout the state to allow for public comment and consideration of the economic findings. These workshops shall be completed not less than 60 days prior to consideration by the commission of a rule that would require procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the quantities specified in paragraph (2).
(4) Only for purposes of establishing the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements of paragraph (1) and determining the quantities pursuant to paragraph (2), the commission shall include all electricity sold to retail customers by the Department of Water Resources pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code in the calculation of retail sales by an electrical corporation.
(5) The commission shall waive enforcement of this section if it finds that the retail seller has demonstrated any of the following conditions are beyond the control of the retail seller and will prevent compliance:
(A) There is inadequate transmission capacity to allow for sufficient electricity to be delivered from proposed eligible renewable energy resource projects using the current operational protocols of the Independent System Operator. In making its findings relative to the existence of this condition with respect to a retail seller that owns transmission lines, the commission shall consider both of the following:
(i) Whether the retail seller has undertaken, in a timely fashion, reasonable measures under its control and consistent with its obligations under local, state, and federal laws and regulations, to develop and construct new transmission lines or upgrades to existing lines intended to transmit electricity generated by eligible renewable energy resources. In determining the reasonableness of a retail seller’s actions, the commission shall consider the retail seller’s expectations for full-cost recovery for these transmission lines and upgrades.
(ii) Whether the retail seller has taken all reasonable operational measures to maximize cost-effective deliveries of electricity from eligible renewable energy resources in advance of transmission availability.
(B) Permitting, interconnection, or other circumstances that delay procured eligible renewable energy resource projects, or there is an insufficient supply of eligible renewable energy resources available to the retail seller. In making a finding that this condition prevents timely compliance, the commission shall consider whether the retail seller has done all of the following:
(i) Prudently managed portfolio risks, including relying on a sufficient number of viable projects.
(ii) Sought to develop one of the following: its own eligible renewable energy resources, transmission to interconnect to eligible renewable energy resources, or energy storage used to integrate eligible renewable energy resources. This clause shall not require an electrical corporation to pursue development of eligible renewable energy resources pursuant to Section 399.14.
(iii) Procured an appropriate minimum margin of procurement above the minimum procurement level necessary to comply with the renewables portfolio standard to compensate for foreseeable delays or insufficient supply.
(iv) Taken reasonable measures, under the control of the retail seller, to procure cost-effective distributed generation and allowable unbundled renewable energy credits.
(C) Unanticipated curtailment of eligible renewable energy resources necessary to address the needs of a balancing authority.
(6) If the commission waives the compliance requirements of this section, the commission shall establish additional reporting requirements on the retail seller to demonstrate that all reasonable actions under the control of the retail seller are taken in each of the intervening years sufficient to satisfy future procurement requirements.
(7) The commission shall not waive enforcement pursuant to this section, unless the retail seller demonstrates that it has taken all reasonable actions under its control, as set forth in paragraph (5), to achieve full compliance.
(8) If a retail seller fails to procure sufficient eligible renewable energy resources to comply with a procurement requirement pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) and fails to obtain an order from the commission waiving enforcement pursuant to paragraph (5), the commission shall exercise its authority pursuant to Section 2113.
(9) Deficits associated with the compliance period shall not be added to a future compliance period.
(c) The commission shall establish a limitation for each electrical corporation on the procurement expenditures for all eligible renewable energy resources used to comply with the renewables portfolio standard. In establishing this limitation, the commission shall rely on the following:
(1) The most recent renewable energy procurement plan.
(2) Procurement expenditures that approximate the expected cost of building, owning, and operating eligible renewable energy resources.
(3) The potential that some planned resource additions may be delayed or canceled.
(d) In developing the limitation pursuant to subdivision (c), the commission shall ensure all of the following:
(1) The limitation is set at a level that prevents disproportionate rate impacts.
(2) The costs of all procurement credited toward achieving the renewables portfolio standard are counted towards the limitation.
(3) Procurement expenditures do not include any indirect expenses, including imbalance energy charges, sale of excess energy, decreased generation from existing resources, transmission upgrades, or the costs associated with relicensing any utility-owned hydroelectric facilities.
(e) (1) No later than January 1, 2016, the commission shall prepare a report to the Legislature assessing whether each electrical corporation can achieve a 33-percent renewables portfolio standard by December 31, 2020, and maintain that level thereafter, within the adopted cost limitations. If the commission determines that it is necessary to change the limitation for procurement costs incurred by any electrical corporation after that date, it may propose a revised cap consistent with the criteria in subdivisions (c) and (d). The proposed modifications shall take effect no earlier than January 1, 2017.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the requirement for submitting a report imposed under paragraph (1) is inoperative on January 1, 2021.
(3) A report to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(f) If the cost limitation for an electrical corporation is insufficient to support the projected costs of meeting the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements, the electrical corporation may refrain from entering into new contracts or constructing facilities beyond the quantity that can be procured within the limitation, unless eligible renewable energy resources can be procured without exceeding a de minimis increase in rates, consistent with the long-term procurement plan established for the electrical corporation pursuant to Section 454.5.
(g) (1) The commission shall monitor the status of the cost limitation for each electrical corporation in order to ensure compliance with this article.
(2) If the commission determines that an electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation prior to achieving the renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements, the commission shall do both of the following within 60 days of making that determination:
(A) Investigate and identify the reasons why the electrical corporation may exceed its annual cost limitation.
(B) Notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature that the electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation, and include the reasons why the electrical corporation may exceed its cost limitation.
(h) The establishment of a renewables portfolio standard shall not constitute implementation by the commission of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617).","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, as defined. The Public Utilities Act imposes various duties and responsibilities on the commission with respect to the purchase of electricity and requires the commission to review and adopt a procurement plan and a renewable energy procurement plan for each electrical corporation pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (RPS program). The RPS program requires the commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-customers during specified compliance periods. Existing law authorizes the commission to require a retail seller to procure eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the specified quantities.
This bill would require that the commission evaluate the
economic impacts
benefits and costs to the California economy, including
upon low- and middle-income individuals and families
and disadvantaged communities,
before exercise of its authority to increase the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the specified quantities. The bill would require the commission, in performing its evaluation, to conduct duly noticed public workshops throughout the state to allow for public comment and consideration of the economic findings.","An act to amend Section 399.15 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides that a minor may be adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court under specified circumstances. Existing law authorizes the court to place a minor who has been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian in foster care, among other placements. Existing law extends certain foster care benefits to youth up to 21 years of age, known as nonminor dependents if specified conditions are met.
Under existing law, a county social worker develops a case plan for a minor or nonminor dependent that, among other things, identifies specific goals and the appropriateness of the planned services in meeting those goals. Existing law requires, if out-of-home placement is used to attain case plan goals, the case plan to include a description of the type of home or institution in which the child is to be placed, and the reasons for that placement decision. Existing law also specifies certain factors that must be considered in making a placement decision.
This bill would require children and nonminor dependents in an out-of-home placement to be placed according to their gender identity, regardless of the gender or sex listed in their court or child welfare records. By expanding the duties of counties relating to the placement of foster children and nonminor dependents, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law provides that it is the policy of the state that all minors and nonminors in foster care have specified rights, including, among others, the right to have fair and equal access to all available services, placement, care, treatment, and benefits, and to not be subjected to discrimination or harassment on the basis of actual or perceived race, ethnic group identification, ancestry, national origin, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental or physical disability, or HIV status.
This bill would additionally specify that all minors and nonminors in foster care have the right to be placed in out-of-home care according to their gender identity, regardless of the gender or sex listed in their court or child welfare records. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations consistent with this provision.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

209,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 21178 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
21178.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) requires that the environmental impacts of development projects be identified and mitigated.
(b) The act also guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on the environmental impacts of a project and to participate meaningfully in the development of mitigation measures for potentially significant environmental impacts.
(c) There are large projects under consideration in various regions of the state that would replace old and outmoded facilities with new job-creating facilities to meet those regions’ needs while also establishing new, cutting-edge environmental benefits to those regions.
(d) These projects are privately financed or financed from revenues generated from the projects themselves and do not require taxpayer financing.
(e) These projects further will generate thousands of full-time jobs during construction and thousands of additional permanent jobs once they are constructed and operating.
(f) These projects also present an unprecedented opportunity to implement nation-leading innovative measures that will significantly reduce traffic, air quality, and other significant environmental impacts, and fully mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from passenger vehicle trips attributed to the project.
(g) These pollution reductions will be the best in the nation compared to other comparable projects in the United States.
(h) The purpose of this chapter is to provide unique and unprecedented streamlining benefits under the California Environmental Quality Act for projects that provide the benefits described above for a limited period of time to put people to work as soon as possible.
SEC. 2.
Section 21181 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
21181.
This chapter does not apply to a project if the Governor does not certify the project as an environmental leadership development project eligible for streamlining pursuant to this chapter prior to January 1, 2018.
SEC. 3.
Section 21183 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
21183.
The Governor may certify a leadership project for streamlining pursuant to this chapter if all the following conditions are met:
(a) The project will result in a minimum investment of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in California upon completion of construction.
(b) (1) The project creates high-wage, highly skilled jobs that pay prevailing wages and living wages and provide construction jobs and permanent jobs for Californians, and helps reduce unemployment. For purposes of this subdivision, “jobs that pay prevailing wages” means that all construction workers employed in the execution of the project will receive at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for the type of work and geographic area, as determined by the Director of Industrial Relations pursuant to Sections 1773 and 1773.9 of the Labor Code. If the project is certified for streamlining, the project applicant shall include this requirement in all contracts for the performance of the work.
(2) (A) If the project is certified pursuant to this chapter, contractors and subcontractors shall pay to all construction workers employed in the execution of the project at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages.
(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the obligation of the contractors and subcontractors to pay prevailing wages pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be enforced by the Labor Commissioner through the issuance of a civil wage and penalty assessment pursuant to Section 1741 of the Labor Code, which may be reviewed pursuant to Section 1742 of the Labor Code, within 18 months after the completion of the project, or by an underpaid worker through an administrative complaint or civil action. If a civil wage and penalty assessment is issued, the contractor, subcontractor, and surety on a bond or bonds issued to secure the payment of wages covered by the assessment shall be liable for liquidated damages pursuant to Section 1742.1 of the Labor Code.
(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply if all contractors and subcontractors performing work on the project are subject to a project labor agreement that requires the payment of prevailing wages to all construction workers employed in the execution of the project and provides for enforcement of that obligation through an arbitration procedure. For purposes of this subparagraph, “project labor agreement” has the same meaning as set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 2500 of the Public Contract Code.
(c) The project does not result in any net additional emission of greenhouse gases, including greenhouse gas emissions from employee transportation, as determined by the State Air Resources Board pursuant to Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code.
(d) The project applicant has entered into a binding and enforceable agreement that all mitigation measures required pursuant to this division to certify the project under this chapter shall be conditions of approval of the project, and those conditions will be fully enforceable by the lead agency or another agency designated by the lead agency. In the case of environmental mitigation measures, the applicant agrees, as an ongoing obligation, that those measures will be monitored and enforced by the lead agency for the life of the obligation.
(e) The project applicant agrees to pay the costs of the Court of Appeal in hearing and deciding any case, including payment of the costs for the appointment of a special master if deemed appropriate by the court, in a form and manner specified by the Judicial Council, as provided in the Rules of Court adopted by the Judicial Council pursuant to Section 21185.
(f) The project applicant agrees to pay the costs of preparing the administrative record for the project concurrent with review and consideration of the project pursuant to this division, in a form and manner specified by the lead agency for the project.

Section 21184.5 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
21184.5.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, except as provided in subdivision (b), a multifamily residential project certified under this chapter shall provide unbundled parking, such that private vehicle parking spaces are priced and rented or purchased separately from dwelling units.
(b) Subdivision (a) shall not apply if the dwelling units are subject to affordability restrictions in law that prescribe rent or sale prices, and the cost of parking spaces cannot be unbundled from the cost of dwelling units.
SEC. 5.
Section 21189.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
21189.1.
If, prior to January 1, 2019, a lead agency fails to approve a project certified by the Governor pursuant to this chapter, then the certification expires and is no longer valid.
SEC. 6.
Section 21189.3 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
21189.3.
This chapter shall remain in effect until January 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed unless a later enacted statute extends or repeals that date.
SEC. 7.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.
SEC. 8.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to reauthorize the Governor to certify projects as environmental leadership development projects in 2016 and prevent a one-year gap in this authorization, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.
The Jobs and Economic Improvement Through Environmental Leadership Act of 2011 authorizes the Governor, until January 1, 2016, to certify projects meeting certain requirements, including the requirement that the project creates high-wage, highly skilled jobs that pay prevailing wages and living wages, for streamlining benefits provided by that act. The act provides that if a lead agency fails to approve a project certified by the Governor before January 1, 2017, then the certification expires and is no longer valid. The act requires a lead agency to prepare the record of proceedings for the certified project concurrent with the preparation of the environmental documents. The act is repealed by its own terms on January 1, 2017.
This bill would extend the authority of the Governor to certify a project to January 1, 2018. The bill would provide that the certification expires and is no longer valid if the lead agency fails to approve a certified project before January 1, 2019. If a project is certified by the Governor, the bill would require contractors and subcontractors to pay to all construction workers employed in the execution of the project at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages and would provide for the enforcement of this requirement. The bill would repeal the act on January 1, 2019. Because the bill would extend the obligation of the lead agency to prepare concurrently the record of proceedings, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, notwithstanding any other law, require a multifamily residential project certified pursuant to the act to provide private vehicle parking spaces that are priced and rented or purchased separately from dwelling units, except as provided.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 21178, 21181, 21183, 21189.1, and 21189.3 of, and to add Section 21184.5 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to environmental quality, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

(2) The recipients of funds expended from the California Advanced Services Fund in the prior year.
(3) The geographic regions of the state affected by funds expended from the California Advanced Services Fund in the prior year, including information by county.
(4) The expected benefits to be derived from the funds expended from the California Advanced Services Fund in the prior year.
(5) Details on the status of each project funded through the California Advanced Services Fund, whether the project has been completed, and, if applicable, the expected completion date of the project.
(6) Actual broadband adoption levels from the funds expended from the California Advanced Services Fund in the prior year.
(7) The amount of funds expended from the California Advanced Services Fund used to match federal funds.
(8) Additional details on efforts to leverage non-California Advanced Services Fund funds.
(9) An update on the expenditures from the California Advanced Services Fund and broadband adoption levels, and an accounting of remaining unserved and underserved households and areas of the state.
(10) The status of the California Advanced Services Fund balance and the projected amount to be collected in each year through 2020 to fund approved projects.
(b) Pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, this section is repealed on January 1, 2022.","Existing law, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, establishes a program of cooperative federalism for the regulation of telecommunications to attain the goal of local competition, while implementing specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, consistent with certain universal service principles. The universal service principles include the principle that consumers in all regions of the nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas. The act authorizes each state to adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within the state, only to the extent that they adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms that do not rely on or burden federal universal service support mechanisms.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations, as defined. Existing law establishes the California Advanced Services Fund, referred to as the CASF, in the State Treasury. Existing law requires the commission to develop, implement, and administer the CASF to encourage deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all Californians that will promote economic growth, job creation, and the substantial social benefits of advanced information and communications technologies, as provided in specified decisions of the commission and in the CASF statute.
Existing law establishes the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account within the CASF. Existing law provides that moneys in the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account are available for grants to eligible consortia to fund the cost of broadband deployment activities other than the capital cost of facilities, as specified by the commission, and provides that an eligible consortium may include representatives of organizations, including local and regional government, public safety, elementary and secondary education, health care, libraries, postsecondary education, community-based organizations, tourism, parks and recreation, agricultural, and business.
This bill would specifically include representatives of workforce organizations and air pollution control or air quality management districts amongst the persons that can be included in an eligible consortium.
Existing law establishes the Broadband Public Housing Account within the CASF. Existing law provides that moneys in that account are available for, among other things, grants and loans to publicly supported communities to finance projects to connect to broadband networks.
This bill would require the commission, in its review of applications for grants and loans for this purpose, to prioritize unserved housing developments, as defined.
Existing law transferred moneys from other accounts within the CASF to the Broadband Public Housing Account for various specified purposes and provided that those transferred moneys not awarded by December 31, 2016, would be returned to the accounts from which they were transferred.
This bill would postpone the return of those moneys until December 31, 2020. By authorizing the granting of moneys remaining in the Broadband Public Housing Account until that date, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law requires the commission to annually report to the Legislature on the expenditures of CASF funds, as specified, including the geographic regions of the state affected by those expenditures in the prior year.
This bill would require the commission’s report to the Legislature to include that information by county, details on efforts to leverage non-CASF funds, the status of each project funded through the CASF, whether the project has been completed, and, if applicable, the expected completion date of the project.","An act to amend Sections 281 and 914.7 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to telecommunications, and making an appropriation therefor."

Health and Safety Code
is amended to read:
1596.65.

(b) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars ($100).","Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of home health agencies by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law requires all private or public organizations that provide or arrange for skilled nursing services to patients in the home to obtain a home health agency license.
Existing law, the California Hospice Licensure Act of 1990 (the act), provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Department of Public Health of persons or agencies that provide hospice services to persons, and the families of persons, who are experiencing the last phases of life due to a terminal disease. The act prohibits a person, political subdivision of the state, or other governmental agency from establishing or operating a hospice without first obtaining a license. Existing federal law also provides for the certification of hospice care for purposes of Medicare reimbursement. Existing law exempts a hospice program certified in accordance with federal Medicare hospice conditions of participation from the requirement to obtain a license pursuant to the act, but provides that the program is subject to home health agency licensure unless it elects to apply for hospice licensure.
This bill instead would exempt a licensed home health agency from the requirement to obtain a license to provide hospice services if the hospice program is certified in accordance with federal Medicare hospice conditions of participation or is in the process of obtaining that certification. The bill would also make conforming changes.
Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish a trustline registry for trustline providers who meet prescribed requirements. Existing law defines a trustline provider as a person 18 years of age or older who provides child care, supervision, or in-home educational or counseling services, and who is not required to be licensed as a child day care facility. Existing law prohibits an employment agency from making a referral of a child care provider unless the child care provider is a trustline applicant or registered child care provider.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to a provision related to the trustline registry.","An act to amend

SECTION 1.
Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 6033) is added to Chapter 5 of Title 7 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, to read:
Article  1.5. Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015
6033.
This article shall be known, and may be cited, as the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015.
6033.2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Legislature is committed to reducing recidivism among criminal offenders, ensuring that local governments have adequate funding to achieve this goal, and facilitating the responsible implementation of the criminal justice policies contained in the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(b) By enacting the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, the Legislature affirmed its commitment to justice reinvestment and stated that the purpose of justice reinvestment is to manage criminal justice populations more cost effectively, generating savings that can be reinvested in evidence-based strategies that increase public safety while holding offenders accountable.
(c) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety represents a significant shift of responsibilities. However, the quick and unanticipated nature of the passage of this legislation, in combination with broad county discretion in its implementation, offers a unique opportunity to identify best practices in community corrections and the impacts of correctional decentralization.
(d) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety did not require counties to collect data on outcome measures, nor did it provide specific resources for data collection that if adequately funded and properly implemented would allow policymakers, researchers, stakeholders, and counties to take advantage of the historic opportunity to study and evaluate the changing felon population and the strategies and interventions that counties employ to reduce recidivism.
(e) The Bureau of State Audits’ September 2013 High Risk report identified the 2011 realignment of criminal justice responsibilities between the state and counties as a “high-risk” policy, citing a lack of “reliable and meaningful realignment data to ensure [the state’s] ability to effectively monitor progress toward achieving intended realignment goals.”

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to ensure that relevant data pertaining to the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety are collected and reported as soon as possible to allow stakeholders to measure the effectiveness of this landmark change in public safety policy, it is necessary that this bill go into immediate effect.","Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to collect and maintain available information and data about state and community correctional policies, practices, capacities, and needs, as specified.

(2) Provisions conforming to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f).
(3) A provision limiting the MTA’s costs of administering the ordinance and the net revenues from the tax to 1.5 percent of the total tax revenues.
(4) A requirement that the net revenues from the tax, defined to mean the total tax revenues less any refunds, costs of administration by the State Board of Equalization, and the MTA’s administration costs, shall be used by the MTA to fund transportation projects and programs identified in the expenditure plan.
(5) The rate of the tax.
(c) The MTA shall do all of the following:
(1) Develop a transparent process to determine the most recent costs estimates for each project and program identified in the expenditure plan.
(2) At least 30 days before submitting the ordinance described in subdivision (b) to the voters, post the expenditure plan on its Internet Web site in a prominent manner.
(d) The ordinance shall be adopted by the MTA board, which shall also adopt a resolution that submits the ordinance to the voters.
(e) The ordinance shall become operative pursuant to Section 130352 if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2 of Article XIII C of the California Constitution.
(f) (1) If the voters approve the ordinance authorized by this section, the expenditure plan included as an exhibit to the ordinance pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) shall also be included in the revised and updated Long Range Transportation Plan within one year of the date the ordinance takes effect. The revised and updated Long Range Transportation Plan shall also include capital projects and capital programs that are adopted by each subregion that are submitted to the MTA for inclusion in the revised and updated Long Range Transportation Plan, if the cost and schedule details are provided by the subregions, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the plan. Inclusion of a capital project or a capital program in the Long Range Transportation Plan is not a commitment or guarantee that the project or program shall receive any future funding.
(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “subregion” shall have the same meaning as defined in the Long Range Transportation Plan.
(g) The MTA may incur bonded indebtedness payable from the net revenues of the tax pursuant to the bond issuance provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 130500) and any successor act.
(h) The tax authorized by this section shall be imposed pursuant to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), notwithstanding the combined rate limitation in Section 7251.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.","Existing law authorizes the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose, in addition to any other tax that it is authorized to impose, a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5% for the funding of specified transportation-related projects and programs, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval. Existing law authorizes the MTA to seek voter approval to extend the transactions and use tax pursuant to an amended ordinance, subject to various requirements, including adoption of an amended expenditure plan that, among other things, updates certain cost estimates and identifies expected completion dates for projects and programs under the previous expenditure plan, and also requires the amended expenditure plan to be included in an updated long range transportation plan, as specified.
This bill would delete the above-referenced provisions relative to extension of the transactions and use tax and an amended ordinance and expenditure plan, The bill would instead authorize the MTA to impose an additional transportation transactions and use tax at a maximum rate of 0.5% as long as a specified existing 0.5% transactions and use tax is in effect, and at a maximum rate of 1% thereafter, as specified, for a period of time determined by the MTA, if certain conditions exist and subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval, as specified.
The Transactions and Use Tax Law limits to 2% the combined rate of all transactions and use taxes imposed in any county, with certain exceptions.
This bill would exempt the transactions and use tax authorized by the bill from this limitation.","An act to amend Section 130350.5 of, to add Section 130350.7 to, and to repeal Section 130350.6 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to transportation."

(2) In any action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.

Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Nothing in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.
(2) No action shall be brought under this part for any violation of a posting, notice, agency reporting, or filing requirement of this code, except where the filing or reporting requirement involves mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting.
(h) No action may be brought under this section by an aggrieved employee if the agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within the timeframes set forth in Section 2699.3 for a violation of the same section or sections of the Labor Code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or others or initiates a proceeding pursuant to Section 98.3.

SECTION 1.
Section 1947.8 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
1947.8.
(a) If an ordinance or charter controls or establishes a system of controls on the price at which residential rental units may be offered for rent or lease and requires the registration of rents, the ordinance or charter, or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall provide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels for the registered rental units, and any changes thereafter to those rent levels, by the local agency as provided in this section.
(b) If the ordinance, charter, or regulation is in effect on January 1, 1987, the ordinance, charter, or regulation shall provide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels on or before January 1, 1988, including completion of all appeals and administrative proceedings connected therewith. After July 1, 1990, no local agency may maintain any action to recover excess rent against any property owner who has registered the unit with the local agency within the time limits set forth in this section if the initial certification of permissible rent levels affecting that particular property has not been completed, unless the delay is willfully and intentionally caused by the property owner or is a result of court proceedings or further administrative proceedings ordered by a court. If the ordinance, charter, or regulation is adopted on or after January 1, 1987, the ordinance, charter, or regulation shall provide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels within one year after it is adopted, including completion of all appeals and administrative proceedings connected therewith. Upon the request of the landlord or the tenant, the local agency shall provide the landlord and the tenant with a certificate or other documentation reflecting the permissible rent levels of the rental unit. A landlord may request a certificate of permissible rent levels for rental units which have a base rent established, but which are vacant and not exempt from registration under this section. The landlord or the tenant may appeal the determination of the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate. The permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate or other documentation shall, in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, be binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless the determination of the permissible rent levels is being appealed.
(c) After the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels under subdivision (b), the local agency shall, upon the request of the landlord or the tenant, provide the landlord and the tenant with a certificate of the permissible rent levels of the rental unit. The certificate shall be issued within five business days from the date of request by the landlord or the tenant. The permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate shall, in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, be binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless the determination of the permissible rent levels is being appealed. The landlord or the tenant may appeal the determination of the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate. Any appeal of a determination of permissible rent levels as reflected in the certificate, other than an appeal made pursuant to subdivision (b), shall be filed with the local agency within 15 days from issuance of the certificate. The local agency shall notify, in writing, the landlord and the tenant of its decision within 60 days following the filing of the appeal.
(d) The local agency may charge the person to whom a certificate is issued a fee in the amount necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the local agency in issuing the certificate.
(e) The absence of a certification of permissible rent levels shall not impair, restrict, abridge, or otherwise interfere with either of the following:
(1) A judicial or administrative hearing.
(2) Any matter in connection with a conveyance of an interest in property.
(f) The record of permissible rent levels is a public record for purposes of the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).
(g) Any notice specifying the rents applicable to residential rental units which is given by an owner to a public entity or tenant in order to comply with Chapter 12.75 (commencing with Section 7060) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code shall not be considered a registration of rents for purposes of this section.
(h) “Local agency,” as used in this section, means the public entity responsible for the implementation of the ordinance, charter, or regulation.
(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed:
(1) To grant to any public entity any power which it does not possess independent of this section to control or establish a system of control on the price at which accommodations may be offered for rent or lease, or to diminish any such power which that public entity may possess, except as specifically provided in this section.
(2) On and after January 1, 2016, to apply to tenancies commencing on or after January 1, 1999, for which the owner of residential property may establish the initial rent under Chapter 2.7 (commencing with Section 1954.50). However, for a tenancy that commenced on or after January 1, 1999, if a property owner has provided the local agency with the tenancy’s initial rent in compliance with that agency’s registration requirements in a writing signed under penalty of perjury, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the statement of the initial rent is correct.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law regulates the terms and conditions of residential tenancies. Existing law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, prescribes statewide limits on the application of local rent control with regard to certain properties, including those that have a certificate of occupancy issued after February 1, 1995. Existing law requires a local ordinance or charter controlling residential rent prices that requires registration of rents to provide for the certification of permissible rent levels and prescribes a process in this regard, including a requirement that, upon the request, a local agency provide a landlord and a tenant with a certificate reflecting the permissible rent levels of the rental unit. Existing law provides that the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate are, in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless the determination of the permissible rent levels is appealed.
This bill would specify that the certification provisions described above, on and after January 1, 2016, do not apply to tenancies for which the owner of residential property may establish the initial rent under the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, as specified. The bill would except from this exclusion a tenancy for which the property owner provides the local rent control agency with a writing, signed under penalty of perjury, of the tenancy’s initial rent that complies with the agency’s requirements, which would create a rebuttable presumption that the statement of the initial rent is correct. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that there is a process that management and supervisors in a state health care facility are required to follow to avoid on-the-spot mandatory overtime of any psychiatric technician (PT) or psychiatric technician assistant (PTA) whose regularly scheduled work shift is complete, and to prevent circumstances where an employee is stopped at the gate of, for example, a Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services facility, and is instructed to return to work at the end of the employee’s regularly scheduled work shift. It is the intent of the Legislature to prohibit a state facility that employs PTs or PTAs from using mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool, or as an excuse for fulfilling an operational need that results from a management failure to properly staff those state facilities.

(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Emergency situation” means any of the following:
(A) An unforeseeable declared national, state, or municipal emergency.
(B) A highly unusual or extraordinary event that is unpredictable or unavoidable and that substantially affects providing needed health care services or increases the need for health care services, which includes any of the following:
(i) An act of terrorism.
(ii) A natural disaster.
(iii) A widespread disease outbreak.
(iv) An emergency declared by a warden, superintendent, or executive director, or a severe emergency that necessitates the assistance of an outside agency.
(2) “Facility” means any facility that provides clinically related health services that is operated by the Division of Correctional Health Care Services of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the State Department of State Hospitals, or the State Department of Developmental Services in which a PT or PTA works as an employee of the state.
(3) “Management or supervisor” means any person or group of persons acting directly or indirectly on behalf of, or in the interest of, the facility, whose duties and responsibilities include facilitating staffing needs.
(4) “On call or on standby” means alternative staff who are not currently working on the premises of the facility and who satisfy either of the following criteria:
(A) Are compensated for their availability.
(B) Have agreed to be available to come to the facility on short notice, if the need arises.
(5) “PT” or “PTA” means all classifications of psychiatric technician or psychiatric technician assistant.
(b) A facility shall not require a PT or PTA to work in excess of a regularly scheduled workweek or work shift. A PT or PTA may volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift but the refusal by a PT or PTA to accept those additional hours shall not constitute either of the following:
(1) Grounds for discrimination, dismissal, discharge, or any other penalty or employment decision adverse to the PT or PTA.
(2) Patient abandonment or neglect.
(c) In order to avoid the use of mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool, management and supervisors shall consider employees to fulfill the additional staffing needs of a facility in the following priority order:
(1) First priority shall be given to employees who volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to their regularly scheduled workweek or work shift.
(2) Second priority shall be given to individuals who are part-time or intermittent employees.
(3) Third priority shall be given to employees who are on call or on standby.
(d) This section shall not apply in any of the following situations:
(1) To a PT or PTA participating in a surgical procedure in which the nurse is actively engaged and whose continued presence through the completion of the procedure is needed to ensure the health and safety of the patient.
(2) If a catastrophic event occurs in a facility and both of the following factors apply:
(A) The catastrophic event results in such a large number of patients in need of immediate medical treatment for which the facility is incapable of providing sufficient PTs or PTAs to attend to the patients without resorting to mandatory overtime.
(B) The catastrophic event is an unanticipated and nonrecurring event.
(3) If an emergency situation occurs.
(e) This section shall not be construed to affect the Psychiatric Technicians Law (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 4500) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code) or a PT or PTA’s duty under the standards of competent performance.
(f) This section shall not be construed to preclude a facility from hiring part-time or intermittent employees.
(g) This section shall not prevent a facility from providing employees with more protections against mandatory overtime than the minimum protections established pursuant to this section.","The State Civil Service Act generally requires the workweek of state employees to be 40 hours, and the workday of state employees to be 8 hours. Under the act, it is the policy of the state to avoid the necessity for overtime work whenever possible.
The Psychiatric Technicians Law provides for the licensure and regulation of psychiatric technicians (PTs) by the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians of the State of California.
This bill would prohibit a PT or psychiatric technician assistant (PTA) employed by the State of California in a specified type of facility from being compelled to work in excess of the regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, except under certain circumstances. The bill would authorize a PT or PTA to volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, but the refusal to accept those additional hours would not constitute patient abandonment or neglect or be grounds for discrimination, dismissal, discharge, or any other penalty or employment decision adverse to the PT or PTA.

227,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 2833 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
2833.
(a) The commission shall require a green tariff shared renewables program to be administered by a participating utility in accordance with this section.
(b) Generating facilities participating in a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall be eligible renewable energy resources with a nameplate rated generating capacity not exceeding 20 megawatts, except for those generating facilities reserved for location in areas identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency as the most impacted and disadvantaged communities pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (d), which shall not exceed one megawatt nameplate rated generating capacity.
(c) A participating utility shall use commission-approved tools and mechanisms to procure additional eligible renewable energy resources for the green tariff shared renewables program from electrical generation facilities that are in addition to those required by the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1). For purposes of this subdivision, “commission-approved tools and mechanisms” means those procurement methods approved by the commission for an electrical corporation to procure eligible renewable energy resources for purposes of meeting the procurement requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1).
(d) A participating utility shall permit customers within the service territory of the utility to purchase electricity pursuant to the tariff approved by the commission to implement the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program, until the utility meets its proportionate share of a statewide limitation of 600 megawatts of customer participation, measured by nameplate rated generating capacity. The proportionate share shall be calculated based on the ratio of each participating utility’s retail sales to total retail sales of electricity by all participating utilities. The commission may place other restrictions on purchases under a green tariff shared renewables program, including restricting participation to a certain level of capacity each year. The following restrictions shall apply to the statewide 600 megawatt limitation:
(1) (A) One hundred megawatts shall be reserved for facilities that are no larger than one megawatt nameplate rated generating capacity and that are located in areas previously identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency as the most impacted and disadvantaged communities. These communities shall be identified by census tract, and shall be determined to be the most impacted 20 percent based on results from the best available cumulative impact screening methodology designed to identify each of the following:
(i) Areas disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and other hazards that can lead to negative public health effects, exposure, or environmental degradation.
(ii) Areas with socioeconomic vulnerability.
(B) (1) For purposes of this paragraph, “previously identified” means identified prior to commencing construction of the facility.
(2) Not less than 100 megawatts shall be reserved for participation by residential class customers.
(3) Twenty megawatts shall be reserved for the City of Davis.
(e) To the extent possible, a participating utility shall seek to procure eligible renewable energy resources that are located in reasonable proximity to enrolled participants.
(f) A participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall support diverse procurement and the goals of commission General Order 156.
(g) A participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall not allow a customer to subscribe to more than 100 percent of the customer’s electricity demand.
(h) Except as authorized by this subdivision, a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall not allow a customer to subscribe to more than two megawatts of nameplate generating capacity. This limitation does not apply to a federal, state, or local government, school or school district, county office of education, the California Community Colleges, the California State University, or the University of California.
(i) A participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall not allow any single entity or its affiliates or subsidiaries to subscribe to more than 20 percent of any single calendar year’s total cumulative rated generating capacity.
(j) To the extent possible, a participating utility shall actively market the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program to low-income and minority communities and customers.
(k) Participating customers shall receive bill credits for the generation of a participating eligible renewable energy resource using the class average retail generation cost as established in the participating utility’s approved tariff for the class to which the participating customer belongs, plus a renewables adjustment value representing the difference between the time-of-delivery profile of the eligible renewable energy resource used to serve the participating customer and the class average time-of-delivery profile and the resource adequacy value, if any, of the resource contained in the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program. The renewables adjustment value applicable to a time-of-delivery profile of an eligible renewable energy resource shall be determined according to rules adopted by the commission. For these purposes, “time-of-delivery profile” refers to the daily generating pattern of a participating eligible renewable energy resource over time, the value of which is determined by comparing the generating pattern of that participating eligible renewable energy resource to the demand for electricity over time and other generating resources available to serve that demand.
(l) Participating customers shall pay a renewable generation rate established by the commission, the administrative costs of the participating utility, and any other charges the commission determines are just and reasonable to fully cover the cost of procuring a green tariff shared renewables program’s resources to serve a participating customer’s needs.
(m) A participating customer’s rates shall be debited or credited with any other commission-approved costs or values applicable to the eligible renewable energy resources contained in a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program’s portfolio. These additional costs or values shall be applied to new customers when they initially subscribe after the cost or value has been approved by the commission.
(n) Participating customers shall pay all otherwise applicable charges without modification.
(o) A participating utility shall permit a participating customer to subscribe to the program and be provided with a nonbinding estimate of reasonably anticipated bill credits and bill charges, as determined by the commission, for a period of up to 20 years.
(p) A participating utility shall provide support for enhanced community renewables programs to facilitate development of eligible renewable energy resource projects located close to the source of demand.
(q) The commission shall ensure that charges and credits associated with a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program are set in a manner that ensures nonparticipant ratepayer indifference for the remaining bundled service, direct access, and community choice aggregation customers and ensures that no costs are shifted from participating customers to nonparticipating ratepayers.
(r) A participating utility shall track and account for all revenues and costs to ensure that the utility recovers the actual costs of the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program and that all costs and revenues are fully transparent and auditable.
(s) Any renewable energy credits associated with electricity procured by a participating utility for the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program and utilized by a participating customer shall be retired by the participating utility on behalf of the participating customer. Those renewable energy credits shall not be further sold, transferred, or otherwise monetized for any purpose. Any renewable energy credits associated with electricity procured by a participating utility for the shared renewable energy self-generation program, but not utilized by a participating customer, shall be counted toward meeting that participating utility’s renewables portfolio standard.
(t) A participating utility shall, in the event of participant customer attrition or other causes that reduce customer participation or electrical demand below generation levels, apply the excess generation from the eligible renewable energy resources procured through the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program to the utility’s renewable portfolio standard procurement obligations or bank the excess generation for future use to benefit all customers in accordance with the renewables portfolio standard banking and procurement rules approved by the commission.
(u) In calculating its procurement requirements to meet the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1), a participating utility may exclude from total retail sales the kilowatthours generated by an eligible renewable energy resource that is credited to a participating customer pursuant to the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program, commencing with the point in time at which the generating facility achieves commercial operation.
(v) All renewable energy resources procured on behalf of participating customers in the participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program shall comply with the State Air Resources Board’s Voluntary Renewable Electricity Program. California-eligible greenhouse gas allowances associated with these purchases shall be retired on behalf of participating customers as part of the board’s Voluntary Renewable Electricity Program.
(w) A participating utility shall provide a municipality with aggregated consumption data for participating customers within the municipality’s jurisdiction to allow for reporting on progress toward climate action goals by the municipality. A participating utility shall also publicly disclose, on a geographic basis, consumption data and reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases achieved by participating customers in the utility’s green tariff shared renewables program, on an aggregated basis consistent with privacy protections as specified in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 8380) of Division 4.1.
(x) Nothing in this section prohibits or restricts a community choice aggregator from offering its own voluntary renewable energy programs to participating customers of the community choice aggregation.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. The Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program requires a participating utility, defined as being an electrical corporation with 100,000 or more customers in California, to file with the commission an application requesting approval of a tariff to implement a program enabling ratepayers to participate in electrical generation facilities that use eligible renewable energy resources, consistent with certain legislative findings and statements of intent. Existing law requires the commission, by July 1, 2014, to issue a decision concerning the participating utility’s application, determining whether to approve or disapprove the application, with or without modifications. Existing law requires the commission, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to approve the application if the commission determines that the proposed program is reasonable and consistent with the legislative findings and statements of intent and requires the commission to require that a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program be administered in accordance with specified provisions. Existing law repeals the program on January 1, 2019.
This bill would require the commission to additionally require that a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program permit a participating customer to subscribe to the program and be provided with a nonbinding estimate of reasonably anticipated bill credits and bill charges, as determined by the commission, for a period of up to 20 years.
Under existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
Because the bill would require action by the commission to implement its requirements and a violation of those requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the definition of a crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 2833 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity."

(a) (1) On and after January 1, 2016, a prepaid MTS surcharge shall be imposed on each prepaid consumer and shall be collected by a seller from each prepaid consumer at the time of each retail transaction in this state. The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be imposed as a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in this state.
(2) The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be in lieu of any charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act (Part 20 (commencing with Section 41001)) and the Public Utilities Commission surcharges for prepaid mobile telephony services.
(b) The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be annually calculated by the board by no later than November 1 of each year commencing November 1, 2015, by adding the following:
(1) The surcharge rate reported pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 41030.

The posted combined rate shall be the rate that applies to all retail transactions during the calendar year beginning April 1 following the posting.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if a local agency notifies the board pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 42101.5 that the posted rate is inaccurate or it no longer imposes a local charge or local charges or that the rate of its local charge or local charges has decreased, the board shall promptly post a recalculated rate that is applicable to the jurisdiction of that local agency. The change shall become operative on the first day of the calendar quarter commencing more than 60 days from the date the local agency notifies the board of the inaccuracy or that it no longer imposes a local charge or that the rate of its local charge has decreased. Nothing in this section modifies the notice obligations of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code. However, beginning January 1, 2016, the notification and implementation requirements of paragraphs (5) and (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code shall not apply to prepaid mobile telephony services.
(3) The board shall also separately post on its Internet Web site the individual rates for each of the following:

(d) (1) Except for amounts retained pursuant to subdivision (e), and except as provided in subdivision (f) for a seller that is a direct seller, all amounts of the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges collected by sellers shall be remitted to the board pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 42020).
(2) A seller that is authorized to provide lifeline service under the state lifeline program or federal lifeline program, that sells prepaid mobile telephony services directly to the prepaid customer, shall remit the prepaid MTS surcharge to the board, less any applicable exemption from the surcharge that is applicable to the retail transaction pursuant to Section 42012.
(e) A seller that is not a direct seller shall be permitted to deduct and retain an amount equal to 2 percent of the amounts that are collected by the seller from prepaid consumers for the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges, on a pro rata basis, according to that portion of the revenues collected by the seller for each of the following:
(1) The emergency telephone users surcharge.
(2) The Public Utilities Commission surcharges.

(3) Local charges, if applicable, shall be remitted to the local jurisdiction or local agency imposing the local charge. Remittance of the local charges shall be separately identified from any other local taxes or other charges that are remitted to the local jurisdiction or local entity imposing the local tax or other charge.
(g) A direct seller shall utilize the amounts posted by the board pursuant to subdivision (c) when determining what amounts to remit to the Public Utilities Commission, board, and each local jurisdiction or local agency.
(h) A prepaid MTS provider shall offer prepaid consumers the option to make payment for additional prepaid usage directly to the prepaid MTS provider at the provider’s retail location or Internet Web site.
(i) The amount of the combined prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges shall be separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by the seller, or otherwise disclosed electronically to the prepaid consumer, at the time of the retail transaction.
(j) The prepaid MTS surcharge that is required to be collected by a seller and any amount unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that is not owed as part of the surcharge, but was collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that it was owed as part of the surcharge, constitute debts owed by the seller to this state. The local charge

debts
owed by the seller jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing that local charge.
(k) A seller that has collected any amount of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges in excess of the amount of the surcharge imposed by this part and actually due from a prepaid consumer may refund that amount to the prepaid consumer, even though the surcharge amount has already been paid over to the board and no corresponding credit or refund has yet been secured. Any seller making a refund of any charge to a prepaid consumer may repay therewith the amount of the surcharge paid.
(l) (1) Every prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services in this state is liable for the prepaid MTS surcharge and any local charges until they have been paid to this state, except that payment to a seller registered under this part relieves the prepaid consumer from further liability for the surcharge and local charges. Any surcharge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed to the state by the person required to collect and remit the surcharge. Any local charge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing the local charge by the person required to collect and remit the local charge. Nothing in this part shall impose any obligation upon a seller to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the surcharge or local charge imposed by this section.
(2) A credit shall be allowed against, but shall not exceed, the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges imposed on any prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by this part to the extent that the prepaid consumer has paid emergency telephone users charges, state utility regulatory commission fees, state universal service charges, or local charges on the purchase to any other state, political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. The credit shall be apportioned to the charges against which it is allowed in proportion to the amounts of those charges.
(m) (1) A seller is relieved from liability to collect the prepaid MTS surcharge imposed by this part that became due and payable, insofar as the base upon which the surcharge is imposed is represented by accounts that have been found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes by the seller or, if the seller is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A seller that has previously paid the surcharge may, under rules and regulations prescribed by the board, take as a deduction on its return the amount found worthless and charged off by the seller. If any such accounts are thereafter in whole or in part collected by the seller, the amount so collected shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the surcharge shall be paid with the return.
(2) The board may by regulation promulgate such other rules with respect to uncollected or worthless accounts as it shall deem necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to allow sufficient time to promulgate and adopt regulations necessary to implement the recently enacted Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Surcharge Act (Part 21 (commencing with Section 42001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) and Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Collection Act (Part 21.1 (commencing with Section 42100) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act generally imposes a surcharge on amounts paid by every person in the state for intrastate telephone service to provide revenues sufficient to fund “911” emergency telephone system costs, and requires the Office of Emergency Services to annually determine the surcharge rate. Commencing with the calculation made October 1, 2015, existing law requires the office to compute the charges applicable to the intrastate portion of prepaid mobile telephony services, as provided.
The Prepaid Mobile Telephony Service Surcharge Collection Act establishes a prepaid MTS surcharge, as defined, based upon a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in this state for prepaid mobile telephony services, as defined, that is imposed in lieu of any charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act and specified Public Utility Commission surcharges. That act requires the prepaid MTS surcharge to be annually calculated by the State Board of Equalization by November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2015, by using the emergency telephone user surcharge rate reported by the office and specified Public Utility Commission surcharges.
The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act requires the office to notify the board of the emergency telephone user surcharge rate and the emergency telephone user surcharge rate applicable to prepaid mobile telephony services by October 15 of each year.
This bill would instead require the office to notify the board of the emergency telephone user surcharge rate by October 1.
The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act requires, immediately upon notification by the office and fixing the surcharge rate, the board to notify by mail every registered service supplier of the new rate.
This bill would instead require the board to notify every registered service supplier of the new rate by means then available to it, including, but not limited to, mail, electronic mail, or Internet Web site postings.
This bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 41030, 41032, and 42010 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

Section 27375 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
27375.
(a) Any person who operates a modified limousine shall ensure that the vehicle has at least two rear side doors, as specified in paragraph (2), and one or two rear windows, as specified in paragraph (1), that the rear seat passengers or all passengers of the vehicle may open from the inside of the vehicle in case of any fire or other emergency that may require the immediate exit of the passengers of the vehicle. A limousine subject to this subdivision shall be equipped with both of the following:
(1) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), at least two rear push-out windows that are accessible to all passengers. At least one push-out window shall be located on each side of the vehicle, unless the design of the limousine precludes the installation of a push-out window on one side of the vehicle, in which case the second push-out window shall instead be located in the roof of the vehicle.
(B) If the design of the limousine precludes the installation of even one push-out window on a side of the vehicle, one push-out window shall instead be located in the roof of the vehicle.
(C) The Department of the California Highway Patrol shall establish, by regulation, standards to ensure that window exits are operable and sufficient in emergency situations for limousine passengers. The department shall ensure that these regulations comply with any applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.

(2) (A) At least two rear side doors that are accessible to all passengers and that may be opened manually by any passenger. At least one rear side door shall be located on each side of the vehicle.
(B) For modified limousines modified on or after July 1, 2015, at least one of these side doors shall be located near the driver’s compartment and another near the back of the vehicle.
(C) The rear side doors shall comply with any applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards as deemed necessary by the Department of the California Highway Patrol.

(2) Disclose to the contracting party and the passengers whether the limousine meets the safety requirements described in this section.
(3) If paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) applies, the owner or operator of a limousine shall further disclose to the contracting party and the passengers that the limousine does not meet the safety requirements required in subdivision (a) regarding vehicle escape options because of its exempt status, and therefore may pose a greater risk to passengers should emergency escape be necessary.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), subdivision (a) shall not apply to any limousine manufactured before 1970 that has an active transportation charter-party carrier (TCP) number that was issued by the commission as of August 15, 2013.
(2) Subdivision (a) shall apply to any limousine manufactured before 1970 if it was modified after August 15, 2013.
SEC. 2.
Section 34501 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
34501.
(a) (1) The department shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations that, in the judgment of the department, are designed to promote the safe operation of vehicles described in Section 34500, regarding, but not limited to, controlled substances and alcohol testing of drivers by motor carriers, hours of service of drivers, equipment, fuel containers, fueling operations, inspection, maintenance, recordkeeping, accident reports, and drawbridges. The rules and regulations shall not, however, be applicable to schoolbuses, which shall be subject to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 34501.5.
The rules and regulations shall exempt local law enforcement agencies, within a single county, engaged in the transportation of inmates or prisoners when those agencies maintain other motor vehicle operations records which furnish hours of service information on drivers which are in substantial compliance with the rules and regulations. This exemption does not apply to any local law enforcement agency engaged in the transportation of inmates or prisoners outside the county in which the agency is located, if that agency would otherwise be required, by existing law, to maintain driving logs.
(2) The department may adopt rules and regulations relating to commercial vehicle safety inspection and out-of-service criteria. In adopting the rules and regulations, the commissioner may consider the commercial vehicle safety inspection and out-of-service criteria adopted by organizations such as the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, other intergovernmental safety group, or the United States Department of Transportation. The commissioner may provide departmental representatives to that alliance or other organization for the purpose of promoting the continued improvement and refinement of compatible nationwide commercial vehicle safety inspection and out-of-service criteria.
(3) The commissioner shall appoint a committee of 15 members, consisting of representatives of industry subject to the regulations to be adopted pursuant to this section, to act in an advisory capacity to the department, and the department shall cooperate and confer with the advisory committee so appointed. The commissioner shall appoint a separate committee to advise the department on rules and regulations concerning wheelchair lifts for installation and use on buses, consisting of persons who use the wheelchair lifts, representatives of transit districts, representatives of designers or manufacturers of wheelchairs and wheelchair lifts, and representatives of the Department of Transportation.
(4) The department may inspect any vehicles in maintenance facilities or terminals, as well as any records relating to the dispatch of vehicles or drivers, and the pay of drivers, to ensure compliance with this code and regulations adopted pursuant to this section.
(b) The department, using the definitions adopted pursuant to Section 2402.7, shall adopt regulations for the transportation of hazardous materials in this state, except the transportation of materials which are subject to other provisions of this code, that the department determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the safety of persons and property using the highways. The regulations may include provisions governing the filling, marking, packing, labeling, and assembly of, and containers that may be used for, hazardous materials shipments, and the manner by which the shipper attests that the shipments are correctly identified and in proper condition for transport.
(c) (1) At least once every 13 months, the department shall inspect every maintenance facility or terminal of any person who at any time operates any bus. If the bus operation includes more than 100 buses, the inspection shall be without prior notice.
(2) This subdivision does not preclude the department from conducting inspections of tour bus operations with fewer than 100 buses without prior notice. To the extent possible, the department shall conduct inspections without prior notice of any tour bus operation, including tour bus operations that have a history of noncompliance with safety laws or regulations, that have received unsatisfactory ratings, or that have had buses ordered out of service for safety violations.
(3) If a tour bus operator receives an unsatisfactory rating, the department shall conduct a followup inspection between 30 and 90 days after the initial inspection during which the unsatisfactory rating was received.
(d) The commissioner shall adopt and enforce regulations which will make the public or private users of any bus aware of the operator’s last safety rating.
(e) It is unlawful and constitutes a misdemeanor for any person to operate any bus without the inspections specified in subdivision (c) having been conducted.
(f) The department may adopt regulations restricting or prohibiting the movement of any vehicle from a maintenance facility or terminal if the vehicle is found in violation of this code or regulations adopted pursuant to this section.
SEC. 3.
Section 34505.1 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
34505.1.
(a) Upon determining that a tour bus carrier or modified limousine carrier has either (1) failed to maintain any vehicle used in transportation for compensation in a safe operating condition or to comply with the Vehicle Code or with regulations contained in Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations relative to motor carrier safety, and, in the department’s opinion, that failure presents an imminent danger to public safety or constitutes such a consistent failure as to justify a recommendation to the Public Utilities Commission or the United States Department of Transportation or (2) failed to enroll all drivers in the pull notice system as required by Section 1808.1, the department shall recommend to the Public Utilities Commission that the carrier’s operating authority be suspended, denied, or revoked, or to the United States Department of Transportation that appropriate administrative action be taken against the carrier’s interstate operating authority, whichever is appropriate. For purposes of this subdivision, two consecutive unsatisfactory compliance ratings for an inspected terminal assigned because the tour bus carrier or modified limousine carrier failed to comply with the periodic report requirements of Section 1808.1 or the cancellation of the carrier’s enrollment by the Department of Motor Vehicles for nonpayment of required fees may be determined by the department to be a consistent failure. However, when recommending denial of an application for new or renewal authority, the department need not conclude that the carrier’s failure presents an imminent danger to public safety or that it constitutes a consistent failure. The department need only conclude that the carrier’s compliance with the safety-related matters described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) is sufficiently unsatisfactory to justify a recommendation for denial. The department shall retain a record, by carrier, of every recommendation made pursuant to this section.
(b) Before transmitting a recommendation pursuant to subdivision (a), the department shall notify the carrier in writing of all of the following:
(1) That the department has determined that the carrier’s safety record is unsatisfactory, furnishing a copy of any documentation or summary of any other evidence supporting the determination.
(2) That the determination may result in a suspension, revocation, or denial of the carrier’s operating authority by the Public Utilities Commission or the United States Department of Transportation, as appropriate.
(3) That the carrier may request a review of the determination by the department within five days of its receipt of the notice required under this subdivision. If a review is requested by the carrier, the department shall conduct and evaluate that review prior to transmitting any notification pursuant to subdivision (a).
(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) or (b), upon determining during a terminal inspection or at any other time that the condition of a tour bus is such that it has multiple safety violations of a nature that operation of the tour bus could constitute an imminent danger to public safety, the department shall immediately order the tour bus out of service. The tour bus shall not be subsequently operated with passengers until all of the safety violations have been corrected and the department has verified the correction of the safety violations upon a subsequent inspection by the department of the tour bus, which shall occur within five business days of the submission of a reinspection request from the tour bus carrier to the department.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law, on and after January 1, 2017, requires any person operating a modified limousine that is modified prior to July 1, 2015, to ensure that the vehicle is equipped with one or 2 rear windows that the rear seat passengers or all passengers of the vehicle may open from the inside of the vehicle in case of any fire or other emergency.
This bill would extend the operative date of this requirement to January 1, 2018.
(2) Existing law defines a tour bus to include any bus operated by or for a charter-party carrier of passengers or a passenger stage corporation, with a bus in this respect defined to mean any vehicle designed, used, or maintained for carrying more than 10 persons, including the driver. Existing law provides for the Department of the California Highway Patrol to regulate the safe operation of various classes of vehicles, including tour buses. A violation of various statutes and regulations governing tour buses and operators of tour buses is a crime.
Existing law also requires the department, at least once every 13 months, to inspect every maintenance facility or terminal of any person who at any time operates any bus. Existing law requires that if the bus operation includes more than 100 buses, the inspection shall be without prior notice.
This bill would require the department, if a tour bus has received an unsatisfactory compliance rating, to conduct a followup inspection between 30 and 90 days after the initial inspection during which the unsatisfactory rating was received. The bill would require the department to order a tour bus out of service upon determining during a terminal inspection or at any other time that the condition of a tour bus is such that it has multiple safety violations of a nature that operation of the tour bus could constitute an imminent danger to public safety. The bill would prohibit the tour bus from being operated with passengers until all of the safety violations have been corrected and the department has verified the correction of the safety violations upon a subsequent inspection by the department of the tour bus, which shall occur within five business days of the submission of a reinspection request from the tour bus carrier. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 27375, 34501, and 34505.1 of the Vehicle Code, relating to transportation."

(a) During periods described in subdivision (a) of Section 367, excessive water use is prohibited by a residential customer in a single-family residence or by a customer in a multiunit housing complex in which each unit is individually metered or submetered by the urban retail water supplier.
(b) Each urban retail water supplier shall establish a method to identify and discourage excessive water use, through one of the following options:
(1) Establishing a rate structure, subject to applicable constitutional and statutory limitations, that includes block tiers, water budgets, or rate surcharges over and above base rates for excessive water use by a residential water customer.
(2) (A) Establishing an excessive water use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition, or amending an existing ordinance, rule, or tariff condition, that includes a definition of or a procedure to identify and address excessive water use by metered single-family residential customers and customers in multiunit housing complexes in which each unit is individually metered or submetered and may include a process to issue written warnings to a customer and perform a site audit of customer water usage prior to deeming the customer in violation.
(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), excessive water use shall be measured in terms of either gallons or hundreds of cubic feet of water used during the urban retail water supplier’s regular billing cycle. In establishing the definition of excessive use, the urban retail water supplier may consider factors that include, but are not limited to, all of the following:
(i) Average daily use.
(ii) Full-time occupancy of households.
(iii) Amount of landscaped land on a property.
(iv) Rate of evapotranspiration.
(v) Seasonal weather changes.
(C) (i) A violation of an excessive use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition established pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall result in an infraction or administrative civil penalty. The penalty for a violation may be based on conditions identified by the urban retail water supplier and may include, but is not limited to, a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500) for each hundred cubic feet of water, or 748 gallons, used above the excessive water use threshold established by the urban retail water supplier in a billing cycle.
(ii) Any fine imposed pursuant to this subparagraph shall be added to the customer’s water bill and is due and payable with that water bill.
(iii) Each urban retail water supplier shall have a process for nonpayment of the fine, which shall be consistent with due process and reasonably similar to the water supplier’s existing process for nonpayment of a water bill.
(D) (i) Consistent with due process, an urban retail water supplier shall establish a process and conditions for the appeal of a fine imposed pursuant to subparagraph (C) whereby the customer may contest the imposition of the fine for excessive water use.
(ii) As part of the appeal process, the customer shall be provided with an opportunity to provide evidence that there was no excessive water use or of a bona fide reason for the excessive water use, including evidence of a water leak, a medical reason, or any other reasonable justification for the water use, as determined by the urban retail water supplier.
(iii) As part of the appeal process, the urban retail water supplier shall provide documentation demonstrating the excessive water usage.
(c) (1) The provisions of subdivision (b) do not apply to an urban retail water supplier that is not fully metered in accordance with Section 527. An urban retail water supplier shall comply with the provisions of subdivision (b) when all of the water supplier’s residential water service connections are being billed based on metered water usage.
(2) An urban retail water supplier that is not fully metered shall prohibit water use practices by an ordinance, resolution, rule, or tariff condition that imposes penalties for prohibited uses of water supplied by the water supplier. The urban retail water supplier may include a process to issue written warnings prior to imposing penalties as well as increased penalty amounts for successive violations.

(a) This chapter applies only as follows:
(1) During a period for which the Governor has issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8550) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) based on statewide drought conditions to an urban retail water supplier that has moved to a stage of action in response to a local water supply shortage condition under the water supplier’s contingency plan pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 10632 that requires mandatory water use reductions.
(2) To an urban retail water supplier during a period in which the water supplier has moved to a stage of action in response to a local water supply shortage condition under the water supplier’s contingency plan pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 10632 that requires mandatory water use reductions.
(3) To an urban retail water supplier affected during a period for which the Governor has issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8550) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) based on local drought conditions.
(b) The provisions of this chapter are in addition to, and do not supersede or limit, any other measures or remedies implemented by an urban retail water supplier.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The California Constitution declares the policy that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented, and that the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use of the waters in the interest of the people and for the public welfare. Existing law requires the Department of Water Resources and the State Water Resources Control Board to take all appropriate proceedings or actions to prevent waste, unreasonable use, unreasonable method of use, or unreasonable method of diversion of water in this state. Existing law authorizes any public entity, as defined, that supplies water at retail or wholesale for the benefit of persons within the service area or area of jurisdiction of the public entity to, by ordinance or resolution, adopt and enforce a water conservation program to reduce the quantity of water used for the purpose of conserving the water supplies of the public entity. Existing law provides that a violation of a requirement of a water conservation program is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 30 days, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both.
This bill would declare that during prescribed periods excessive water use by a residential customer in a single-family residence or by a customer in a multiunit housing complex, as specified, is prohibited. This bill, during prescribed periods, would require each urban retail water supplier to establish a method to identify and discourage excessive water use. This bill would authorize as a method to identify and discourage excessive water use the establishment of a rate structure that includes block tiers, water budgets, or rate surcharges over and above base rates for excessive water use by residential customers. This bill would authorize as a method to identify and discourage excessive water use the establishment of an excessive water use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition that includes a definition of or procedure to identify and address excessive water use, as prescribed, and would make a violation of this excessive water use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition an infraction or administrative civil penalty and would authorize the penalty for a violation to be based on conditions identified by the urban retail water supplier. By creating a new infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Chapter 3.3 (commencing with Section 365) to Division 1 of the Water Code, relating to water."
233,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
On or before January 1, 2018, the State Board of Equalization shall prepare a report analyzing the impact on the board and those making contributions to the board of lowering the monetary threshold that triggers the requirements of the Quentin L. Kopp Conflict of Interest Act of 1990 (Section 15626 of the Government Code) from two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) to one hundred dollars ($100).
SECTION 1.
Section 15626 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
15626.
(a)This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the Quentin L. Kopp Conflict of Interest Act of 1990.
(b)Prior to rendering any decision in any adjudicatory proceeding pending before the State Board of Equalization, each member who knows or has reason to know that he or she received a contribution or contributions within the preceding 12 months in an aggregate amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or more from a party or his or her agent, or from any participant or his or her agent, shall disclose that fact on the record of the proceeding.
(c)A member shall not make, participate in making, or in any way attempt to use his or her official position to influence, the decision in any adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board if the member knows or has reason to know that he or she received a contribution or contributions in an aggregate amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or more within the preceding 12 months from a party or his or her agent, or from any participant or his or her agent, and if the member knows or has reason to know that the participant has a financial interest in the decision, as that term is used in Article 1 (commencing with Section 87100) of Chapter 7 of Title 9.
(d)Notwithstanding subdivision (c), if a member receives a contribution which would otherwise require disqualification under subdivision (c), and he or she returns the contribution within 30 days from the time he or she knows, or has reason to know, about the contribution and the adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board, his or her participation in the proceeding shall be deemed lawful.
(e)A party to, or a participant in, an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board shall disclose on the record of the proceeding any contribution or contributions in an aggregate amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or more made within the preceding 12 months by the party or participant, or his or her agent, to any member of the board.
(f)When a close corporation is a party to, or a participant in, an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board, the majority shareholder is subject to the disclosure requirement specified in this section.
(g)For purposes of this section, if a deputy to the Controller sits at a meeting of the board and votes on behalf of the Controller, the deputy shall disclose contributions made to the Controller and shall disqualify himself or herself from voting pursuant to the requirements of this section.
(h)For purposes of this section:
(1)“Contribution” has the same meaning prescribed in Section 82015 and the regulations adopted pursuant to that section.
(2)“Party” means any person who is the subject of an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board.
(3)“Participant” means any person who is not a party but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board and who has a financial interest in the decision, as described in Article 1 (commencing with Section 87100) of Chapter 7 of Title 9. A person actively supports or opposes a particular decision if he or she lobbies in person the members or employees of the board, testifies in person before the board, or otherwise acts to influence the members of the board.
(4)“Agent” means any person who represents a party to or participant in an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board. If a person acting as an agent is also acting as an employee or member of a law, accounting, consulting, or other firm, or a similar entity or corporation, both the entity or corporation and the person are agents.
(5)“Adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board” means a matter for adjudication that has been scheduled and appears as an item on a meeting notice of the board as required by Section 11125 as a contested matter for administrative hearing before the board members. A consent calendar matter is not included unless the matter has previously appeared on the calendar as a nonconsent item, or has been removed from the consent calendar for separate discussion and vote, or the item is one about which the member has previously contacted the staff or a party.
(6)A member knows or has reason to know about a contribution if, after the adjudicatory proceeding first appears on a meeting notice of the board, facts have been brought to the member’s personal attention that he or she has received a contribution which would require disqualification under subdivision (c), or that the member received written notice from the board staff, before commencement of the hearing and before any subsequent decision on the matter, that a specific party, close corporation, or majority shareholder, or agent thereof, or any participant having a financial interest in the matter, or agent thereof, in a specific, named adjudicatory proceeding before the board, made a contribution or contributions within the preceding 12 months in an aggregate amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or more. Each member shall provide board staff with a copy of each of his or her campaign statements at the time each of those statements is filed.
The notice of contribution shall be on a form prescribed under rules adopted by the board to provide for staff inquiry of each party, participant, close corporation, and its majority shareholder, and any agent thereof, to determine whether any contribution has been made to a member, and if so, in what aggregate amount and on what date or dates within the 12 months preceding an adjudicatory proceeding or decision.
In addition, the staff shall inquire and report on the record as follows:
(A)Whether any party or participant is a close corporation, and if so, the name of its majority shareholder.
(B)Whether any agent is an employee or member of any law, accounting, consulting, or other firm, or similar entity or corporation, and if so, its name and address and whether a contribution has been made by any such person, firm, corporation, or entity.
(i)(1)Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(2)No person convicted of a misdemeanor under this section shall be a candidate for any elective office or act as a lobbyist for a period for four years following the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired, or all possibility of direct attack in the courts of this state has been finally exhausted, unless the court at the time of sentencing specifically determines that this provision shall not be applicable. A plea of nolo contendere shall be deemed a conviction for the purposes of this section.
(3)In addition to other penalties provided by law, a fine of up to the greater of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or three times the amount the person failed to disclose or report properly, may be imposed upon conviction for each violation.
(4)Prosecution for violation of this section shall be commenced within four years after the date on which the violation occurred.
(5)This section shall not prevent any member of the board from making, or participating in making, a governmental decision to the extent that the member’s participation is legally required for the action or decision to be made. However, the fact that a member’s vote is needed to break a tie does not make the member’s participation legally required.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Quentin L. Kopp Conflict of Interest Act of 1990 requires a member of the State Board of Equalization who has received a contribution or contributions within the preceding 12 months in an aggregate amount of $250 or more from a party or his or her agent, or from any participant or his or her agent, to, prior to rendering any decision in any adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board, disclose that fact on the record of the proceeding. A member is prohibited from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence, the decision in an adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board if the member knows or has reason to know that he or she received a contribution or contributions
within the preceding 12 months
in an aggregate amount of $250 or more from a party
to the proceeding,
or his or her agent,
or from a participant
in the proceeding
or his or her agent, and
the member knows or has reason to know
that the participant
has a financial interest in the decision.

A person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of the act is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would reduce the $250 contribution limitation to $100, applying the above-described disclosure and disqualification provisions if a board member receives a contribution in the amount of $100, or more from a party, agent, or participant, as provided.
By extending the application of the criminal sanctions of the Quentin L. Kopp Conflict of Interest Act of 1990, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

relating to the State Board of Equalization."
234,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 236.14 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
236.14.
(a) If a person was arrested for or convicted of any nonviolent offense committed while he or she was a victim of human trafficking, including, but not limited to, prostitution as described in subdivision (b) of Section 647, the person may petition the court for vacatur relief of his or her convictions and arrests under th"">(e) The court may, with the agreement of the petitioner and all of the involved state or local prosecutorial agencies, consolidate into one hearing a petition with multiple convictions from different jurisdictions.

(1) Testimony by the petitioner, which may be required in support of the petition.
(2) Evidence and supporting documentation in support of the petition.
(3) Opposition evidence presented by any of the involved state or local prosecutorial agencies that obtained the conviction.
(g) After considering the totality of the evidence presented, the court may vacate the conviction and expunge the arrests and issue an order if it finds all of the following:
(1) That the petitioner was a victim of human trafficking at the time the nonviolent crime was committed.
(2) The commission of the crime was a direct result of being a victim of human trafficking.
(3) The victim is engaged in a good faith effort to distance himself or herself from the human trafficking scheme.
(4) It is in the best interest of the petitioner and in the interests of justice.
(h) In issuing an order of vacatur for the convictions, an order shall do the following:
(1) Set forth a finding that the petitioner was a victim of human trafficking when he or she committed the offense.
(2) Set aside the verdict of guilty or the adjudication and dismiss the accusation or information against the petitioner.
(3) Notify the Department of Justice that the petitioner was a victim of human trafficking when he or she committed the crime and of the relief that has been ordered.
(i) Notwithstanding this section, a petitioner shall not be relieved of any financial restitution order that directly benefits the victim of a nonviolent crime, unless it has already been paid.
(j) A person who was arrested as, or found to be, a person described in Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code because he or she committed a nonviolent offense while he or she was a victim of human trafficking, including, but not limited to, prostitution, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 647, may petition the court for relief under this section. If the petitioner establishes that the arrest or adjudication was the direct result of being a victim of human trafficking the petitioner is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the requirements for relief have been met.
(k) If the court issues an order as described in subdivision (a) or (j), the court shall also order the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the offense, the Department of Justice, and any law enforcement agency that arrested the petitioner or participated in the arrest of the petitioner to seal their records of the arrest and the court order to seal and destroy the records for three years from the date of the arrest, or within one year after the court order is granted, whichever occurs later, and thereafter to destroy their records of the arrest and the court order to seal and destroy those records. The court shall provide the petitioner a copy of any court order concerning the destruction of the arrest records.
(l) A petition pursuant to this section shall be made and heard within a reasonable time after the person has ceased to be a victim of human trafficking, or within a reasonable time after the petitioner has sought services for being a victim of human trafficking, whichever occurs later, subject to reasonable concerns for the safety of the petitioner, family members of the petitioner, or other victims of human trafficking who may be jeopardized by the bringing of the application or for other reasons consistent with the purposes of this section.
(m) For the purposes of this section, official documentation of a petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking may be introduced as evidence that his or her participation in the offense was the result of his or her status as a victim of human trafficking. For the purposes of this subdivision, “official documentation” means any documentation issued by a federal, state, or local agency that tends to show the petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking. Official documentation shall not be required for the issuance of an order described in subdivision (a).
(n) A petitioner, or his or her attorney, may be excused from appearing in person at a hearing for relief pursuant to this section only if the court finds a compelling reason why the petitioner cannot attend the hearing, in which case the petitioner may appear telephonically, via videoconference, or by other electronic means established by the court.
(o) Notwithstanding any other law, a petitioner who has obtained an order pursuant to this section may lawfully deny or refuse to acknowledge an arrest, conviction, or adjudication that is set aside pursuant to the order.

(3) “Victim of human trafficking” means the victim of a crime described in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of Section 236.1.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 236.14 to the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the privacy of victims of human trafficking and to improve their opportunities for recovery, it is necessary that this act limit the public’s right of access to the full name of a petitioner who seeks relief from an arrest or conviction for an offense in which the petitioner participated as a result of his or her status as a victim of human trafficking.","Existing law defines and proscribes the crimes of human trafficking, solicitation, and prostitution. Existing law provides that if a defendant has been convicted of solicitation or prostitution and has completed any term of probation for that conviction, the defendant may petition the court for relief if the defendant can establish by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction was the result of his or her status as a victim of human trafficking. Existing law authorizes a court to issue an order that (1) sets forth a finding that the defendant was a victim of human trafficking, as specified, (2) dismisses the accusation or information against the defendant, or orders other relief, and (3) notifies the Department of Justice that the defendant was a victim of human trafficking when he or she committed the crime and the relief that has been ordered.
Existing law authorizes a person who was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court for solicitation or prostitution to, upon reaching 18 years of age, petition the court to have his or her record sealed, as specified.
This bill would establish a separate petition process for a person who has been arrested for, convicted of, or adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court for, committing a nonviolent offense, as defined, while he or she was a victim of human trafficking. The bill would require the petitioner to establish that the arrest, conviction, or adjudication was the direct result of being a victim of human trafficking in order to obtain relief. The bill would require the petition for relief to be submitted under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the scope of a crime. The bill would authorize the court, upon making specified findings, to vacate the conviction or adjudication and issue an order that provides the relief described above and also provides for the sealing and destruction of the petitioner’s arrest and court records, as specified. The bill would require that the petition be made within a reasonable time after the person has ceased to be a victim of human trafficking, or within a reasonable time after the person has sought services for being a victim of human trafficking, whichever is later. The bill would provide that official documentation, as defined, of a petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking may be introduced as evidence that his or her participation in the offense was the result of the petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking. The bill would provide that a petitioner or his or her attorney is not required to appear in person at a hearing for the relief described above if the court finds a compelling reason why the petitioner cannot attend the hearing and may appear via alternate specified methods. The bill would prohibit the disclosure of the full name of a petitioner in the record of a proceeding related to his or her petition that is accessible by the public. The bill would authorize a petitioner who has obtained the relief described above to lawfully deny or refuse to acknowledge an arrest, conviction, or adjudication that is set aside pursuant to that relief. By expanding the scope of a crime and increasing the number of records local agencies would be required to seal and destroy, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Section 236.14 to the Penal Code, relating to human trafficking."

(b) Funding for the program is continuously appropriated pursuant to Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established pursuant to Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.
(c) Funding shall be allocated by the Controller on a formula basis consistent with the requirements of this part and with Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code, upon a determination by the Department of Transportation that the expenditures proposed by a recipient transit agency meet the requirements of this part and guidelines developed pursuant to this section, and that the amount of funding requested is currently available.
(d) A recipient transit agency shall demonstrate that each expenditure of program moneys allocated to the agency reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
(e) A recipient transit agency shall demonstrate that each expenditure of program moneys does not supplant another source of funds.
(f) Moneys for the program shall be expended to provide transit operating or capital assistance that meets any of the following:
(1) Expenditures that directly enhance or expand transit service by supporting new or expanded bus or rail services, new or expanded water-borne transit, or expanded intermodal transit facilities, and may include equipment acquisition, fueling, and maintenance, and other costs to operate those services or facilities.
(2) Operational expenditures that increase transit mode share.
(3) Expenditures related to the purchase of zero-emission buses, including electric buses, and the installation of the necessary equipment and infrastructure to operate and support these zero-emission buses.

(h) The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, shall develop guidelines that describe the methodologies that recipient transit agencies shall use to demonstrate that proposed expenditures will meet the criteria in subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (g) and establish the reporting requirements for documenting ongoing compliance with those criteria.
(i) Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code does not apply to the development of guidelines for the program pursuant to this section.
(j) A recipient transit agency shall submit the following information to the Department of Transportation before seeking a disbursement of funds pursuant to this part:
(1) A list of proposed expense types for anticipated funding levels.
(2) The documentation required by the guidelines developed pursuant to this section to demonstrate compliance with subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (g).
(k) For capital projects, the recipient transit agency shall also do all of the following:
(1) Specify the phases of work for which the agency is seeking an allocation of moneys from the program.
(2) Identify the sources and timing of all moneys required to undertake and complete any phase of a project for which the recipient agency is seeking an allocation of moneys from the program.
(3) Describe intended sources and timing of funding to complete any subsequent phases of the project, through construction or procurement.
(l) A recipient transit agency that has used program moneys for any type of operational assistance allowed by subdivision (f) in a previous fiscal year may use program moneys to continue the same service or program in any subsequent fiscal year if the agency can demonstrate that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be realized.
(m) Before authorizing the disbursement of funds, the Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, shall determine the eligibility, in whole or in part, of the proposed list of expense types, based on the documentation provided by the recipient transit agency to ensure ongoing compliance with the guidelines developed pursuant to this section.
(n) The Department of Transportation shall notify the Controller of approved expenditures for each recipient transit agency, and the amount of the allocation for each agency determined to be available at that time of approval.
(o) A recipient transit agency that does not submit an expenditure for funding in a particular fiscal year may retain its funding share, and may accumulate and utilize that funding share in a subsequent fiscal year for a larger expenditure, including operating assistance. The recipient transit agency must first specify the number of fiscal years that it intends to retain its funding share and the expenditure for which the agency intends to use these moneys. A recipient transit agency may only retain its funding share for a maximum of four years.
(p) A recipient transit agency may, in any particular fiscal year, loan or transfer its funding share to another recipient transit agency within the same region for any identified eligible expenditure under the program, including operating assistance, in accordance with procedures incorporated by the Department of Transportation in the guidelines developed pursuant to this section, which procedures shall be consistent with the requirement in subdivision (g).
(q) A recipient transit agency may apply to the Department of Transportation to reassign any savings of surplus moneys allocated under this section to the agency for an expenditure that has been completed to another eligible expenditure under the program, including operating assistance. A recipient transit agency may also apply to the Department of Transportation to reassign to another eligible expenditure any moneys from the program previously allocated to the agency for an expenditure that the agency has determined is no longer a priority for the use of those moneys.
(r) The recipient transit agency shall provide annual reports to the Department of Transportation, in the format and manner prescribed by the department, consistent with the internal administrative procedures for the use of the fund proceeds developed by the State Air Resources Board.
(s) The Department of Transportation and recipient transit agencies shall comply with the guidelines developed by the State Air Resources Board pursuant to Section 39715 of the Health and Safety Code to ensure that the requirements of Section 39713 of the Health and Safety Code are met to maximize the benefits to disadvantaged communities as described in Section 39711 of the Health and Safety Code.
(t) A recipient transit agency shall comply with all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000)), and civil rights and environmental justice obligations under state and federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to expand or extend the applicability of those laws to recipient transit agencies.
(u) The audit of public transportation operator finances already required under the Transportation Development Act pursuant to Section 99245 of the Public Utilities Code shall be expanded to include verification of receipt and appropriate expenditure of moneys from the program. Each recipient transit agency receiving moneys from the program in a fiscal year for which an audit is conducted shall transmit a copy of the audit to the Department of Transportation, and the department shall make the audits available to the Legislature and the Controller for review on request.
SEC. 2.
Section 75231 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
75231.
(a) A recipient transit agency under the program created pursuant to Section 75230 may apply to the Department of Transportation for a letter of no prejudice for any eligible expenditures under the program, including operating assistance, for which the department has authorized a disbursement of funds. If approved by the department, the letter of no prejudice shall allow the recipient transit agency to expend its own moneys for the expenditures and to be eligible for future reimbursement from moneys available for the program.
(b) The amount expended under subdivision (a) shall be reimbursed by the state from moneys available for the program if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The expenditures for which the letter of no prejudice was requested have commenced, and any regional or local expenditures, if applicable, have been incurred.
(2) The expenditures made by the recipient transit agency are eligible under the program. If expenditures made by the recipient transit agency are determined to be ineligible, the state has no obligation to reimburse those expenditures.
(3) The recipient transit agency complies with all applicable legal requirements for the expenditures, including the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000)), and civil rights and environmental justice obligations under state and federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to expand or extend the applicability of those laws to recipient transit agencies.
(4) There are moneys in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund designated for the program and from the recipient transit agency’s formula allocation share as determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code that are sufficient to make the reimbursement payment.
(c) The recipient transit agency and the Department of Transportation shall enter into an agreement governing reimbursement as described in this section. The timing and final amount of reimbursement shall be dependent on the terms of the agreement and the availability of moneys in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the program.
(d) The Department of Transportation, in consultation with recipient public transit agencies, may develop guidelines to implement this section.","Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to various programs, including 5% for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, for expenditures to provide transit operating or capital assistance consistent with specified criteria. Existing law provides for distribution of available funds under the program by a specified formula to recipient transit agencies by the Controller, upon approval of the recipient transit agency’s proposed expenditures by the Department of Transportation.
This bill would require a recipient transit agency to demonstrate that each expenditure of program moneys allocated to the agency does not supplant another source of funds. The bill would authorize a recipient transit agency that does not submit an expenditure for funding under the program in a particular fiscal year to retain its funding share for expenditure in a subsequent fiscal year for a maximum of 4 years. The bill would allow a recipient transit agency to loan or transfer its funding share in any particular fiscal year to another recipient transit agency within the same region, or to apply to the department to reassign, to other eligible expenditures under the program, any savings of surplus moneys from an approved and completed expenditure under the program or from an approved expenditure that is no longer a priority, as specified. The bill would also allow a recipient transit agency to apply to the department for a letter of no prejudice for any eligible expenditures under the program for which the department has authorized a disbursement of funds, and, if granted, would allow the recipient transit agency to expend its own moneys and to be eligible for future reimbursement from the program, under specified conditions. The bill would also require a recipient transit agency to provide additional information to the department to the extent funding is sought for capital projects.","An act to amend Section 75230 of, and to add Section 75231 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to transportation."

Existing law requires the surcharge to be deposited into the General Fund and provides that it may be appropriated in support of the board in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code.

237,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Chapter 3.132 (commencing with Section 15820.94) is added to Part 10b of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
CHAPTER  3.132. Financing of Adult Local Criminal Justice Facilities - 2016
15820.94.
(a) For purposes of this chapter, “participating county” means a county, city and county, or regional consortium of counties, within the state that has been certified to the State Public Works Board (board) by the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) as having satisfied all of the requirements set forth in this chapter for financing an adult local criminal justice facility pursuant to this chapter.
(b) (1) For purposes of this chapter, an adult local criminal justice facility may include improved housing with an emphasis on expanding program and treatment space as necessary to manage the adult offender population under the jurisdiction of the sheriff or county department of corrections, as may be applicable, consistent with the legislative intent described in Sections 17.5 and 3450 of the Penal Code, to be further defined by the BSCC in duly adopted regulations.
(2) For purposes of this chapter, an adult local criminal justice facility may also include custodial housing, reentry, program, mental health, or treatment space necessary to manage the adult offender population under the jurisdiction of the sheriff or county department of corrections, as may be applicable, consistent with the legislative intent described in Sections 17.5 and 3450 of the Penal Code, to be further defined by the BSCC in duly adopted regulations.
15820.940.
(a) The BSCC or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), a participating county, and the board are authorized to acquire, design, and construct an adult local criminal justice facility approved by the BSCC pursuant to Section 15820.945, or to acquire a site or sites owned by, or subject to a lease or option to purchase held by, a participating county. For the purposes of this chapter, acquisition shall include, but is not limited to, acquisition of completed facilities through a build-to-suit purchase. Facilities financed pursuant to this chapter may be delivered through either a design-bid-build or a design-build process. The ownership interest of a participating county in the site or sites for an adult local criminal justice facility shall be determined by the board to be adequate for purposes of its financing in order to be eligible under this chapter.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 14951, the participating county may assign an inspector during the construction of the adult local criminal justice facility.
(c) The BSCC or the CDCR, a participating county, and the board shall enter into an agreement for each adult local criminal justice facility that shall provide, at a minimum, performance expectations of the parties related to the acquisition, design, and construction, including, without limitation, renovation, of the adult local criminal justice facility; guidelines and criteria for use and application of the proceeds of revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes issued by the board to pay for the cost of the approved adult local criminal justice facility; and ongoing maintenance and staffing responsibilities for the term of the financing.
(d) The agreement shall include a provision that the participating county agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the State of California for any and all claims and losses arising out of the acquisition, design, and construction of the adult local criminal justice facility. The agreement may also contain additional terms and conditions that facilitate the financing by the board.
(e) The scope and cost of the adult local criminal justice facilities shall be subject to approval and administrative oversight by the board.
(f) For purposes of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code), the board, BSCC, and the CDCR are not a lead or responsible agency; the participating county is the lead agency.
15820.941.
Upon a participating county’s receipt of responsive construction bids or design-build proposals, or a participating county’s notification to the board of its intent to exercise a purchase option, and after the adult local criminal justice facility has been certified pursuant to Section 15820.94, the board and the BSCC or the CDCR may borrow funds for project costs from the Pooled Money Investment Account pursuant to Sections 16312 and 16313, or from any other appropriate source. In the event any of the revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes authorized by this chapter are not sold, the BSCC or the CDCR shall commit a sufficient amount of its support appropriation to repay any loans made for an approved adult local criminal justice facility.
15820.942.
(a) The board may issue up to two hundred seventy million dollars ($270,000,000) in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes, pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 15830), to finance the acquisition, design, and construction, including, without limitation, renovation, and a reasonable construction reserve, of approved adult local criminal justice facilities described in Section 15820.940, and any additional amount authorized under Section 15849.6 to pay for the cost of financing.
(b) Proceeds from the revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes may be used to reimburse a participating county for the costs of acquisition, design, and construction, including, without limitation, renovation, for approved adult local criminal justice facilities.
(c) Notwithstanding Section 13340, funds derived pursuant to this section and Section 15820.941 are continuously appropriated for purposes of this chapter.
15820.943.
In support of this state financing, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California’s current challenges in managing jail populations follow decades of overcrowded and aging jails, and piecemeal, erratic, and incomplete responses to dealing with these problems. Reversing course will require sustainable solutions that must include sound planning and implementation, and must be grounded in the principle that jail resources must be well-planned and employed efficiently and effectively to prevent overcrowding and promote public safety through the broader use of evidence-based practices and policies in the criminal justice system.
(b) California needs a long-term, statewide strategy to effectively manage its jail population and jail resources. Without an ongoing analytical framework for taking into account factors such as population growth, criminogenic needs of the current and future jail populations, crime rates, custodial housing needs, and additional changes to realignment or sentencing laws and practices, California will continue to resort to reactive, fragmentary fixes to its jail condition and capacity problems instead of being fully prepared to develop an effective and sustainable system of local custodial facilities.
(c) The county adult criminal justice system needs improved housing with an emphasis on expanding program and treatment space to manage the adult offender population under its jurisdiction.
(d) Improved county adult criminal justice housing with an emphasis on expanding program and treatment space will enhance public safety throughout the state by providing increased access to appropriate programs or treatment.
(e) By improving county adult criminal justice housing with an emphasis on expanding program and treatment space, this financing will serve a critical state purpose by promoting public safety.
(f) This purpose represents valuable consideration in exchange for this state action.
15820.944.
With the consent of the board, the BSCC or the CDCR and a participating county are authorized to enter into leases or subleases, as lessor or lessee, for any property or approved adult local criminal justice facility and are further authorized to enter into contracts or other agreements for the use, maintenance, and operation of the adult local criminal justice facility in order to facilitate the financing authorized by this chapter. In those leases, subleases, or other agreements, the participating county shall agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the State of California for any and all claims and losses accruing and resulting from or arising out of the participating county’s use and occupancy of the adult local criminal justice facility.
15820.945.
(a) The BSCC shall adhere to its duly adopted regulations for the approval or disapproval of adult local criminal justice facilities. The BSCC shall also consider cost effectiveness in determining approval or disapproval. No state moneys shall be encumbered in contracts let by a participating county until one of the following occurs:
(1) Final architectural plans and specifications have been approved by the BSCC, and subsequent construction bids have been received.

(A) Fifty-eight percent of the balance of the fund shall be distributed to physicians and surgeons for emergency services provided by all physicians and surgeons, except those physicians and surgeons employed by county hospitals, in general acute care hospitals that provide basic, comprehensive, or standby emergency services pursuant to paragraph (3) or (5) of subdivision (f) of Section 1797.98e up to the time the patient is stabilized.
(B) Twenty-five percent of the fund shall be distributed only to hospitals providing disproportionate trauma and emergency medical care services.
(C) Seventeen percent of the fund shall be distributed for other emergency medical services purposes as determined by each county, including, but not limited to, the funding of regional poison control centers. Funding may be used for purchasing equipment and for capital projects only to the extent that these expenditures support the provision of emergency services and are consistent with the intent of this chapter.
(c) The source of the moneys in the fund shall be the penalty assessment made for this purpose, as provided in Section 76000 of the Government Code.
(d) Any physician and surgeon may be reimbursed for up to 50 percent of the amount claimed pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1797.98c for the initial cycle of reimbursements made by the administering agency in a given year, pursuant to Section 1797.98e. All funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year in excess of any reserve held and rolled over to the next year pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) shall be distributed proportionally, based on the dollar amount of claims submitted and paid to all physicians and surgeons who submitted qualifying claims during that year.
(e) Of the money deposited into the fund pursuant to Section 76000.5 of the Government Code, 15 percent shall be utilized to provide funding for all pediatric trauma centers throughout the county, both publicly and privately owned and operated. The expenditure of money shall be limited to reimbursement to physicians and surgeons, and to hospitals for patients who do not make payment for emergency care services in hospitals up to the point of stabilization, or to hospitals for expanding the services provided to pediatric trauma patients at trauma centers and other hospitals providing care to pediatric trauma patients, or at pediatric trauma centers, including the purchase of equipment. Local emergency medical services (EMS) agencies may conduct a needs assessment of pediatric trauma services in the county to allocate these expenditures. Counties that do not maintain a pediatric trauma center shall utilize the money deposited into the fund pursuant to Section 76000.5 of the Government Code to improve access to, and coordination of, pediatric trauma and emergency services in the county, with preference for funding given to hospitals that specialize in services to children, and physicians and surgeons who provide emergency care for children. Funds spent for the purposes of this section shall be known as Richie’s Fund. This subdivision shall remain in effect until January 1, 2027.
(f) Costs of administering money deposited into the fund pursuant to Section 76000.5 of the Government Code shall be reimbursed from the money collected in an amount that does not exceed the actual administrative costs or 10 percent of the money collected, whichever amount is lower. This subdivision shall remain in effect until January 1, 2027.","Existing law establishes the Maddy Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Fund, and authorizes each county to establish an emergency medical services fund for reimbursement of costs related to emergency medical services. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes county boards of supervisors to elect to levy an additional penalty, for deposit into the EMS Fund, in the amount of $2 for every $10 upon fines, penalties, and forfeitures collected for criminal offenses. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, requires 15% of the funds collected pursuant to that provision to be used to provide funding for pediatric trauma centers.
This bill would extend the operative date of these provisions until January 1, 2027.","An act to amend Section 76000.5 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 1797.98a of the Health and Safety Code, relating to emergency medical services."

243,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s report to Congress, 115,738 people were estimated to be homeless in California in 2014, a rate that is unprecedented following a deep and prolonged economic recession, a severe shortage of safe and affordable housing, a failed veteran and civilian mental health system, and a diminished social safety net.
(b) According to the United States Department of Education, 284,086 schoolchildren were known to have experienced homelessness in the 2013–14 school year.
(c) Homelessness is an independent risk factor for a number of illnesses, making people more susceptible to increased health problems due to high stress, sleep deprivation, unsanitary surroundings, lack of access to hygiene facilities, and a myriad of other situational stressors experienced by people without stable housing. Subsequently, people who are chronically homeless are more medically frail and three to four times more likely to die prematurely than their housed counterparts.
(d) Throughout California, local governments have enacted ordinances that make it illegal to rest or receive nourishment in public spaces.
(e) Ending homelessness in California will require significant state and federal resources and there is ample evidence that policies that invest in ending homelessness, rather than criminalizing and marginalizing people who are experiencing homelessness, adequately balance the needs of all parties: community residents, government agencies, businesses, and men and women who are experiencing homelessness.
(f) Passing this act will not reduce homelessness, but neither will local ordinances that criminalize homelessness. Instead, ordinances that criminalize homelessness result in increased incarceration rates and financial indebtedness of people who simply have no means of support and prolong homelessness by making it more difficult for people to secure housing, employment, and medical care. Criminalization policies further marginalize men and women who are experiencing homelessness, fuel inflammatory attitudes, and may even unduly restrict constitutionally protected liberties.
(g) That is why, on September 18, 2015, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development included in the annual Notice of Funding Availability for the 2015 Continuum of Care Program
funding competition,
Competition
provisions that would award additional points to any application that could include steps the community is taking to reduce criminalization of homelessness.
(h) It is also why, on August 6, 2015, the United States Department of Justice submitted a rare statement of interest in a United States District Court in opposition to the criminalization of people who are homeless, calling it cruel and unusual punishment to punish someone for a crime with the potential for imprisonment and a violation of constitutional rights.
(i) While these ordinances apply to all residents, they disproportionately impact people without homes, who have no private place to rest or seek nourishment, and are often selectively applied by law enforcement to people based upon their appearance or an assumption of homelessness.
(j) In practice, these ordinances deprive persons experiencing homelessness and those who may be perceived as homeless of a safe and legal place to rest and seek nourishment, which adversely impacts their health and well-being.
(k) Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive processes and puts one at risk for obesity, heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, and depression. People who are homeless suffer from sleep deprivation and, absent a place to rest, they suffer it more frequently.
(l) Because current practices have denied the right to adequate legal representation to people cited or arrested while resting or sharing food, homeless persons are often denied relief or damages through the courts.
(m) Both the federal government, through its Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the United Nations have recognized that discrimination and criminalization violate a homeless person’s human rights and have called upon state and local governments to cease enactment and enforcement of those laws.
(n) Homelessness and the increasing criminalization of homelessness and discrimination against those experiencing homelessness are widespread throughout California and are matters of statewide concern.
(o) Section 1 of Article I of the California Constitution provides that “[a]ll people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy,” without qualification as to whether or not a person is, or appears to be, homeless.
(p) Subdivision (a) of Section 7 of Article I of the California Constitution provides that “[a] person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws ... .”
(q) Concordant with this fundamental belief, a person should not be subject to discrimination based on his or her income, housing status, or ability or desire to appear housed. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this legislation to protect the rights of all Californians, regardless of their housing status, and ameliorate the adverse effects caused by the criminalization of homelessness on our communities and our citizens.
(r) Decriminalization of rest allows municipal governments to redirect resources from local enforcement activities to activities that address the root causes of homelessness and poverty.

any property
upon which there is an easement for public use and that is held open to the public, including, but not limited to, plazas, courtyards, parking lots, sidewalks, public transportation facilities and services, public buildings, shopping centers, and parks.
The ability to rest shall not apply to a public space during a time it is closed to all persons or when a fee is required for entry or use.
(c) “Rest” means the state of not moving, holding certain postures that include, but are not limited to, sitting, standing, leaning, kneeling, squatting, sleeping, or lying.
53.81.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that this section be interpreted broadly so as to prohibit policies or practices that are discriminatory in either their purpose or effect.
(b) Persons experiencing homelessness shall be permitted to use public space in the ways described in this section at any time that the public space is open to the public without discrimination based upon their housing status, and without being subject to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties.

Section 11139.2 is added to the Government Code, to read:
11139.2.
To improve monitoring of discrimination based upon housing status and violations of Part 2.2 (commencing with Section 53.8) of Division 1 of the Civil Code, and to ensure that people who are experiencing homelessness are not unlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of state-funded programs or assistance, or unlawfully subjected to discrimination, all applicants for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Program shall annually provide to the Department of Housing and Community Development’s Division of Housing Policy Development a copy of its application for funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that includes the organization’s response to the application question regarding steps that its community is taking to reduce criminalization of homelessness.
Notwithstanding Section 10231.5, the Department of Housing and Community Development shall compile the information regarding community actions to reduce criminalization of homelessness found in those applications and provide an annual report to the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee and the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee.
SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides that no person shall, on the basis of race, national origin, ethnic group identification, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, color, genetic information, or disability, be unlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by any state agency, is funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the state.
This bill would afford persons experiencing homelessness the right to use public spaces without discrimination based on their housing status and describe basic human and civil rights that may be exercised without being subject to criminal or civil sanctions, including the right to use and to move freely in public spaces, the right to rest in public spaces and to protect oneself from the elements, the right to eat in any public space in which having food is not prohibited, and the right to perform religious observances in public spaces, as specified. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that these provisions be interpreted broadly so as to prohibit policies or practices that are discriminatory in either their purpose or effect.
The bill would authorize a person whose rights have been violated pursuant to these provisions to enforce those rights in a civil action in which the court may award the prevailing plaintiff injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, damages, statutory damages of $1,000 per violation, and fees and costs.
The bill would also require all applicants for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Program to annually provide to the Department of Housing and Community Development’s Division of Housing Policy Development a copy of its application for funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that includes the organization’s response to the application question regarding steps that its community is taking to reduce criminalization of homelessness. Because the bill would require local agencies to perform additional duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the Department of Housing and Community Development to compile the information regarding community actions to reduce criminalization of homelessness found in those applications and provide a report to the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee and the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Part 2.2 (commencing with Section 53.8) to Division 1 of the Civil Code, and to add Section 11139.2 to, the Government Code, relating to homelessness."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Information and data regarding violent deaths can help provide states and communities with a clearer understanding of violent deaths and therefore lead to better prevention of violent deaths.
(b) According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, violence accounts for approximately 56,000 deaths annually. Violent deaths result from the intentional use of physical force or power against oneself, another person, or a group or community, and include suicide, homicide, and legal intervention deaths. Violence adversely affects all Americans, not only through premature death, but also through medical costs and lost productivity.
(c) The CDC further notes that the cost of these deaths totaled $47.2 billion: $47 billion in work loss costs and $215 million in medical treatment.
(d) In 2002, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) was established as a surveillance system that pulls together data on violent deaths. NVDRS collects information from death certificates, coroner or medical examiner reports, police reports, and crime laboratories.
(e) NVDRS data inform decisionmakers and program planners about the magnitude, trends, and characteristics of violent deaths in a particular state or community so appropriate prevention efforts can be identified and implemented, and the data facilitate the evaluation of state-based prevention programs and strategies.
(f) According to NVDRS, a national system will allow the CDC to provide information for every state to inform their prevention efforts. It will also ensure enhanced information on the national scope of the problem of violent deaths is available to monitor and track trends and to inform national efforts.

(4) A local agency entering into an agreement pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) shall collect data based on existing or new data elements required by the California Electronic Violent Death Reporting System only to the extent that resources are made available.
(d) To the extent that funding is available for this purpose, a law enforcement agency may report to the department data on the circumstances surrounding all violent deaths from investigative reports and, if available, laboratory toxicology reports to be used by the department for the limited purpose of conducting public health surveillance and epidemiology. Aggregate data shall be public, but individual identifying information shall remain confidential. The collected data shall be based on the data elements of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System.
(e) The department may apply for grants provided under the National Violent Death Reporting System for purposes of implementing this section.
(f) The department may accept private or foundation moneys to implement this section.
(g) This section does not limit data sources that the department may collect, which may include any public agency document that may contain data on violent deaths.

For purposes of this article, “violent death” means a death resulting from the use of physical force or power against oneself, another person, or a group or community, and includes, but is not limited to, homicide, suicide, legal intervention deaths, unintentional firearm deaths, and undetermined intent deaths.","Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health, which is responsible for various programs relating to the health and safety of people in the state, including licensing health facilities, regulating food and drug safety, and monitoring and preventing communicable and chronic diseases.
This bill would, to the extent that funding is appropriated by the Legislature or available through private funds in each fiscal year, require the department to establish and maintain the California Electronic Violent Death Reporting System. The bill would further require the department to collect data on violent deaths, as specified, and to post on the department’s Internet Web site a summary and analysis of the collected data. The bill would authorize the department to enter into a contract, grant, or other agreement with a local agency to collect certain data, within the agency’s own jurisdiction or through other local agencies, as specified, and would authorize the department to apply for grants to implement these provisions. The bill would, to the extent that funding is available for this purpose, authorize a law enforcement agency to report to the department data on the circumstances surrounding all violent deaths from investigative reports and laboratory toxicology reports to be used by the department for the limited purpose of conducting public health surveillance and epidemiology.

(b)“Railroad corporation” means a corporation or receiver operating a railroad.

Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to investigate employee complaints and to conduct a hearing in any action to recover wages, penalties, and other demands for compensation.
This bill would require an employer, which includes a grocery store establishment, restaurant, or retail store establishment, to provide its employees with a work schedule at least 7 calendar days prior to the first shift on that work schedule, except as specified.

600 of

246,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California is experiencing an extreme housing shortage with 2.2 million extremely low income and very low income renter households competing for only 664,000 affordable rental homes. This leaves more than 1.54 million of California’s lowest income households without access to affordable housing.
(b) While homelessness across the United States is in an overall decline, homelessness in California is rising. In 2015, California had 115,738 homeless people, which accounted for 21 percent of the nation’s homeless population. This is an increase of 1.6 percent from the prior year. California also had the highest rate of unsheltered people, at 64 percent or 73,699 people; the largest numbers of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, at 10,416 people or 28 percent of the national total; the largest number of veterans experiencing homelessness, at 11,311 or 24 percent of the national homeless veteran population; and the second largest number of people in families with chronic patterns of homelessness, at 22,582 or 11 percent of the state’s homeless family population.
(c) California is home to 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, which has had a disproportionate impact on the middle class and the working poor. California requires the third highest wage in the country to afford housing, behind Hawaii and Washington, D.C. The fair market rent, which indicates the amount of money that a given property would require if it were open for leasing, for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,386. To afford this level of rent and utilities, without paying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household must earn an hourly “housing wage” of $26.65 per hour. This means that a person earning minimum wage must work an average of three jobs to pay the rent for a two-bedroom unit. In some areas of the state, these numbers are even higher.
(d) Low-income families are forced to spend more and more of their income on rent, which leaves little else for other basic necessities. Many renters must postpone or forgo home ownership, live in more crowded housing, commute further to work, or, in some cases, choose to live and work elsewhere.
(e) California has seen a significant reduction of state funding in recent years. The funds from Proposition 46 of 2002 and Proposition 1C of 2006, totaling nearly $5 billion for a variety of affordable housing programs, have been expended. Combined with the loss of redevelopment funds, $1.5 billion of annual state investment dedicated to housing has been lost, leaving several critical housing programs unfunded.
(f) High housing costs and the shortage of housing stock in California directly affect the future health of California’s economy and, given the staggering numbers indicated above, bold action is necessary. Investment in existing and successful housing programs to expand the state’s housing stock should benefit California’s homeless and low-income earners, as well as some of the state’s most vulnerable populations, including foster and at-risk youth, persons with developmental and physical disabilities, farmworkers, the elderly, single parents with children, and survivors of domestic violence. Investments should also be made in housing for Medi-Cal recipients served through a county’s Section 1115 Waiver Whole Person Care Pilot program and family day care providers.
(g) Investment in housing creates jobs and provides local benefits. The estimated one-year impacts of building 100 rental apartments in a typical local area include $11.7 million in local income, $2.2 million in taxes and other revenue for local governments, and 161 local jobs or 1.62 jobs per apartment. The additional annually recurring impacts of building 100 rental apartments in a typical local area include $2.6 million in local income, $503,000 in taxes and other revenue for local governments, and 44 local jobs or .44 jobs per apartment.

CHAPTER  3. Fiscal Provisions
54010.
Bonds in the total amount of three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000), exclusive of refunding bonds issued pursuant to Section 54026, or so much thereof as is necessary as determined by the committee, are hereby authorized to be issued and sold for carrying out the purposes expressed in this part and to reimburse the General Obligation Bond Expense Revolving Fund pursuant to Section 16724.5 of the Government Code. All bonds herein authorized which have been duly issued, sold, and delivered as provided herein shall constitute valid and binding general obligations of the state, and the full faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged for the punctual payment of both principal of and interest on those bonds when due.
54012.
The bonds authorized by this part shall be prepared, executed, issued, sold, paid, and redeemed as provided in the State General Obligation Bond Law (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 16720) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code), except subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 16727 of the Government Code to the extent that those provisions are inconsistent with this part, and all of the provisions of that law as amended from time to time apply to the bonds and to this part, except as provided in Section 54028, and are hereby incorporated in this part as though set forth in full in this part.
54014.
(a) Solely for the purpose of authorizing the issuance and sale, pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law, of the bonds authorized by this part, the committee is continued in existence. For the purposes of this part, the Housing Finance Committee is “the committee” as that term is used in the State General Obligation Bond Law.
(b) The committee may adopt guidelines establishing requirements for administration of its financing programs to the extent necessary to protect the validity of, and tax exemption for, interest on the bonds. The guidelines shall not constitute rules, regulations, orders, or standards of general application and are not subject to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(c) For the purposes of the State General Obligation Bond Law, the Department of Housing and Community Development is designated the “board” for programs administered by the department, and the California Housing Finance Agency is the “board” for programs administered by the agency.
54016.
Upon request of the board stating that funds are needed for purposes of this part, the committee shall determine whether or not it is necessary or desirable to issue bonds authorized pursuant to this part in order to carry out the actions specified in Section 54006, and, if so, the amount of bonds to be issued and sold. Successive issues of bonds may be authorized and sold to carry out those actions progressively, and are not required to be sold at any one time. Bonds may bear interest subject to federal income tax.
54018.
There shall be collected annually, in the same manner and at the same time as other state revenue is collected, a sum of money in addition to the ordinary revenues of the state, sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on, the bonds each year. It is the duty of all officers charged by law with any duty in regard to the collections of state revenues to do or perform each and every act which is necessary to collect that additional sum.
54020.
Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, there is hereby appropriated from the General Fund in the State Treasury, for the purposes of this part, an amount that will equal the total of both of the following:
(a) The sum annually necessary to pay the principal of, and interest on, bonds issued and sold pursuant to this part, as the principal and interest become due and payable.
(b) The sum which is necessary to carry out Section 54024, appropriated without regard to fiscal years.
54022.
The board may request the Pooled Money Investment Board to make a loan from the Pooled Money Investment Account, in accordance with Section 16312 of the Government Code, for purposes of this part. The amount of the request shall not exceed the amount of the unsold bonds that the committee has, by resolution, authorized to be sold, excluding any refunding bonds authorized pursuant to Section 54026, for purposes of this part, less any amount withdrawn pursuant to Section 54024. The board shall execute any documents as required by the Pooled Money Investment Board to obtain and repay the loan. Any amount loaned shall be deposited in the fund to be allocated in accordance with this part.
54024.
For purposes of carrying out this part, the Director of Finance may, by executive order, authorize the withdrawal from the General Fund of any amount or amounts not to exceed the amount of the unsold bonds that the committee has, by resolution, authorized to be sold, excluding any refunding bonds authorized pursuant to Section 54026, for purposes of this part, less any amount withdrawn pursuant to Section 54022. Any amounts withdrawn shall be deposited in the fund to be allocated in accordance with this part. Any moneys made available under this section shall be returned to the General Fund, plus the interest that the amounts would have earned in the Pooled Money Investment Account, from moneys received from the sale of bonds which would otherwise be deposited in that fund.
54026.
The bonds may be refunded in accordance with Article 6 (commencing with Section 16780) of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code. Approval by the electors of this act shall constitute approval of any refunding bonds issued to refund bonds issued pursuant to this part, including any prior issued refunding bonds. Any bond refunded with the proceeds of a refunding bond as authorized by this section may be legally defeased to the extent permitted by law in the manner and to the extent set forth in the resolution, as amended from time to time, authorizing that refunded bond.
54028.
Notwithstanding any provisions in the State General Obligation Bond Law, the maturity date of any bonds authorized by this part shall not be later than 35 years from the date of each such bond. The maturity of each series shall be calculated from the date of each series.
54030.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, inasmuch as the proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by this part are not “proceeds of taxes” as that term is used in Article XIII B of the California Constitution, the disbursement of these proceeds is not subject to the limitations imposed by that article.
54032.
Notwithstanding any provision of the State General Obligation Bond Law with regard to the proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by this part that are subject to investment under Article 4 (commencing with Section 16470) of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the Treasurer may maintain a separate account for investment earnings, may order the payment of those earnings to comply with any rebate requirement applicable under federal law, and may otherwise direct the use and investment of those proceeds so as to maintain the tax-exempt status of tax-exempt bonds and to obtain any other advantage under federal law on behalf of the funds of this state.
54034.
All moneys derived from premiums and accrued interest on bonds sold pursuant to this part shall be transferred to the General Fund as a credit to expenditures for bond interest; provided, however, that amounts derived from premiums may be reserved and used to pay the costs of issuance of the related bonds prior to transfer to the General Fund.
SEC. 3.
Section 2 of this act shall become operative upon the adoption by the voters of the Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018.
SEC. 4.
Section 2 of this act shall be submitted by the Secretary of State to the voters at the November 6, 2018, statewide general election.
SEC. 5.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to maximize the time available for the analysis and preparation of the bond act proposed by Section 2 of this act, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Under existing law, there are programs providing assistance for, among other things, emergency housing, multifamily housing, farmworker housing, home ownership for very low and low-income households, and downpayment assistance for first-time home buyers. Existing law also authorizes the issuance of bonds in specified amounts pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law and requires that proceeds from the sale of these bonds be used to finance various existing housing programs, capital outlay related to infill development, brownfield cleanup that promotes infill development, and housing-related parks.
This bill would enact the Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018, which, if adopted, would authorize the issuance of bonds in the amount of $3,000,000,000 pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law. Proceeds from the sale of these bonds would be used to finance various existing housing programs, as well as infill infrastructure financing and affordable housing matching grant programs, as provided.
The bill would provide for submission of the bond act to the voters at the November 6, 2018, statewide general election in accordance with specified law.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add Part 16 (commencing with Section 54000) to Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, by providing the funds necessary therefor through an election for the issuance and sale of bonds of the State of California and for the handling and disposition of those funds, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
247,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.

Therefore, those pistols that are sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and by USA Shooting, the national governing body for international shooting competition in the United States, and that were used for Olympic target shooting purposes as of January 1, 2001, and that would otherwise fall within the definition of “assault weapon” pursuant to this section are exempt, as provided in subdivision (d).

(3) The Department of Justice shall create a program that is consistent with the purposes stated in subdivision (c) to exempt new models of competitive pistols that would otherwise fall within the definition of “assault weapon” pursuant to this section from being classified as an assault weapon. The exempt competitive pistols may be based on recommendations by USA Shooting consistent with the regulations contained in the USA Shooting Official Rules or may be based on the recommendation or rules of any other organization that the department deems relevant.
SEC. 2.
Section 30680 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
30680.
Section 30605 does not apply to the possession of an assault weapon by a person who has possessed the assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if all of the following are applicable:
(a) Prior to January 1, 2017, the person was eligible to register that assault weapon pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 30900.
(b) The person lawfully possessed that assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017.
(c) The person registers the assault weapon by January 1, 2018, in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 30900.
SEC. 3.
Section 30900 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
30900.
(a) (1) Any person who, prior to June 1, 1989, lawfully possessed an assault weapon, as defined in former Section 12276, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989, shall register the firearm by January 1, 1991, and any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was specified as an assault weapon pursuant to former Section 12276.5, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989 or as amended by Section 1 of Chapter 874 of the Statutes of 1990 or Section 3 of Chapter 954 of the Statutes of 1991, shall register the firearm within 90 days with the Department of Justice pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish.
(2) Except as provided in Section 30600, any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon pursuant to former Section 12276.1, as it read in Section 7 of Chapter 129 of the Statutes of 1999, and which was not specified as an assault weapon under former Section 12276, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989 or as amended at any time before January 1, 2001, or former Section 12276.5, as added by Section 3 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1989 or as amended at any time before January 1, 2001, shall register the firearm by January 1, 2001, with the department pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish.
(3) The registration shall contain a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely, including all identification marks, the full name, address, date of birth, and thumbprint of the owner, and any other information that the department may deem appropriate.
(4) The department may charge a fee for registration of up to twenty dollars ($20) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. After the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, fees charged shall increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act but not to exceed the reasonable costs of the department. The fees shall be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account.
(b) (1) Any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined in Section 30515, including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be readily removed from the firearm with the use of a tool, shall register the firearm before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (5), with the department pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish by regulation pursuant to paragraph (5).
(2) Registrations shall be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department.
(3) The registration shall contain a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely, including all identification marks, the date the firearm was acquired, the name and address of the individual from whom, or business from which, the firearm was acquired, as well as the registrant’s full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, sex, height, weight, eye color, hair color, and California driver’s license number or California identification card number.
(4) The department may charge a fee in an amount of up to fifteen dollars ($15) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The fee shall be paid by debit or credit card at the time that the electronic registration is submitted to the department. The fee shall be deposited in the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account to be used for purposes of this section.
(5) The department shall adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing this subdivision. These regulations are exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a second handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle, or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires that any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, be punished as a felony or for a period not to exceed one year in a county jail.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that provision a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined, and including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 30515 and 30900 of, and to add Section 30680 to, the Penal Code, relating to firearms."

Existing law requires the program to accept payments from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, inclusive. Existing law requires the program to accept a reduced payment in full satisfaction of the fine or bail if the program participant certifies under penalty of perjury that he or she receives specified public benefits or his or her income is 125% or less of the current poverty guidelines. If the driving privilege of an amnesty program participant or a person who is in good standing in a comprehensive collection program has been suspended due to a Vehicle Code violation that is subject to the amnesty program, existing law requires the court to issue and file a certificate with the Department of Motor Vehicles demonstrating that the participant has appeared in court, paid the fine, or has otherwise satisfied the court.
This bill would require the court to issue and file the certificate with the department within 90 days. For applications submitted prior to January 1, 2017, the bill would require the court to issue and file the certificate no later than March 31, 2017.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law generally punishes the willful disobedience of a court order as contempt of court by imprisonment in a county jail for a term not exceeding 6 months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both that imprisonment and fine. Existing law makes the willful and knowing violation of specified protective orders or stay-away court orders punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine for a first offense, and makes a 2nd or subsequent conviction for a violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders occurring within 7 years of a prior conviction and involving an act of violence or credible threat of violence punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. If probation is granted upon conviction of a willful and knowing violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders, existing law requires the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements.
Under existing law, any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a spouse or former spouse, cohabitant or former cohabitant, fiancé or fiancée, or someone with whom the offender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship, or the mother or father of the offender’s child, is guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor. Upon a conviction under that provision, existing law authorizes the sentencing court to issue an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim for up to 10 years.
This bill would make a willful and knowing violation of the above protective order issued for the conviction of inflicting a corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine. The bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation occurring within 7 years involving an act of violence or a credible threat of violence punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor. If probation is granted for a violation of this protective order, the bill would require the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements. By increasing the punishment for a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(c) Most legacy oil and gas wells were abandoned in the early 1900s when there was little or no oversight of the abandonment and removal, if any, varied from well to well. Some legacy oil and gas wells, therefore, may seep oil into the surf zone impacting swimmers, surfers, and other recreational users, and causing environmental degradation.
(d) The State Lands Commission has primary jurisdiction over sovereign lands along the California coastline that are held in trust for statewide public purposes, including, commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation, and open space and habitat preservation.
(e) The State Lands Commission has long recognized the serious and perennial health concerns and safety hazards that coastal hazards and legacy oil and gas wells pose.
(f) There is a critical need for adequate funding to inventory coastal hazards, including legacy oil and gas wells and related infrastructure, along the California coastline in order to begin determining how to remove coastal hazards and to identify and remediate leaking legacy oil and gas wells.
(g) With adequate funding, the State Lands Commission can inventory coastal hazards, legacy oil and gas wells and other oil and gas related hazards along the California coastline, including determining GPS locations, assessing entitlement requirements, preparing preliminary engineering requirements and removal cost estimates for each hazard, and removing and remediating hazards that are a significant risk to public health and safety and the environment. Adequate funding will also enable the State Lands Commission to survey and monitor oil seepage in state waters under its jurisdiction and on tidelands, and to request studies to determine oil seepage locations, rates, environmental impacts, and mitigation measures.

Section 6212 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
6212.
(a) Upon appropriation of moneys by the Legislature for the purposes of this section, the commission shall, within two years, administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program to do all of the following:
(1) Complete an in-depth inventory of legacy oil and gas wells and other coastal hazards along the California coastline, including conducting field surveys and determining high-priority hazards and legacy oil and gas wells to remediate.
(2) Survey, study, and monitor oil seepage in state waters and tidelands under its jurisdiction to determine oil seepage locations, rates, and environmental impacts. The study information can facilitate possible mitigation measures.
(3) Begin the process of remediating improperly abandoned legacy oil and gas wells that have a high risk of leaking oil and, with any remaining funds, remove other identified coastal hazards.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 11005 of the Government Code and any other law requiring approval by a state officer of gifts, bequests, devises, or donations, the commission may seek and accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or donation whenever the gift and the terms and conditions thereof will aid in actions undertaken pursuant to subdivision (a).
(c) In cooperation with the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, the commission may seek to abandon legacy oil and gas wells that present a hazard to the public health and safety and the environment.
(d) The commission shall annually report to the Legislature the activities and accomplishments of the program. The commission may include this information in the annual report it submits pursuant to Section 8618.
(e) The commission shall prioritize its activities under this section based on available resources.
(f) For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1) “Coastal hazards” are legacy oil and gas wells and human-made structures that have been orphaned, including piers, jetties, groins, seawalls, and facilities associated with past oil extraction and other operations, that pose a hazard to the public health and safety. Coastal hazards may include, but are not limited to, wood or steel piles or piling, sheet metal pilings, H piles and H beams, well casings, well caissons, railroad irons, cables, angle bars, pipes, pipelines, rip rap, and wood beams and structures.
(2) “Legacy oil and gas wells” are wells drilled near shore, before current abandonment standards, where there is little or no information on the well’s abandonment procedure and there is no viable company with the responsibility to reabandon the well should it start leaking or pose a threat to the environment or the public health and safety.

Section 6217 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
6217.
With the exception of revenue derived from state school lands and from sources described in Sections 6217.6, 6301.5, 6301.6, 6855, and Sections 8551 to 8558, inclusive, and Section 6404 (insofar as the proceeds are from property that has been distributed or escheated to the state in connection with unclaimed estates of deceased persons), the commission shall deposit all revenue, money, and remittances received by the commission under this division, and under Chapter 138 of the Statutes of 1964, First Extraordinary Session, in the General Fund. Out of those funds deposited in the General Fund, sufficient moneys shall be made available each fiscal year for the following purposes:
(a) Payment of refunds, authorized by the commission, out of appropriations made for that purpose.

(2) Commencing with the 2018–19 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to bring the unencumbered balance of the Land Bank Fund available for the purpose of implementing the commission’s coastal hazard removal and remediation program provided in Section 6212 to five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and, notwithstanding Section 8610, shall be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the commission’s coastal hazard removal and remediation program provided in Section 6212.","(1) Existing law establishes the State Lands Commission in the Natural Resources Agency and prescribes the functions and duties of the commission. Under existing law, the commission has jurisdiction over various state lands, including coastal lands.
This bill would, upon appropriation of moneys by the Legislature, require the commission to, within 2 years, administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program, as specified. The bill would authorize the commission to seek and accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or donation whenever the gift and the terms and conditions thereof will aid in actions undertaken to administer that program.

The bill would require the commission to annually report to the Legislature the activities and accomplishments of the program.
(2) Existing law, with specified exceptions, generally requires the State Lands Commission, on and after July 1, 2006, to deposit all revenue, money, and remittances, derived from mineral extraction leases on state tide and submerged lands, including tideland oil revenue, into the General Fund, to be available upon appropriation by the Legislature for specified purposes. Existing law establishes the Land Bank Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, from which the commission may expend moneys for management and improvement of real property held by the commission, as trustee, to provide open space, habitat for plants and animals, and public access.
This bill would require that, for the 2017–18 fiscal year, out of those funds deposited into the General Fund by the commission, the sum of $500,000 be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the coastal hazard removal and remediation program. The bill would require that, commencing with the 2018–19 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to bring the unencumbered balance of the Land Bank Fund available for the purpose of implementing the program to $500,000 be transferred to that fund and be available, upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the program.","An act to amend Section 6217 of, and to add Section 6212 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to state lands."

Existing law requires all sums paid for the postponement of property taxes pursuant to these provisions to be secured by a lien in favor of the state. Amounts owed by a claimant are due if the claimant, or his or her surviving spouse, ceases to occupy the premises as his or her residential dwelling, dies, disposes of the property, or allows specified taxes and special assessments to become delinquent, as provided. Existing law requires that the residential dwelling be owned by the claimant, the claimant and spouse, or the claimant and another specified individual. Existing law requires a claimant to file a claim containing specified information, including a description of the residential dwelling, under penalty of perjury.

This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 20583 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by AB 1952 that would become operative if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
By requiring a special needs trust claimant for property tax postponement to file certain information under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(E) Ensure the independence of the medical professionals retained to perform the reviews through conflict-of-interest policies and prohibitions, and ensure adequate screening for conflicts of interest.
(4) A medical professional selected by the administrative director or the independent medical review organization to review medical treatment decisions shall be a physician, as specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), who meets the following minimum requirements:
(A) The medical professional shall be a clinician knowledgeable in the treatment of the employee’s medical condition, knowledgeable about the proposed treatment, and familiar with guidelines and protocols in the area of treatment under review.

(C) The medical professional shall have no history of disciplinary action or sanctions, including, but not limited to, loss of staff privileges or participation restrictions taken or pending by any hospital, government, or regulatory body.
(b) If, after the third physician’s opinion, the treatment or diagnostic service remains disputed, the injured employee may request an MPN independent medical review regarding the disputed treatment or diagnostic service still in dispute after the third physician’s opinion in accordance with Section 4616.3. The standard to be utilized for an MPN independent medical review is identical to that contained in the medical treatment utilization schedule established in Section 5307.27.
(c) An application for an MPN independent medical review shall be submitted to the administrative director on a one-page form provided by the administrative director entitled “MPN Independent Medical Review Application.” The form shall contain a signed release from the injured employee, or a person authorized pursuant to law to act on behalf of the injured employee, authorizing the release of medical and treatment information. The injured employee may provide any relevant material or documentation with the application. The administrative director or the independent medical review organization shall assign the MPN independent medical reviewer.
(d) Following receipt of the application for an MPN independent medical review, the employer or insurer shall provide the MPN independent medical reviewer, assigned pursuant to subdivision (c), with all information that was considered in relation to the disputed treatment or diagnostic service, including both of the following:

If the disputed health care service has not been provided and the MPN independent medical reviewer certifies in writing that an imminent and serious threat to the health of the injured employee may exist, including, but not limited to, serious pain, the potential loss of life, limb, or major bodily function, or the immediate and serious deterioration of the injured employee, the report shall be expedited and rendered within three days of the examination by the MPN independent medical reviewer. Subject to the approval of the administrative director, the deadlines for analyses and determinations involving both regular and expedited reviews may be extended by the administrative director for up to three days in extraordinary circumstances or for good cause.
(g) The MPN independent medical reviewer’s analysis shall cite the injured employee’s medical condition, the relevant documents in the record, and the relevant findings associated with the documents or any other information submitted to the MPN independent medical reviewer in order to support the determination.
(h) The administrative director shall immediately adopt the determination of the MPN independent medical reviewer, and shall promptly issue a written decision to the parties.
(i) If the determination of the MPN independent medical reviewer finds that the disputed treatment or diagnostic service is consistent with Section 5307.27, the injured employee may seek the disputed treatment or diagnostic service from a physician of his or her choice from within or outside the medical provider network. Treatment outside the medical provider network shall be provided consistent with Section 5307.27. The employer shall be liable for the cost of any approved medical treatment in accordance with Section 5307.1 or 5307.11.","Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of his or her employment. Existing law authorizes an insurer, employer, or entity that provides physician network services to establish or modify a medical provider network for the provision of medical treatment to injured employees, and requires the administrative director to contract with individual physicians or an independent medical review organization to perform medical provider network independent medical reviews. Existing law provides that if a treatment or diagnostic service remains disputed after a 3rd physician’s opinion, the injured employee may request a medical provider network independent medical review. Existing law requires the review to use standards established in statute or use the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines.

The treatment shall include, but need not be limited to, filtration with a micro or ultrafiltration system rated to 0.1 micron or less. The treatment shall, at a minimum, comply with all state laws and board regulations and all federal laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal Environmental Protection Agency Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Nothing in this division shall limit the state or the board in imposing more stringent treatment standards than those required by federal law.
(2) The Lake Alpine Water Company conducts a monitoring program for cryptosporidium, giardia, and total coliform bacteria, including E. coli and fecal coliform, at the reservoir intake and at posttreatment at a frequency determined by the board, but no less than three times during the period when bodily contact is allowed pursuant to paragraph (4).
(3) The reservoir is operated in compliance with regulations of the board.
(4) Bodily contact is allowed for no more than four months each year.
(b) The recreational use of Bear Lake Reservoir shall be subject to additional conditions and restrictions adopted by the entity operating the water supply reservoir, or required by the board, that are required to further protect or enhance the public health and safety and do not conflict with regulations of the board.
(c) The Lake Alpine Water Company shall file, on or before December 31, 2017, and biennially thereafter, with the Legislature in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code and the board, a report on the recreational uses at Bear Lake Reservoir and the water treatment program for that reservoir. That report shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following information:
(1) The estimated levels and types of recreational uses at the reservoir on a monthly basis.
(2) A summary of monitoring in the Bear Lake Reservoir watershed for cryptosporidium, giardia, and total coliform bacteria, including E. coli and fecal coliform.

(7) A summary of activities for operation of recreational uses and facilities in a manner that optimizes the water quality.
(8) The reservoir management plan and the operations plan.
(9) The annual water reports submitted to the consumers each year.
(d) If there is a change in operation of the treatment facility or a change in the quantity of water to be treated at the treatment facility, the board may require the entity operating the water supply reservoir to file a report that includes, but is not limited to, the information required in subdivision (c), and the entity shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that water quality will not be adversely affected.
(e) (1) The board shall, at the end of each recreational season, annually review monitoring and reporting data from the Bear Lake Reservoir to ensure full compliance with this section.

A failure to comply with this section shall be deemed a violation of Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 116270) of Part 12 and shall be subject to any applicable fines, penalties, or other enforcement action provided under that chapter.
(f) As used in this section, “board” means the State Water Resources Control Board.
(g) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2022, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2022, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the Bear Lake Reservoir. The facts constituting the special circumstances are:
Recreational activities occur at Bear Lake Reservoir pursuant to Section 115843.6 of the Health and Safety Code, provided certain conditions are met. The Lake Alpine Water Company will continue effective water treatment through microfiltration and disinfection in order for bodily contact to continue, and the company will provide information to the Legislature regarding certain issues to ensure that any recreational uses at the reservoir do not affect the provision of domestic water to district customers.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits recreational use involving bodily contact with the water in Bear Lake Reservoir unless certain conditions are satisfied, including that the water subsequently receives complete water treatment. Existing law requires the Lake Alpine Water Company, on or before January 1, 2016, to file with the Legislature a report on the recreational uses at Bear Lake Reservoir and the water treatment program for that reservoir. Existing law provides that, upon a finding of noncompliance, the Lake Alpine Water Company could be subject to suspension, amendment, or revocation of any permit issued pursuant to specified provisions, and that failure to comply with these provisions would be deemed a violation subject to specified fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2017.
This bill would extend the operation of all these provisions until January 1, 2022, and would require the Lake Alpine Water Company to file the report on or before December 31, 2017, and biennially thereafter until January 1, 2022. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Bear Lake Reservoir.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law regulates the care and maintenance of animals in the care of a pet store.
This bill would establish procedures for the care and maintenance of pets boarded at a pet boarding facility, including, but not limited to, sanitation, provision of enrichment for the pet, health of the pet, and safety. The bill would specifically authorize a city, county, or city and county to adopt ordinances that establish additional standards and requirements for a pet boarding facility. The bill would require an animal control officer, a humane officer, or a peace officer who detects a violation of specified provisions by a pet boarding facility operator to issue a notice to correct and would provide that if the operator complies with the notice to correct he or she would not be subject to an infraction, except as provided. The bill would provide that an operator that causes or allows harm or injury to an animal or allows an animal to be subject to an unreasonable risk of harm or injury is guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill, except as provided, would make a violation of these provisions an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250 for the first violation and not to exceed $1,000 for each subsequent violation. Because it would create a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 122380) to Part 6 of Division 105 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to pet boarding facilities."

(6) Apprenticeship or other training programs authorized by Section 3093, to the extent that the cost of training is reasonably related to the amount of the contributions.
(7) Worker protection and assistance programs or committees established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 175a), to the extent that the activities of the programs or committees are directed to the monitoring and enforcement of laws related to public works.
(8) Industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees, provided that these payments are made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated.
(9) Other purposes similar to those specified in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive; or other purposes similar to those specified in paragraphs (6) to (8), inclusive, if the payments are made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated.
(b) Employer payments include all of the following:
(1) The rate of contribution irrevocably made by the employer to a trustee or third person pursuant to a plan, fund, or program.
(2) The rate of actual costs to the employer reasonably anticipated in providing benefits to workers pursuant to an enforceable commitment to carry out a financially responsible plan or program communicated in writing to the workers affected.
(3) Payments to the California Apprenticeship Council pursuant to Section 1777.5.
(c) Employer payments are a credit against the obligation to pay the general prevailing rate of per diem wages. However, credit shall not be granted for benefits required to be provided by other state or federal law, for payments made to monitor and enforce laws related to public works if those payments are not made to a program or committee established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 175a), or for payments for industry advancement and collective bargaining agreement administrative fees if those payments are not made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated. Credits for employer payments also shall not reduce the obligation to pay the hourly straight time or overtime wages found to be prevailing. However, an increased employer payment contribution that results in a lower hourly straight time or overtime wage shall not be considered a violation of the applicable prevailing wage determination if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The increased employer payment is made pursuant to criteria set forth in a collective bargaining agreement.
(2) The basic hourly rate and increased employer payment are no less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages and the general prevailing rate for holiday and overtime work in the director’s general prevailing wage determination.

(2) When a copy of the collective bargaining agreement has previously been filed, fully executed copies of all modifications and extensions of the agreement that affect per diem wages or holidays shall be filed.
(3) The failure to comply with filing requirements of this subdivision shall not be grounds for setting aside a prevailing wage determination if the information taken into consideration is correct.","Existing law requires, except for public works projects of $1,000 or less, that workers employed on public works be paid not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality that the public work is performed, and not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work fixed, as prescribed.

This bill would instead require per diem wages to include industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees if the payments are made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated. The bill would also exclude from per diem wages, if the payments are not made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is obligated, employer payments for other purposes similar to certain apprenticeship or other training programs, worker protection and assistance programs or committees established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978, and industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees, as specified.
Existing law provides that employer payments are credits against the obligation to pay the general prevailing rate of per diem wages. Credit is prohibited for benefits required to be provided by other state or federal law or for payments made to monitor and enforce laws related to public works if those payments are not made to a program or committee established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978.

If the jury finds the defendant guilty, or if the defendant pleads only not guilty by reason of insanity, the question whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time the offense was committed shall be promptly tried, either before the same jury or before a new jury in the discretion of the court. In that trial, the jury shall return a verdict either that the defendant was sane at the time the offense was committed or was insane at the time the offense was committed.

A defendant committed to a state hospital or other treatment facility or placed on outpatient status pursuant to Title 15 (commencing with Section 1600) of Part 2 shall not be released from confinement, parole, or outpatient status unless and until the court that committed the person, after notice and hearing, finds and determines that the person’s sanity has been restored, or meets the criteria for release pursuant to Section 4146 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. This section does not prohibit the transfer of the patient from one state hospital to any other state hospital by proper authority. This section does not prohibit the transfer of the patient to a hospital in another state in the manner provided in Section 4119 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(c) If the defendant is committed or transferred to the State Department of State Hospitals pursuant to this section, the court may, upon receiving the written recommendation of the medical director of the state hospital and the community program director that the defendant be transferred to a public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director, order the defendant transferred to that facility. If the defendant is committed or transferred to a public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director, the court may, upon receiving the written recommendation of the community program director, order the defendant transferred to the State Department of State Hospitals or to another public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director. If either the defendant or the prosecuting attorney chooses to contest either kind of order of transfer, a petition may be filed in the court requesting a hearing, which shall be held if the court determines that sufficient grounds exist.

(5) The court has the discretion to suspend the commitment for compassionate release and release the patient if the court finds that the facts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) or subparagraphs (B) and (C) exist:
(A) The patient is terminally ill with an incurable condition caused by an illness or disease that would likely produce death within six months, as determined by a physician employed by the department.
(B) The conditions under which the patient would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety.
(C) The patient is permanently medically incapacitated with a medical condition that renders him or her permanently unable to perform activities of basic daily living and results in the patient requiring 24-hour total care, including, but not limited to, coma, persistent vegetative state, brain death, ventilator-dependency, or loss of control of muscular or neurological function, the incapacitation did not exist at the time of the original commitment, and the medical director responsible for the patient’s care and the Director of State Hospitals both certify that the patient is incapable of receiving mental health treatment.

(l) The State Department of State Hospitals, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including, but not limited to, local law enforcement and correctional officials, shall promulgate regulations in accordance with subdivision (i) to establish a process for petitioning the court for reinstatement of a suspended commitment order, pursuant to subdivision (k).","Existing law requires, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, that a jury determine whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time the offense was committed. Under existing law, if a defendant is found to be not guilty by reason of insanity, the court is required to commit the person to a state hospital, or a public or private treatment facility, or place him or her on outpatient status, as specified. Existing law, subject to exceptions, authorizes the release of a prisoner from state prison if the court finds that the prisoner is terminally ill with an incurable condition caused by an illness or disease that would produce death within 6 months, as determined by a physician employed by the department, and that conditions under which the prisoner would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety.
This bill would establish similar compassionate release provisions for a defendant who has been committed to a state hospital because, among other reasons, the defendant is incompetent to stand trial or to be adjudged to punishment, or the defendant is a mentally disordered offender, including a person who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The bill would make additional conforming changes and would authorize the director to adopt emergency regulations to implement these provisions.","An act to amend Section 1026 of, and to add Sections 1370.015 and 2977 to, the Penal Code, and to add Section 4146 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to criminal procedure."

The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances facing the County of Los Angeles.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the board of supervisors of each county, following each decennial federal census, and using that census as a basis, to adjust the boundaries of any or all of the supervisorial districts of the county so that the districts are as nearly equal in population as possible and comply with applicable federal law, and specifies the procedures the board of supervisors must follow in adjusting those boundaries. Existing law establishes the Independent Redistricting Commission in the County of San Diego, which is charged with adjusting the supervisorial district boundaries for the county.
This bill would establish the Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Los Angeles, which would be charged with adjusting the boundary lines of the districts of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Los Angeles. The commission would consist of 14 members who meet specified qualifications. This bill would require the commission to adjust the boundaries of the supervisorial districts in accordance with specified criteria and adopt a redistricting plan, which would become effective 30 days following its submission to the county elections official. By increasing the duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the unique circumstances facing the County of Los Angeles.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Chapter 6.3 (commencing with Section 21530) to Division 21 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) It is a matter of statewide concern that responsible competitive bidding at the University of California become more transparent than it is at present, in order that illegal and abusive employment practices by contractors can be prevented and, if not prevented, then brought to light and eliminated, with all victims of wage theft made whole for their employers’ violations.
(b) It is a matter of statewide concern that responsible competitive bidding at the University of California not undercut the wages and benefits provided by the University of California for comparable work, given that a significant percentage of University of California employees already are eligible for public benefits and any material decrease in the compensation of employees performing such work would result in materially increased General Fund costs for the provision of benefits.
(c) It is a matter of statewide concern that the University of California not repeat past instances in which public resources have been squandered via contracting out to for-profit private contractors that charge significant administrative overhead.
(d) In amending the Public Contract Code to promote responsible contracting at the University of California, it is important to delay the amendments’ effective date until January 1, 2018, in order to afford adequate preparatory time to the university and to contractors intending to bid on university contracts, as well as to lessen the cost of the amendments’ requirements by delaying their effect until after the university’s $15 per hour minimum wage for contracted employees is fully in effect.

(b) (1) A bidder shall certify in writing to the University of California that the bid includes a total employee compensation package, including fringe benefits, that is valued on a per-employee basis at a level sufficient that it does not undercut by more than 5 percent the average per-employee value of total compensation, including fringe benefits, for employees of the University of California who perform comparable work at the relevant campus, medical center, or laboratory at which the bidder proposes to perform the work.
(2) The University of California shall implement this section by including in its request for proposals a calculation of the average per-employee value of total compensation, including fringe benefits, for employees of the University of California who perform comparable work at the relevant campus, medical center, or laboratory, and that calculation shall use all known cost escalators to project the future rate of growth of average per-employee total compensation costs.
(c) A bidder shall certify in writing to the University of California that, within the prior five years, the bidder has not been found liable for any violation of Section 484 of the Penal Code, Sections 200 through 558, inclusive, 1197.5, or 2810.5 of the Labor Code, or any wage order issued by the Industrial Welfare Commission, in any amount totaling more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or 0.3 percent of the bidder’s most recent annual gross revenue, whichever is less.
(d) All records provided by a bidder or contractor to the university pursuant to this section shall be disclosed to any member of the public making a request to the university under Section 6253 of the Government Code, provided that (1) the university shall redact those portions of such records containing confidential information within the meaning of subdivision (c) of Section 6254 of the Government Code, and (2) the university, in responding to any request made during the course of a bid process that is not yet complete, shall delay until after the bid process is complete before disclosing any records containing materials submitted by a bidder.

Contracts for services to be performed, other than personal or professional services, involving an expenditure of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more annually shall be made or entered into with the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, or else all bids shall be rejected. If the regents deem it to be for the best interest of the university, the regents may, on the refusal or failure of the successful bidder for materials, goods, or services to execute a tendered contract, award it to the second lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications. If the second lowest responsible bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the regents may likewise award it to the third lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications.

If the second lowest responsible bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract, the regents may likewise award it to the third lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications.
(b) For the purposes of this section, contracts for services involving an expenditure of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more annually shall include any renewal or extension of an existing contract if the renewal or extension involves an expenditure of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more annually.
(c) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2018.","Existing provisions of the California Constitution provide that the University of California constitutes a public trust and require the university to be administered by the Regents of the University of California (regents), a corporation in the form of a board, with full powers of organization and government, subject to legislative control only for specified purposes, including any competitive bidding procedures as may be applicable to the university by statute for the letting of construction contracts, sales of real property, and purchasing of materials, goods, and services. Existing law requires the regents, except as provided, to let all contracts involving an expenditure of $100,000 or more annually for goods and materials or services, excepting personal or professional services, to the lowest responsible bidder meeting certain specifications, or to reject all bids. Existing law, until January 1, 2018, also authorizes the bid evaluation and selection for these contracts to be determined by the best value, as defined.

The bill would require the UC to include in its request for proposals a calculation of the average per-employee value of total compensation for UC employees who perform comparable work at the relevant location, as prescribed. The bill would, for these purposes, require contracts for services involving an expenditure of $100,000 or more annually to include any renewals or extensions of the contract that would result in an expenditure of $100,000 or more annually.
This bill would exclude specified employees and public works from these provisions.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Section 10507.7 of, and to add Section 10507.6 to, the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts."

(4) All laws regarding the confidentiality of health information and a patient’s right of access to his or her medical information shall apply to telephonic and electronic patient management services.
(5) This subdivision shall not apply to a patient in the custody of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or any other correctional facility.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), separate reimbursement of a physician or a nonphysician health care provider shall not be required for any of the following:
(1) A telephonic or electronic visit that is related to a service or procedure provided to an established patient within a reasonable period of time prior to the telephonic or electronic visit, as recognized by the Current Procedural Terminology codes published by the American Medical Association.

teledermatology
teledermatology,
and teledentistry by store and forward,” as defined to mean the asynchronous transmission of medical information to be reviewed at a later time by a licensed physician or optometrist, as specified, at a distant site.
This bill would enact similar provisions relating to the use of reproductive health care under the Medi-Cal program. The bill would provide that, to the extent that federal financial participation is available, face-to-face contact between a health care provider and a patient shall not be required under the Medi-Cal program for “reproductive health care provided by store and forward.” The bill would define that term to mean an asynchronous transmission of medical information to be reviewed at a later time by a physician, nurse practitioner, certified nurse midwife, licensed midwife, physician assistant, or registered nurse at a distant site, where the provider at the distant site reviews the dental information without the patient being present in real time, as defined and as specified.
The bill would require Medi-Cal managed care plans that contract with the department to cover reproductive health care provided by store and forward.
This bill would also provide that, to the extent federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals are obtained, telephonic and electronic patient management services, as defined, provided by a physician or nonphysician health care provider acting within his or her scope of licensure shall be a benefit under the Medi-Cal program in fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to seek approval of any state plan amendments necessary to implement these provisions.","An act to amend Section 14132.725 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal."
267,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 712.5 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:
712.5.
(a) (1) The commission shall cause an assessment to be completed by no later than July 1, 2018, of the adverse and beneficial economic impacts, and the net economic effects, for the County of San Luis Obispo and the surrounding regions, that could occur if the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant were to temporarily or permanently shut down before the powerplant’s current operating licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission expire or when the Pacific Gas and Electric Company closes the powerplant upon the expiration of its current licenses. The assessment shall include a review, as described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b), of potential actions for the state and local jurisdictions to consider in order to mitigate the adverse economic impact of a shutdown.
(2) The assessment shall be conducted by an independent third party, selected in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (c).
(b) The assessment shall consist of, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1) Estimates of any changes in local tax revenues, changes in workforce populations, changes in indirect or induced economies, and potential impacts to ratepayers from a shutdown.
(2) A review of the economic impacts that affected the region surrounding the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station after it was decommissioned by the Southern California Edison Company and of the relevant decommissioning plans of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
(3) A review of regions in the United States similar to the County of San Luis Obispo and the surrounding regions that have experienced the decommissioning of a nuclear powerplant and of the resulting economic impacts of the decommissioning on those regions.
(4) Identification of any contingency plans that could mitigate the adverse economic impact of a shutdown to state and local jurisdictions, the local workforce, and entities receiving enhanced tax revenue.
(c) (1) The commission shall issue a request for proposal for the independent third party that will ensure that the selected party is able to make an independent review and analysis of the data described in subdivision (b).
(2) The independent third party shall consult with the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo, the governing board of the San Luis Coastal Unified School District, the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California at Berkeley, the regional economic development group of the County of San Luis Obispo, and other relevant governmental entities or community-based organizations to assist in an accurate assessment of the economic and workforce impacts of a shutdown.
(d) The commission shall make the assessment publicly available on its Internet Web site, distribute copies to relevant state and local jurisdictions, and convene a public forum in the County of San Luis Obispo on the findings and recommendations of the assessment.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because, currently, the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, owned and operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, is the last operating nuclear powerplant in California, and, on June 21, 2016, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced that it would not renew its licenses for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2, which are set to expire in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In addition, a joint proposal governing the closure of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2, which included an orderly replacement of electricity from generating resources that do not emit greenhouse gases and an employee retention severance program, was signed by interested parties. Local communities were ill-prepared and given no notice after the sudden closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was announced on June 7, 2013, and the state is still responding, at significant cost, to the sudden, permanent, and unexpected loss of baseline electricity. Therefore, an assessment is needed on the economic impact specific to a shutdown of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant to provide the state, and local communities, with valuable and necessary information to plan and prepare for that circumstance. The findings and recommendations made are not intended to interfere with or invalidate the joint proposal and can be used by local communities and parties to the joint proposal to provide further information and recommendations to minimize the local economic and other impacts that the planned closure may cause.
SEC. 3.
The Public Utilities Commission shall approve the withdrawal of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) from the nuclear decommissioning trust funds established by Pacific Gas and Electric Company pursuant to the Nuclear Facility Decommissioning Act of 1985 (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 8321) of Division 4.1 of the Public Utilities Code) for the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant. The commission shall use the moneys for additional staffing to urgently effectuate the third-party assessment pursuant to Section 712.5 of the Public Utilities Code.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced on June 21, 2016, that it would not renew its licenses for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 and it is necessary for the Public Utilities Commission to immediately start the process of selecting an independent third party to conduct an economic assessment and to provide the independent third party with as much time as possible to conduct a thorough assessment.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Diablo Canyon nuclear powerplant, composed of reactor Units 1 and 2, is operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in the County of San Luis Obispo. Existing law requires the commission to convene, or continue, until August 26, 2025, an independent peer review panel to conduct an independent review of enhanced seismic studies and surveys of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, including the surrounding areas of the facility and areas of nuclear waste storage. The Nuclear Facility Decommissioning Act of 1985 requires each electrical corporation owning or operating nuclear facilities to establish an externally managed, segregated fund for payment of decommissioning costs of those facilities, establishes requirements for collection of moneys for decommisioning costs in the utility’s rates and charges, and requires that the expenses associated with decommissioning of nuclear facilities be paid from those funds. Pursuant to the act, the commission ordered 2 nuclear decommissioning funds be established for the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant.
This bill would require the commission to cause an assessment to be completed by no later than July 1, 2018, conducted by an independent 3rd party, selected as specified, of the adverse and beneficial economic impacts, and net economic effects, that could occur, and of potential ways for the state and local jurisdictions to mitigate the adverse economic impact, if the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant were to temporarily or permanently shut down before the powerplant’s current operating licenses expire or when the Pacific Gas and Electric Company closes the powerplant upon the expiration of its current licenses. The bill would require the commission to approve the withdrawal of $400,000 from the nuclear decommissioning funds established for the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant for use by the commission for additional staffing to urgently effectuate the 3rd-party assessment.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add Section 712.5 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity, making an appropriation therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

Vietnamese rice cakes are required to be handled, prepared, and stored under sanitary conditions both when they are kept at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit upon completion of cooking and after the rice cakes have been cooled to below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Any Vietnamese rice cakes that are unwrapped from the banana leaves after cooking shall be refrigerated.
SEC. 3.
Section 111223 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
111223.
(a) (1) All manufacturers of Asian rice-based noodles shall place a label on the packaging of Asian rice-based noodles that indicates the date and time that the product first came out of hot holding at temperatures above 135 degrees Fahrenheit and includes a statement that the Asian rice-based noodles are perishable.
(2) The product packaging shall only be labeled once.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this section does not apply to Vietnamese rice cakes that have been determined by the department to be nonpotentially hazardous foods based on formulation and supporting laboratory documentation submitted to the department by the manufacturer.
SEC. 4.
Section 114429.3 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
114429.3.
(a) Notwithstanding Sections 113996 and 114343 and if permitted by federal law, a food facility may sell Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit for no more than 24 hours.
(b) Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit but have been stored for more than 24 hours shall be destroyed in a manner approved by the enforcement agency.
(c) All Vietnamese rice cakes shall bear a label meeting the requirements of Section 111223.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, requires all manufacturers of Korean rice cakes, as defined, to place a label issued by the Korean Rice Cake Association Corporation on the Korean rice cake that indicates the date of manufacture, and requires the label to include a statement that the rice cake must be consumed within one day of manufacture. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill would require, except as provided, a manufacturer of Vietnamese rice cakes, as defined, to place a label, designed by the Vietnamese Rice Cake Association, Inc., on the Vietnamese rice cake that indicates the date and time the cooking process was completed, and would require the label to include a statement that the rice cake must be consumed within 24 hours of the date and time printed on the label. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, provides for the regulation of health and sanitation standards for food facilities, as defined, by the State Department of Public Health. Under existing law, local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing the California Retail Food Code. A violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a food facility to sell Korean rice cakes, as defined, that have been at room temperature for no more than 24 hours, and requires, at the end of the operating day, Korean rice cakes that have been at room temperature for no more than 24 hours to be destroyed in a manner approved by the enforcement agency.
This bill would also authorize a food facility to sell Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit for no more than 24 hours and would require Vietnamese rice cakes that have been at no more than 70 degrees Fahrenheit but have been stored for more than 24 hours to be destroyed in a manner approved by the enforcement agency. By imposing new enforcement requirements on local health agencies, and by creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Sections 111222 and 111223 of, to amend the heading of Article 14 (commencing with Section 111222) of Chapter 5 of Part 5 of Division 104 of, and to add Section 114429.3 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to food."

SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances relating to the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order for the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District to facilitate construction of facilities or other buildings in those districts at the earliest possible time pursuant to design-build authority, and to ensure the expedient provision of health care services in those districts at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take immediate effect.
SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)The overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant infections, a major public health threat.
(b)The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that at least 2,000,000 Americans are infected with, and at least 23,000 Americans die as a result of, antibiotic-resistant infections every year, resulting in at least $20 billion in direct health care costs and at least $35 billion in lost productivity in the United States.
(c)Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat. A recent study commissioned by the United Kingdom determined that by 2050, worldwide, more people will die from antibiotic-resistant infections than from cancer.
(d)The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine is a significant factor driving the development of antibiotic resistance, and a majority of antibiotics are prescribed in outpatient settings, including primary care physician offices, outpatient settings where physician assistants and nurse practitioners work, dentist offices, and other specialty health care providers.
(e)According to the CDC, in one year, 262.5 million courses of antibiotics are written in outpatient settings. This equates to more than five prescriptions written each year for every six people in the United States. The CDC estimates that over one-half of the antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary.
(f)More than 10 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed each year for viral conditions that do not benefit from antibiotics.
(g)Antibiotic stewardship programs, which are already required in general acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the state, but not in outpatient settings, are an effective way to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections.
(h)The President’s National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria calls for the establishment of antibiotic stewardship activities in all health care delivery settings, including outpatient settings, by 2020.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law authorizes certain health care districts to use the design-build process when contracting for the construction of a building or improvements directly related to construction of a hospital or health facility building in those districts, as specified. Existing law sets forth the procurement process for design-build projects, as specified, and requires specified information submitted by design-build entities to be certified under penalty of perjury.
This bill would authorize, until January 1, 2022, the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District to use the design-build process for the construction of facilities or other buildings in those districts, as specified. Because the bill would expand the application of the procurement process to additional design-build entities, the bill would expand the crime of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
(1)Under the existing Dental Practice Act, the Dental Board of California licenses and regulates the practice of dentistry. The act provides that an applicant may obtain an initial 2-year license to practice dentistry and a 2-year renewal license. The act also makes certain conduct unprofessional conduct and authorizes the board to revoke or suspend a license or reprimand or place on probation a dentist for that unprofessional conduct.
Under the existing Medical Practice Act, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, and the California Board of Podiatric Medicine establish requirements pursuant to which an applicant may obtain an initial 2-year license or subsequent 2-year renewal license to practice medicine as a podiatrist, as a physician and surgeon, osteopathic medicine as an osteopathic physician and surgeon, or podiatric medicine as a podiatrist, respectively. Under existing law, the Medical Board of California is required to adopt and administer standards for the continuing education of physicians and surgeons and each year audits a random sample of physicians and surgeons who have reported compliance with those requirements and requires a noncompliant licensee to make up the deficiency during the next renewal period. Under existing law, a licensee who fails to so comply is ineligible for a subsequent renewal license until he or she documents compliance to the board. Existing law provides for similar continuing education requirements as a condition of obtaining a renewal license to practice osteopathic medicine and podiatric medicine. The act authorizes these boards to discipline a licensee for specified unprofessional conduct.
This bill would require a “covered licensee,” defined as a dentist, physician and surgeon, osteopathic physician and surgeon, or person licensed to practice podiatric medicine, who practices in a setting other than a clinic, general acute care hospital, or skilled nursing facility, to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with specified guidelines or methods of intervention, as defined, before applying for a renewal license and, upon applying for a renewal license, to certify in writing, on a form prescribed by the respective licensing board, that he or she has both adopted an antimicrobial stewardship policy and is in compliance with that policy. The bill would require those licensing boards to audit, during each year, a random sample of covered licensees who have certified compliance with these requirements and would limit the audit of an individual covered licensee to once every 4 years. The bill would require a covered licensee who is selected for audit to submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a copy of his or her antimicrobial stewardship policy. The bill would require the respective licensing board, that determines that its audited covered licensee has failed to comply with these requirements, to require that covered licensee to comply with these requirements during the following renewal period. The bill would provide that the failure of a covered licensee to comply with those requirements during the renewal period constitutes unprofessional conduct.
(2)Under existing law, health facilities, including, among others, general acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, primary care clinics, and specialty clinics, are licensed and regulated by the State Department of Public Health, and a violation of those provisions is a crime. Existing law requires that each general acute care hospital, on or before July 1, 2015, adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy in accordance with guidelines established by the federal government and professional organizations that includes a process to evaluate the judicious use of antibiotics, as specified. Existing law requires each skilled nursing facility, on or before January 1, 2017, to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with guidelines developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other specified entities.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, require a clinic to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with specified guidelines or methods of intervention, as defined. Because this bill would create new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to
amend the heading of Article 2.6 (commencing with Section 1645) of Chapter 4 of Division 2 of, to amend the heading of Article 10 (commencing with Section 2190) of Chapter 5 of Division 2 of, and to add Sections 1645.5, 2197, 2454.6, and 2496.5 to, the Business and Professions Code, and to add Article 2.7 (commencing with Section 1223) of Chapter 1 of Division 2 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to antimicrobial stewardship.

SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the Counties of Alameda, Butte, Napa, Nevada, and Santa Clara. Recent research on the adolescent brain development has found that brain development continues well after an individual reaches 18 years of age. This bill would therefore allow for the criminal justice system to apply the most recent brain development research to its practices in these counties by allowing certain transitional age youth access to age-appropriate rehabilitative services available in the juvenile justice system when an assessment determines that the individual would benefit from the services, with the aim of reducing the likelihood of the youth continuing in the criminal justice system.","Existing law provides that entry of judgment may be deferred with respect to a defendant who is charged with certain crimes involving possession of controlled substances, who pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and who meets certain criteria, including that he or she has no prior convictions for any offense involving controlled substances and has had no felony convictions within the 5 years prior, as specified. Existing law requires the criminal charge or charges to be dismissed if the defendant has performed satisfactorily in a specified program during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted.
This bill would authorize specified counties to establish a pilot program to operate a deferred entry of judgment pilot program for eligible defendants. The bill would authorize a defendant to participate in the program within the county’s juvenile hall if that person is charged with committing a felony offense, except as specified, he or she pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and the probation department determines that the person meets specified requirements, including that the defendant is 18 years of age or older, but under 21 years of age on the date the offense was committed, is suitable for the program, and shows the ability to benefit from services generally reserved for delinquents. The bill would require the probation department to develop a plan for reentry services.
The bill would require the court to grant deferred entry of judgment if the eligible defendant consents to participate in the program, waives his or her right to a speedy trial or a speedy preliminary hearing, pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment. The bill would also require the court to render a finding of guilt to the charge or charges pleaded, enter judgment, and schedule a sentencing hearing, and would require the return of the defendant to custody in a county jail if the court finds that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the program or that the defendant is not benefiting from the services in the program. If the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted, at the end of that period, the bill would require the court to dismiss the criminal charge or charges.
The bill would require a county, prior to establishing a pilot program, to apply to the Board of State and Community Corrections for approval of a county institution as a suitable place for confinement for the purpose of the pilot program. The bill would require the board to review and approve or deny the application of the county within 30 days of receiving notice of this proposed use. The bill would also require each county to establish a multidisciplinary team consisting of representatives of specified local entities. The team would be required to meet periodically to review and discuss the implementation, practices, and impact of the program.
The bill would require the probation department to submit data relating to the effectiveness of the program to the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry, within the Department of Justice. The bill would prohibit a defendant participating in the program from coming into contact with minors within the juvenile hall, would prohibit a defendant from serving longer than one year in custody within a county’s juvenile hall pursuant to the program, and would require the board to review a county’s pilot program to ensure compliance with the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as specified.
The bill would require a county that establishes a pilot program pursuant to these provisions to submit data regarding the pilot program to the board, and would require the board to conduct an evaluation of the pilot program’s impact and effectiveness, as specified. The bill would require the evaluation to be combined into a comprehensive report and submitted to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Public Safety. The bill would also authorize the board to contract with an independent entity, including, but not limited to, the Regents of the University of California, to carry out these duties.

276,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Title 12.2 (commencing with Section 14230) is added to Part 4 of the Penal Code, to read:
TITLE 12.2. California Firearm Violence Research Act
14230.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Firearm violence is a significant public health and public safety problem in California and nationwide. Nationally, rates of fatal firearm violence have remained essentially unchanged for more than a decade, as declines in homicide have been offset by increases in suicide.
(b) California has been the site of some of the nation’s most infamous mass shootings, such as those at a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, near UC Santa Barbara in Isla Vista, and most recently at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Yet public mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of firearm violence. In 2014, there were 2,939 firearm-related deaths in California, including 1,582 suicides, 1,230 homicides, 89 deaths by legal intervention, and 38 unintentional or undetermined deaths. In communities where firearm violence is a frequent occurrence, the very structure of daily life is affected.
(c) Nationwide, the annual societal cost of firearm violence was estimated at two hundred twenty-nine billion dollars ($229,000,000,000) in 2012. A significant share of this burden falls on California. In 2013, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development noted that government-sponsored insurance programs covered nearly two-thirds of the costs of hospitalizations for firearm assaults in California, and about
half
one-half of
the costs of hospitalizations for unintentional injuries or those resulting from deliberate self-harm.
(d) California has been a leader in responding to this continuing crisis. However, although rates of fatal firearm violence in California are well below average for the 50 states, they are not low enough.
(e) Too little is known about firearm violence and its prevention. This is in substantial part because too little research has been done. The need for more research and more sophisticated research has repeatedly been emphasized. Because there has been so little support for research, only a small number of trained investigators are available.
(f) When confronted by other major health and social problems, California and the nation have mounted effective responses, coupling an expanded research effort with policy reform in the public’s interest. Motor vehicle accidents, cancer, heart disease, and tobacco use are all examples of the benefits of this approach.
(g) Federal funding for firearm violence research through the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
has been virtually eliminated by Congress since 1996, leaving a major gap that must be filled by other sources.
14231.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish a center for research into firearm-related violence. It is the intent of the Legislature that the center be administered by the University of California pursuant to the following principles:
(1) Interdisciplinary work of the center shall address the following:
(A) The nature of firearm violence, including individual and societal determinants of risk for involvement in firearm violence, whether as a victim or a perpetrator.
(B) The individual, community, and societal consequences of firearm violence.
(C) Prevention and treatment of firearm violence at the individual, community, and societal levels.
(2) The center shall conduct basic, translational, and transformative research with a mission to provide the scientific evidence on which sound firearm violence prevention policies and programs can be based. Its research shall
extend to firearm violence as a form of terrorism.
include, but not be limited to, the effectiveness of existing laws and policies intended to reduce firearm violence, including the criminal misuse of firearms, and efforts to promote the responsible ownership and use of firearms.
(3) The center shall work on a continuing basis with policymakers in the Legislature and state agencies to identify, implement, and evaluate innovative firearm violence prevention policies and programs.
(4) To help ensure a long-term and successful effort to understand and prevent firearm violence, the center shall recruit and provide specialized training opportunities for new researchers, including experienced investigators in related fields who are beginning work on firearm violence, young investigators who have completed their education, postdoctoral scholars, doctoral students, and undergraduates.
(5) It is the intent of the Legislature to support the center’s activities by funding the center with an appropriation to a Firearm Violence Research Center Account. The center may also seek additional federal, state, and private funds.
(6) As a supplement to its own research, the center shall administer a small grants program for research on firearm violence, funded through a research account in the Firearm Violence Research Center Account. All research funds shall be awarded on the basis of scientific merit as determined by an open, competitive peer review process that assures objectivity, consistency, and high quality. All qualified investigators, regardless of institutional affiliation, shall have equal access and opportunity to compete for the funds in the research account.
(7) The peer review process for the selection of grants awarded under this program shall be modeled on the process used by the National Institutes of Health in its grantmaking process.
(b) It is further the intent of the Legislature that on or before December 31, 2017, and every five years thereafter, the University of California transmit programmatic, as well as financial, reports to the state, including a report on the grants made, pending grants, program accomplishments, and the future direction of the program. The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(c) Subject to the conditions and requirements established elsewhere in statute, state agencies,
including
including,
but not limited
to
to,
the Department of Justice, the State Department of Public Health, the State Department of Health Care Services, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, and the Department of Motor Vehicles, shall provide to the center, upon proper request, the data necessary for the center to conduct its research.
(d) The center and all recipients of grants supported by the research account shall provide copies of their research publications to the Legislature and to agencies supplying data used in the conduct of that research as soon as is practicable following publication. These submissions shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(e) Toward these ends, the Legislature requests that the Regents of the University of California establish a Firearm Violence Research Center and administer the center and grant program pursuant
to
to,
and consistent
with
with,
the principles and goals stated herein.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect.
Existing law, until January 1, 2017, exempts from CEQA the design, site acquisition, construction, operation, or maintenance of certain structures and equipment of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) consisting of a long-term evolution broadband mobile data system and a land mobile radio system, if certain criteria are met at the individual project site, including that the site contains either an antenna support structure, as provided, or a public facility that transmits or receives public safety radio signals.
This bill would extend that exemption until January 1, 2020, and would specify that a fire station is not a public facility for purposes of determining if that exemption applies to an individual project site. The bill would provide that the exemption does not apply if the project site is located in certain areas. The bill would require the LA-RICS Joint Powers Authority to hold a public meeting before making a determination that a project is exempted, to file the notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research and the county clerk in the county in which the project is located, and to post certain information on its Internet Web site. Because a lead agency, which may include a local agency, would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for this exemption and to perform additional duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 21080.25 of the Public Resources Code, relating to environmental quality."

service provider shall exercise due diligence in providing any mental health or other contracted services pursuant to Section 2985.3 and shall notify the department of an individual’s participation in such services. A
parolee is not required to receive other ISMIP services as a condition of eligibility to receive rental assistance pursuant to this article.
SEC. 5.
Section 2985.3 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
2985.3.
(a) A service provider shall offer services, in accordance with Section 5806 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to obtain and maintain health and housing stability while the program participant is on parole, to enable the program participant to comply with the terms of parole, and to augment mental health services provided to the program participant.

(2) Upon referral to the service provider, the service provider shall work to transition a program participant from the department’s rental assistance to other mainstream rental assistance benefits if those benefits are necessary to enable the program participant to remain in stable housing, and shall prioritize transitioning the program participant to these benefits in a manner that allows the program participant to remain housed, when possible, without moving. Mainstream rental assistance benefits may include, but are not limited to, federal Housing Choice Voucher assistance, Department of Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing vouchers, or other rental assistance programs.
(3) The program participant’s parole discharge plan and the assessments shall consider the need for, and prioritize linkage to, county mental health services and housing opportunities that are supported by the Mental Health Services Act, the Mental Health Services Act Housing Program, or other funding sources that finance permanent supportive housing for persons with mental illness, so that the program participant may continue to achieve all recovery goals of the program and remain permanently housed when his or her parole is complete.
(4) The department and service providers shall not limit the bridge rental assistance made available to the program participant, except to the term of the program participant’s parole. The program participant shall be allowed to remain in the same housing after the bridge rental assistance ends, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the lease.
SEC. 6.
Section 2985.4 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
2985.4.
(a) A service provider shall identify and locate supportive housing opportunities for a program participant prior to his or her release from state prison or as quickly upon his or her release from state prison as possible, or as quickly as possible after the program participant is identified during parole, but in no case later than nine months after the program participant agrees to participate in the ISMIP program.
(b) Housing identified pursuant to subdivision (a) shall satisfy all of the following:
(1) The housing is located in an apartment building, single-room occupancy buildings, townhouses, or single-family homes, including rent-subsidized apartments leased in the open market or set aside within privately owned buildings.

(5) The percentage of program participants currently living in permanent housing.
(b) The department shall prepare an analysis of the costs of the supportive housing program in comparison to the cost savings to the state as a result of reduced recidivism rates by program participants using the information provided pursuant to subdivision (a). This analysis shall exclude from consideration any federal funds provided for services while the program participant is on parole in order to ensure that the analysis accurately reflects only the costs to the state for the services provided to program participants.
(c) The department shall annually submit, on or before February 1, the information collected pursuant to subdivision (a) and the analysis prepared pursuant to subdivision (b) to the chairs of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, the Senate Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review, the Assembly Committee on Budget, the Senate and Assembly Committees on Public Safety, the Senate Committee on Transportation and Housing, and the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development.","(1) Existing law authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to obtain day treatment, and to contract for crisis care services, for parolees with mental health problems, and requires the department to provide a supportive housing program that provides wraparound services to mentally ill parolees at risk of homelessness using funding appropriated for that purpose. Existing law provides that an inmate or parolee is eligible for participation if he or she has a serious mental disorder, as defined, has been assigned a release date from state prison, and is likely to become homeless upon release or is currently a homeless parolee. Existing law requires providers to offer various services, including housing location services and rental subsidies. Existing law requires a service provider to comply with specified requirements, including, among others, that the service provider has prior experience working with county or regional mental health programs.
This bill would require a service provider to also demonstrate an existing relationship with a supportive housing provider. The bill would specify that a program participant is not required to receive other services for mentally ill parolees as a condition of eligibility to receive rental assistance through the program.
The bill would require a service provider to exercise due diligence in providing any mental health or other contracted services and to notify the department of a participant’s participation in those services.
The bill would require a service provider to offer rental subsidies that are equal to or greater than fair market rent, as defined. The bill would also prohibit the department or a service provider from limiting the duration that a program participant may receive rental assistance through the program, except by the length of the person’s parole.
(2) Existing law requires a service provider to identify and locate supportive housing opportunities prior to a program participant’s release from state prison or as quickly upon release from state prison as possible, or as quickly as possible when a program participant is identified during parole. Existing law requires a service provider to report specified information to the department, including the number of program participants served and the outcomes for program participants, including the number of participants who returned to state prison.
This bill would require a service provider to identify and locate supportive housing opportunities no later than 9 months after the program participant has agreed to participate in the program. The bill would require that the housing located provide the program participant with a lease where he or she has all of the rights and responsibilities of tenancy. The bill would require a service provider to use a portion of the program payments received to provide interim housing, as defined. The bill would also require a service provider to report to the department the percentage of program participants currently living in permanent housing and the number who are arrested and residing in county jail. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive, and clarifying changes.","An act to amend Sections 2985, 2985.1, 2985.2, 2985.3, 2985.4, and 2985.5 of the Penal Code, relating to parolees."
279,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In 2012, about 35,000 children were born to 15- to 19-year-olds in California. Nationwide, 70 percent of young parents are pushed out of school, and fewer than 4 in 10 young mothers graduate from high school by 18 years of age.
(b) Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law protect all pupils’ rights to equal educational opportunities regardless of sex. Yet, only some of California’s school districts provide pregnant and parenting pupil programs.
(c) Pregnant and parenting pupils face overwhelming, system-enforced obstacles to graduating and receiving an education of equal quality to that of their peers that vary across school districts and include all of the following:
(1) Inconsistent access to excused “family leave” absences to care for new infants during the critical period of early child development, with male parents often having no access.
(2) Involuntary pushout due to high absence rates related to pregnancy and parenting responsibilities.
(3) Rigid requirements to verify excused absences to care for a sick child.
(4) Allowed “reasonable” amount of time to make up work is defined by the school districts and not to the individual circumstances or to support a pupil’s goal to graduate.
(5) Varying levels of support and engagement from schools while pupils are absent.
(6) Encouragement to pursue independent study that may not fulfill the “A-G” admission requirements for the California State University and the University of California or have inconsistent and rigorous attendance policies.
(7) Parenting pupils’ lack of awareness of their rights under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law, as well as pupils’ different educational options during pregnancy, postpartum, and as a parent.
(d) While California has an 80 percent high school graduation rate, only 38 percent of young moms who have a child before they are 18 years of age graduate from high school, 19 percent get a General Education Development (GED) credential, and only 2 percent go to college before 30 years of age.
(e) Educational challenges set the stage for economic hardship: The median income for women over 25 years of age without a high school degree is $15,021, less than 53 percent of that of their peers’ median income of $31,904.
(f) Nearly 60 percent of mothers under 19 years of age live in poverty.
(g) Children of teen mothers tend to struggle more in school, are less likely to complete high school, have lower performance on standardized tests, and are more likely to enter the foster care system and become teen parents themselves.
(h) Studies show that pregnancy can motivate pupils to complete school and pursue postsecondary education.
(i) Further, bonding time is critical for an infant’s long-term development and the well-being of parents. California has acknowledged the importance of bonding time and paved the way in supporting bonding within working families.
(j) Since 2004, workers have been entitled to up to six weeks of family leave to bond with their children. Working families benefit significantly from bonding time. Parenting pupils and their infants, some of our most vulnerable citizens, should not have to choose between their family and education.
SEC. 2.
Section 222.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:
222.5.
A school district shall notify pregnant and parenting pupils of their rights and options available pursuant to Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and Sections 222, 46015, and 48206.3 through annual school year welcome packets pursuant to Section 48980, through independent study packets, on the school district’s Internet Web site, in lactation rooms, and in locker rooms.
SEC. 3.
Section 46015 is added to the Education Code, to read:
46015.
(a) The governing board of a school district may
allow
adopt a policy that allows
a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to six weeks of parental leave and may allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to three weeks of parental leave after the birth. The length of leave shall be determined by the pupil and shall not exceed the length of time allowed by this subdivision.
(b) (1) Absences allowed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5 if the governing board of the school district of attendance files an expectant and parenting pupil policy, including procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, with the department.
(2) For purposes of calculating average daily attendance for a pupil on parental leave, one day of attendance shall be credited for each hour spent on activities related to the instruction of that pupil, with a maximum equivalent of the limits specified in subdivision (a). For purposes of this paragraph, “activities related to the instruction of that pupil” means activities that require contact with the pupil.
(3) An expectant and parenting pupil policy shall require a pupil to submit a parental leave request form, similar or the same as request forms used to request temporary disability time off, to the pupil’s school before the end of the pregnant pupil’s second trimester. A school shall process a request within five business days and provide makeup work plan development process guidelines to a pupil in conjunction with the positive determination of parental leave.
SEC. 4.
Section 48205 of the Education Code is amended to read:
48205.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 48200, a pupil shall be excused from school when the absence is:
(1) Due to his or her illness.
(2) Due to quarantine under the direction of a county or city health officer.
(3) For the purpose of having medical, dental, optometrical, or chiropractic services rendered.
(4) For the purpose of attending the funeral services of a member of his or her immediate family, so long as the absence is not more than one day if the service is conducted in California and not more than three days if the service is conducted outside California.
(5) For the purpose of jury duty in the manner provided for by law.
(6) Due to the illness or medical appointment during school hours of a child of whom the pupil is the custodial parent, including up to four absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school shall not require a note from a doctor.
(7) For justifiable personal reasons, including, but not limited to, an appearance in court, attendance at a funeral service, observance of a holiday or ceremony of his or her religion, attendance at religious retreats, attendance at an employment conference, or attendance at an educational conference on the legislative or judicial process offered by a nonprofit organization when the pupil’s absence is requested in writing by the parent or guardian and approved by the principal or a designated representative pursuant to uniform standards established by the governing board.
(8) For the purpose of serving as a member of a precinct board for an election pursuant to Section 12302 of the Elections Code.
(9) For the purpose of spending time with a member of the pupil’s immediate family, who is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined in Section 49701, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from, deployment to a combat zone or combat support position. Absences granted pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted for a period of time to be determined at the discretion of the superintendent of the school district.
(b) A pupil absent from school under this section shall be allowed to complete all assignments and tests missed during the absence that can be reasonably provided and, upon satisfactory completion within a reasonable period of time, shall be given full credit therefor. The teacher of the class from which a pupil is absent shall determine which tests and assignments shall be reasonably equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the tests and assignments that the pupil missed during the absence.
(c) For purposes of this section, attendance at religious retreats shall not exceed four hours per semester.
(d) Absences pursuant to this section are deemed to be absences in computing average daily attendance and shall not generate state apportionment payments.
(e) “Immediate family,” as used in this section, has the same meaning as set forth in Section 45194, except that references therein to “employee” shall be deemed to be references to “pupil.”
SEC. 5.
Section 48206.3 of the Education Code is amended to read:
48206.3.
(a) Except for those pupils receiving individual instruction provided pursuant to Section 48206.5, a pupil with a temporary disability that makes attendance in the regular day classes or alternative education program in which the pupil is enrolled impossible or inadvisable shall receive individual instruction provided by the district in which the pupil is deemed to reside.
(b) For purposes of this section and Sections 48206.5, 48207, and 48208, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Individual instruction” means instruction provided to an individual pupil in the pupil’s home, in a hospital or other residential health facility, excluding state hospitals, or under other circumstances prescribed by regulations adopted for that purpose by the state board.
(2) “Temporary disability” means a physical, mental, or emotional disability incurred while a pupil is enrolled in regular day classes or an alternative education program, and after which the pupil can reasonably be expected to return to regular day classes or the alternative education program without special intervention. Temporary disability also includes pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom. A temporary disability shall not include a disability for which a pupil is identified as an individual with exceptional needs pursuant to Section 56026.
(c) (1) For purposes of computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5, each clock hour of teaching time devoted to individual instruction shall count as one day of attendance.
(2) A pupil shall not be credited with more than five days of attendance per calendar week, or more than the total number of calendar days that regular classes are maintained by the district in any fiscal year.
(d) Notice of the availability of individualized instruction shall be given pursuant to Section 48980.
SEC. 6.
Section 48208 of the Education Code is amended to read:
48208.
(a) It shall be the primary responsibility of the parent or guardian of a pupil with a temporary disability to notify the school district in which the pupil is deemed to reside pursuant to Section 48207 of the pupil’s presence in a qualifying hospital.
(b) Upon receipt of notification pursuant to subdivision (a), a school district shall do all of the following:
(1) (A) Within five working days of receipt of the notification, determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, when the individualized instruction may commence. Individualized instruction shall commence no later than five working days after the positive determination has been rendered.
(B) A school district shall provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil’s school or school district.
(2) Provide the pupil with individualized instruction pursuant to Section 48206.3. The school district may enter into an agreement with the school district in which the pupil previously attended regular day classes or an alternative education program, to have the school district the pupil previously attended provide the pupil with individualized instruction pursuant to Section 48206.3.
(3) Within five working days of the commencement of individualized instruction, provide the school district in which the pupil previously attended regular day classes or an alternative education program with written notice that the pupil shall not be counted by that school district for purposes of computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5, effective the date on which individualized instruction commenced.
SEC. 7.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires a pupil to be excused from school for specified types of absences and prohibits those excused absences from generating state apportionment payments by deeming them as absences in computing average daily attendance.
This bill would include as another type of excused absence, 4 absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school is prohibited from requiring a note from a doctor. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to
allow
adopt a policy that allows
a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to 6 weeks of parental leave and to allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to 3 weeks of parental leave. The bill would specify that parental leave absences shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance if the governing board of the school district of attendance files with the State Department of Education an expectant and parenting pupil policy that includes procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, and would specify the method for crediting average daily attendance for these pupils.
(2) Existing state regulations require an educational institution to treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from those conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability. Existing law requires a school district that receives notification of a pupil’s temporary disability to determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, to provide the individualized instruction, as specified.
This bill would require a school district to provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil’s school or school district.
(3) Existing law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, or other specified characteristics in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state financial aid.
This bill would require a school district to notify pregnant and parenting pupils of specified rights and options available to those pupils, as specified.
(4) To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 48205, 48206.3, and 48208 of, and to add Sections 222.5 and 46015 to, the Education Code, relating to pupil rights."

3003.5.
(a) Notwithstanding any other
provision of
law, when a person is released on parole after having served a term of imprisonment in state prison for any offense for which registration is required pursuant to Section 290, that person may not, during the period of parole, reside in any
single family
single-family
dwelling with any other person also required to register pursuant to Section 290, unless those persons are legally related by blood, marriage, or adoption. For purposes of this section,
“single family

dwelling” shall not include a residential facility
which
that
serves six or fewer persons.
(b)
(1)
Notwithstanding any other
provision of
law, it is unlawful for any person
convicted of any of the offenses enumerated in Section 667.61 and
for whom registration is required pursuant to Section 290 to reside within
2000
2,000
feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather.
The 2,000-foot residency restriction shall be measured by the shortest practical pedestrian or vehicle path.
(2) The state parole authority shall enforce the residency restriction required pursuant to this section until the sex offender is discharged from parole unless any of the following occur:
(A) The offender is subject to a greater preexisting residency restriction.
(B) The residency restriction is modified within the county in which the offender resides as provided by Section 3003.51.
(C) The residency restriction is found unconstitutional as applied within the county and no modified restriction can be constitutionally enforced.
(3) Any person subject to the residency restriction imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) may, if compliance is not reasonably possible within his or her county, seek relief pursuant to Section 3003.51.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit municipal jurisdictions from enacting local ordinances that further restrict the residency of any person for whom registration is required pursuant to Section 290.
SEC. 2.
Section 3003.51 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
3003.51.
(a) Any person prohibited pursuant to Section 3003.5 from living within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather, may seek relief from those restrictions if he or she cannot comply with the restriction because of the unavailability of compliant housing within his or her county of domicile.
(b) Any person seeking relief under this section may file a petition with the superior court of the county in which he or she resides. Notice of the petition shall be timely served on the state parole authority or other entity enforcing the subject sex offender residency restrictions.
(c) Notwithstanding any other law, original jurisdiction for any petition filed pursuant to this section shall lie with the appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed. The court may consolidate all pending petitions.
(d) The appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed pursuant to this section may grant the petition in whole or in part if the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence, and the court finds, each of the following:
(1) There is a pervasive lack of compliant housing within the petitioner’s county of domicile.
(2) The petitioner is among a substantial proportion of sex offenders subject to the 2,000 foot residency restriction who have, despite good faith efforts, been unable to find compliant housing within the county.
(3) The 2,000 foot restriction is the principal reason that those without a residence have been unable to find compliant housing.
(e) (1) Relief granted pursuant to this section may modify residential distance restrictions to comport with the geographic constraints within the subject county but modifications shall be narrowly crafted in order to substantially comply with the intent of the people in approving Section 3003.5.
(2) The court may, if necessary, bifurcate the application of residency restrictions so as to apply discrete restrictions to those who have been convicted of child molestation or other felony sex offenses involving victims under 18 years of age.
(f) If relief is granted or denied pursuant to this section, no subsequent petition shall be heard, unless the petitioner or petitioners establish in the petition, to the satisfaction of the court, both of the following:
(1) There has been a change of circumstances based upon a substantial decline in the availability of compliant housing.
(2) There has been a corresponding increase in the percentage of sex offenders who are unable to comply with the residency restriction due to the change of circumstances described in paragraph (1) since the court ruling on the prior petition.

In order to protect the public at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, prohibits any person who is required to register pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act from residing within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather.
This bill would require that the 2,000-foot residency restriction be measured by the shortest practical pedestrian or vehicle path. The bill would limit the residency restriction to persons convicted of specified offenses. The bill would clarify that the state parole authority shall enforce the residency restriction except under specified conditions. The bill would permit a person who is subject to the residency restriction to petition the superior court of the county within which he or she resides for relief from the requirement. The bill would provide that original jurisdiction for the petition would lie with the appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed. The bill would require the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a pervasive lack of compliant housing in the county, that the petitioner is among a substantial proportion of sex offenders subject to the residency restriction who are unable to find compliant housing, and that the housing restriction is the principal reason that those without a residence have been unable to find housing. The bill would allow relief to modify the residential distance restrictions if that relief is narrowly crafted, and would allow the court to bifurcate the application of residency restrictions so as to apply discrete restrictions to those who have been convicted of child molestation or other felony sex offenses involving victims under 18 years of age. The bill would prohibit a subsequent petition from being heard if relief is granted or denied, unless the petitioner establishes in the petition, to the satisfaction of the court, that circumstances regarding compliant housing have changed, as provided.
Proposition 83 permits the Legislature, by a vote of
2/3
of the membership of each house and in accordance with specified procedures, to amend the provisions of the act.
By amending Proposition 83, this bill would require a

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act or because costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The California Constitution establishes the Public Utilities Commission, authorizes the commission to establish rules for all public utilities, subject to control by the Legislature, and authorizes the Legislature, unlimited by the other provisions of the California Constitution, to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission that is cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities. The Public Utilities Act provides the commission with broad authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, while local publicly owned electric utilities and electrical cooperatives are under the direction of their governing boards. Existing law establishes requirements for equipment, practices, and facilities for public utilities, including standards, enforceable by the commission, for installation and maintenance of wires or cables used to conduct electricity. Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
This bill would require each electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, and electrical cooperative to construct, maintain, and operate its electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by those electrical lines and equipment. The bill would require each electrical corporation to annually prepare a wildfire mitigation plan. The bill would require each electrical corporation to submit its plan to the commission for review, as specified. The bill would require the commission to review and comment on the submitted plan, as specified. The bill would require the governing board of a local publicly owned electric utility or electrical cooperative to determine whether any portion of the geographical area where the utility’s overhead electrical lines and equipment are located has a significant risk of catastrophic wildfire resulting from those electrical lines and equipment and, if so, would require the local publicly owned electric utility or electrical cooperative, at an interval determined by the board, to present to the board for its approval those wildfire mitigation measures the utility intends to undertake to minimize the risk of its overhead electrical lines and equipment causing a catastrophic wildfire. By placing additional duties upon local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Because a violation of these provisions by an electrical corporation would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","An act to add Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 8385) to Division 4.1 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to public utilities."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California’s 4,200 units of local government have issued $1.5 trillion in debt since 1984. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission (CDIAC) was created in 1982 to provide information, education, and technical assistance on debt issuance and investments to local public agencies and other public finance professionals. Over the past three decades, CDIAC has emerged as a national thought leader in public finance.
(b) Nationally, there is approximately $3.7 trillion of state and local government debt outstanding. Of all outstanding state and local government debt, approximately 75 percent is held by households and mutual funds owned predominantly by households. State governments, local governments, and their stakeholders benefit from better data about public debt. Transparency on public debt promotes better government and market integrity. It is in the interest of the people that state and local agencies utilize technological opportunities to provide transparency to the public.
(c) State and local agencies should adopt comprehensive written debt management policies pursuant to the recommendation of the Government Finance Officers Association, a professional organization of over 18,000 public officials united to enhance and promote the professional management of governmental financial resources. These policies should reflect local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that all debt issuance of state and of local governments be published in a single, transparent online database that allows the citizens of California to analyze, interpret, and understand how debt authorized by the public is utilized to finance facilities and services at the state and local level.

Before approving any alternate annual method of reporting pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall consult with appropriate state and local debt issuers and organizations representing debt issuers for purposes that shall include, but not be limited to, making a proposed reporting method more efficient and less burdensome for issuers.","Existing law establishes the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission to, among other things, maintain contact with state and municipal bond issuers, underwriters, investors, and credit rating agencies to improve the market for state and local government debt issues and to assist state and local governments to prepare, market, and sell their debt issues. Existing law requires the commission to collect, maintain, and provide comprehensive information on all state and all local debt authorization and issuance and to serve as a statistical clearinghouse for all state and local debt issuance.
This bill would additionally require the commission to track and report on all state and local outstanding debt until fully repaid or redeemed.
Existing law requires the issuer of debt of state or local government to submit reports to the commission, within specified timeframes, of the proposed issuance of debt and of final sale, as provided.
This bill would require that the report of proposed debt include a certification by the issuer that it has adopted local debt policies, which include specified provisions concerning the use of debt and that the contemplated debt issuance is consistent with those local debt policies.
This bill would also require a state or local public agency to submit an annual report for any issue of debt for which it has submitted a report of final sale on or after January 21, 2017. The bill would require the annual report to cover a reporting period of July 1 to June 30, inclusive, and to include specified information about debt issued and outstanding and the use of proceeds from debt during the reporting period. The bill would require that the report be submitted within 7 months after the end of the reporting period by any method approved by the commission. The bill would require the commission to consult with appropriate state and local debt issuers and organizations representing debt issuers prior to approving any annual method of reporting pursuant to these provisions, as provided.

Existing law requires that a sign be conspicuously posted at any inspection station maintained at or near the California border stating that the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 may prohibit persons from bringing firearms into the state that were acquired outside of the state.
The bill would require that these inspection station signs also state that California law may prohibit a person from bringing a firearm into the state that was acquired outside of the state.

age.
Existing law generally regulates the sale and transfer of firearms. Existing law requires a firearms transaction conducted by a firearms dealer to include, among other things, a background check of the purchaser, and certain personal information about the purchaser to be submitted to the department. Existing law requires a firearm transfer between 2 persons, neither of whom are a firearms dealer, to be conducted through a dealer. Similarly, existing law requires a person who imports or transports a firearm into this state that was obtained outside of the state to have the firearm delivered to a dealer for delivery to that person.
This bill would provide a return process for firearms obtained under the circumstances described above and in violation of the requirement that a firearms dealer conduct the transfer. The bill would require the owner of the firearm to deliver the firearm to a firearms dealer, who would report taking possession of the firearm to the department, and would require the firearm to be returned to the prior owner after a background check and other requirements that apply to a firearms transaction conducted by a dealer have been met. A violation of these provisions by a dealer would be a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would make conforming changes to other provisions of law relating to records of firearms transactions kept by the department and a firearms dealer. The bill would, for firearms complying with those return provisions, make conforming changes to other provisions of law that provide exceptions from various prohibitions, including, among others, exceptions to the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm, to the prohibition against openly carrying a firearm, and to carrying a firearm that is not a handgun in public. The bill would, for firearms returned pursuant to the return provisions, also make exceptions to other provisions of law requiring firearm safety devices, firearm safety certificates, and regulating unsafe handguns.
Existing law makes it a crime for a person, corporation, or firm to sell, loan, or transfer a firearm to a minor or sell a handgun to an individual under 21 years of age. Existing law makes it a crime for a firearms dealer to supply, deliver, or give possession or control of a handgun to any person under 21 years of age, or any other firearm to a person under 18 years of age. Existing law makes these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the crimes are punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
This bill would make these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, as specified, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle.
Existing law, subject to exceptions, requires a firearms dealer to comply with certain requirements when delivering a firearm to a person, including, among others, that the firearm is not delivered within 10 days of the application to purchase and is not delivered to a person that the Department of Justice has notified the dealer is prohibited from receiving a firearm. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the violation is a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor.
This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a handgun, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.
By increasing the penalty for an existing offense, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would provide that the violations of failing to process a firearms transaction through a dealer when neither party to the transaction is a dealer, and of importing a firearm without it going to a dealer for delivery to the importer would not apply if the only evidence of the violation arises because of information supplied to the Department of Justice in connection with the return process described above.
Existing law prohibits a person, corporation, or dealer from acquiring a firearm for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm if the dealer has the intent to transfer the firearm to a minor or to evade specified requirements on the transfer of firearms, or in the case of a person, if the person intends to violate the requirement that the transaction be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer. A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.
This bill would similarly prohibit a person, corporation, or dealer from transporting a firearm or bringing a firearm into this state for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm with the intent specified above. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section

(a) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (h), a person shall not be initially employed by a community college district in an academic or classified position unless the person has within the last 60 days submitted to a tuberculosis risk assessment developed by the State Department of Public Health and the California Tuberculosis Controllers Association and, if risk factors are present, an examination to determine that he or she is free of active tuberculosis, by a physician and surgeon licensed under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code or a physician assistant practicing in compliance with Chapter 7.7 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code. This examination shall consist of an approved intradermal tuberculin test or any other test for tuberculosis infection recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and licensed by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that, if positive, shall be followed by an X-ray of the lungs.
(2) The X-ray film may be taken by a competent and qualified X-ray technician if the X-ray film is subsequently interpreted by a physician and surgeon licensed under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code.
(3) The district superintendent, or his or her designee, may exempt, for a period not to exceed 60 days following termination of the pregnancy, a pregnant employee from the requirement that a positive intradermal tuberculin test be followed by an X-ray of the lungs.
(b) Thereafter, employees who are skin test negative, or negative by any other test recommended by the CDC and licensed by the FDA, or were not tested because of a lack of risk factors, shall be required to undergo the foregoing tuberculosis risk assessment and, if risk factors exist, examination at least once each four years or more often if directed by the governing board upon recommendation of the local health officer for so long as the employee remains test negative by either the tuberculin skin test or any other test recommended by the CDC and licensed by the FDA. Once an employee has a documented positive skin test or any other test that has been recommended by the CDC and licensed by the FDA that has been followed by an X-ray, the foregoing tuberculosis risk assessments and examinations shall no longer be required, and referral shall be made within 30 days of completion of the examination to the local health officer to determine the need for followup care.
(c) If risk factors were present at the tuberculosis risk assessment and an examination occurs, after the examination an employee shall cause to be on file with the district superintendent a certificate from the examining physician and surgeon or physician assistant showing the employee was examined and found free from active tuberculosis. “Certificate,” as used in this subdivision, means a certificate signed by the examining physician and surgeon or physician assistant, or a notice from a public health agency or unit of the American Lung Association that indicates freedom from active tuberculosis. The latter, regardless of form, shall constitute evidence of compliance with this section.
(d) This tuberculosis risk assessment and, if risk factors are present, examination is a condition of initial employment and the expense incident thereto shall be borne by the applicant unless otherwise provided by rules of the governing board. However, the board may, if an applicant is accepted for employment, reimburse the person in a like manner prescribed for employees in subdivision (e).
(e) The governing board of each district shall reimburse the employee for the cost, if any, of the examination. The board may provide for the examination required by this section or may establish a reasonable fee for the examination that is reimbursable to employees of the district complying with this section.
(f) (1) At the discretion of the governing board, this section does not apply to those employees not requiring certification qualifications who are employed for any period of time less than a college year whose functions do not require frequent or prolonged contact with students.
(2) The governing board may, however, require the tuberculosis risk assessment and, if risk factors are present, examination and may, as a contract condition, require the assessment and examination of persons employed under contract, other than those persons specified in subdivision (a), if the board believes the presence of these persons in and around college premises would constitute a health hazard to students.
(g) If the governing board of a community college district determines by resolution, after hearing, that the health of students in the district would not be jeopardized thereby, this section does not apply to any employee of the district who files an affidavit stating that he or she adheres to the faith or teachings of any well-recognized religious sect, denomination, or organization and in accordance with its creed, tenets, or principles depends for healing upon prayer in the practice of religion and that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief he or she is free from active tuberculosis. If at any time there should be probable cause to believe that the affiant is afflicted with active tuberculosis, he or she may be excluded from service until the governing board of the employing district is satisfied that he or she is not so afflicted.
(h) (1) A person who transfers his or her employment from one campus or community college district to another shall be deemed to meet the requirements of subdivision (a) if the person can produce a certificate that shows that he or she within the past four years had a tuberculosis risk assessment that showed no risk factors were present or was examined and was found to be free of communicable tuberculosis, or if it is verified by the college previously employing him or her that it has a certificate on file that contains that showing.
(2) A person who transfers his or her employment from a private or parochial elementary school, secondary school, or nursery school to the community college district subject to this section shall be deemed to meet the requirements of subdivision (a) if the person can produce a certificate as provided for in Section 121525 of the Health and Safety Code that shows that he or she within the last four years had a tuberculosis risk assessment that showed no risk factors were present or was examined and was found to be free of communicable tuberculosis, or if it is verified by the school previously employing him or her that it has the certificate on file.
(i) (1) Any governing board of a community college district providing for the transportation of students under contract shall require as a condition of the contract the tuberculosis risk assessment and, if risk factors are present, examination for active tuberculosis, as provided in subdivision (a), of all drivers transporting the students. Privately contracted drivers who transport the students on an infrequent basis, not to exceed once a month, shall be excluded from this requirement.
(2) Examinations required pursuant to this subdivision shall be made available without charge by the local health officer.","Existing law prohibits a person from being employed by a community college in an academic or classified position unless the person has submitted to a tuberculosis examination within the past 60 days to determine that he or she is free of active tuberculosis.
This bill would instead prohibit employment unless the person, within 60 days, has submitted to a tuberculosis risk assessment and, if tuberculosis risk factors are identified, has undergone a tuberculosis examination.","An act to amend Section 87408.6 of the Education Code, relating to community colleges."

SECTION 1.
Section 40240 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
40240.
(a) Subject to subdivision (g), the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District may install automated forward facing parking control devices on city-owned or district-owned public transit vehicles, as defined by Section 99211 of the Public Utilities Code, for the purpose of video imaging of parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes. Citations shall be issued only for violations captured during the posted hours of operation for a transit-only traffic lane. The devices shall be angled and focused so as to capture video images of parking violations and not unnecessarily capture identifying images of other drivers, vehicles, and pedestrians. The devices shall record the date and time of the violation at the same time as the video images are captured.
(b) Prior to issuing notices of parking violations pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 40241, the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District shall commence a program to issue only warning notices for 30 days. The City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District shall also make a public announcement of the program at least 30 days prior to commencement of issuing notices of parking violations.
(c) A designated employee of the City and County of San Francisco, or a contracted law enforcement agency for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, who is qualified by the city and county or the district to issue parking citations, shall review video image recordings for the purpose of determining whether a parking violation occurred in a transit-only traffic lane. A violation of a statute, regulation, or ordinance governing vehicle parking under this code, under a federal or state statute or regulation, or under an ordinance enacted by the City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District occurring in a transit-only traffic lane observed by the designated employee in the recordings is subject to a civil penalty.
(d) The registered owner shall be permitted to review the video image evidence of the alleged violation during normal business hours at no cost.
(e) (1) Except as it may be included in court records described in Section 68152 of the Government Code, or as provided in paragraph (2), the video image evidence may be retained for up to six months from the date the information was first obtained, or 60 days after final disposition of the citation, whichever date is later, after which time the information shall be destroyed.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 26202.6 of the Government Code, video image evidence from forward facing automated enforcement devices that does not contain evidence of a parking violation occurring in a transit-only traffic lane shall be destroyed within 15 days after the information was first obtained.
(f) Notwithstanding Section 6253 of the Government Code, or any other law, the video image records are confidential. Public agencies shall use and allow access to these records only for the purposes authorized by this article.
(g) The authority for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to implement an automated enforcement system to enforce parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes exists only until January 1, 2022.
(h) The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this article:
(1) “Local agency” means the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
(2) “Transit-only traffic lane” means any designated transit-only lane on which use is restricted to mass transit vehicles, or other designated vehicles including taxis and vanpools, during posted times.
SEC. 2.
Section 40240.5 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:
40240.5.
(a) If the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District implements an automated enforcement system to enforce parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes pursuant to this article, the district shall provide to the transportation, privacy, and judiciary committees of the Legislature an evaluation report of the enforcement system’s effectiveness, impact on privacy, cost to implement, and generation of revenue, no later than January 1, 2021.
(b) (1) A report submitted pursuant to this section shall be submitted notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.
(2) A report submitted pursuant to this section shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
SEC. 3.
Section 40241 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
40241.
(a) A designated employee of the local agency, including a contracted law enforcement agency for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, shall issue a notice of parking violation to the registered owner of a vehicle within 15 calendar days of the date of the violation. The notice of parking violation shall set forth the violation of a statute, regulation, or ordinance governing vehicle parking under this code, under a federal or state statute or regulation, or under an ordinance enacted by the City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District occurring in a transit-only traffic lane, a statement indicating that payment is required within 21 calendar days from the date of citation issuance, and the procedure for the registered owner, lessee, or rentee to deposit the parking penalty or contest the citation pursuant to Section 40215. The notice of parking violation shall also set forth the date, time, and location of the violation, the vehicle license number, registration expiration date, if visible, the color of the vehicle, and, if possible, the make of the vehicle. The notice of parking violation, or copy of the notice, shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of business of the City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the notice. The City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District shall send information regarding the process for requesting review of the video image evidence along with the notice of parking violation.
(b) The notice of parking violation shall be served by depositing the notice in the United States mail to the registered owner’s last known address listed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Proof of mailing demonstrating that the notice of parking violation was mailed to that address shall be maintained by the local agency. If the registered owner, by appearance or by mail, makes payment to the processing agency or contests the violation within either 21 calendar days from the date of mailing of the citation, or 14 calendar days after the mailing of the notice of delinquent parking violation, the parking penalty shall consist solely of the amount of the original penalty.
(c) If, within 21 days after the notice of parking violation is issued, the local agency determines that, in the interest of justice, the notice of parking violation should be canceled, the local agency shall cancel the notice of parking violation pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 40215. The reason for the cancellation shall be set forth in writing.
(d) Following an initial review by the local agency, and an administrative hearing, pursuant to Section 40215, a contestant may seek court review by filing an appeal pursuant to Section 40230.
(e) The City and County of San Francisco or the contracted law enforcement agency for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District may contract with a private vendor for the processing of notices of parking violations and notices of delinquent violations. The City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District shall maintain overall control and supervision of the program.
SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances relating to enforcing parking violations in the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
SEC. 5.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 40240 of the Vehicle Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the individual privacy rights of those individuals depicted in video camera footage relating to parking violations, it is necessary that this act limit the public’s right of access to the images captured by an automated parking control device installed on Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District-owned public transit vehicles.","Existing law authorizes the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging, and authorizes San Francisco to install automated forward facing parking control devices on city-owned public transit vehicles for the purpose of video imaging parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes. Existing law requires a designated employee, who is qualified by San Francisco, to review video image recordings for the purpose of determining whether a parking violation occurred in a transit-only traffic lane, and to issue a notice of parking violation to a registered owner of a vehicle within 15 calendar days of the date of the violation. Existing laws makes these video image records confidential, and provides that these records are available only to public agencies to enforce parking violations. Existing law establishes the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
This bill would extend the provisions to the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, thereby authorizing the district to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging evidence and to install automated forward facing parking control devices on district-owned public transit vehicles. The bill would repeal the authority for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to implement an automated enforcement system to enforce parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes on January 1, 2022.
This bill would require, under designated circumstances, the district and the City and County of San Francisco to submit to the transportation, privacy, and judiciary committees of the Legislature evaluations of the automated enforcement system’s effectiveness, impact on privacy, cost to implement, and generation of revenue, no later than January 1, 2021.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to amend Sections 40240 and 40241 of, and to add Section 40240.5 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

Section 12955 of the Government Code is amended to read:

It shall be unlawful:

(g) For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts or practices declared unlawful in this section, or to attempt to do so.
(h) For any person, for profit, to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, ancestry, disability, genetic information, source of income, familial status, or national origin.
(i) For any person or other organization or entity whose business involves real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available a transaction, or in the terms and conditions of a transaction, because of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, source of income, familial status, disability, or genetic information.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law generally prohibits housing discrimination with respect to various personal characteristics including source of income. Existing law defines “source of income” for these purposes as lawful, verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant, which does not include a landlord.
This bill would amend the definition of “source of income” to also include specified federal, state, or local housing assistance or subsidies paid either to the tenant or directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant.
Existing law permits a person who holds an ownership interest of record in property that he or she believes is the subject of an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on, among other things, source of income, to record a Restrictive Covenant Modification, which is to include a copy of the original document with the illegal language stricken. Before recording the modification document, existing law requires the county recorder to submit the modification document and the original document to the county counsel who is required to determine whether the original document contains an unlawful restriction.
This bill, by revising the definition of source of income, would increase the requirements on a county counsel to determine if there exists an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on source of income, as described above. By creating new duties for county counsels, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend

1197.5.
(a) An employer shall not pay any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, except where the employer demonstrates:
(1) The wage differential is based upon one or more of the following factors:
(A) A seniority system.
(B) A merit system.
(C) A system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production.
(D) A bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience.

For purposes of this subparagraph, “business necessity” means an overriding legitimate business purpose such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the business purpose it is supposed to serve. This defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an alternative business practice exists that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.

(3) The one or more factors relied upon account for the entire wage differential.
(b) An employer shall not pay any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of another race or ethnicity for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, except where the employer demonstrates:

If the division finds that an employer has violated this section, it may supervise the payment of wages and interest found to be due and unpaid to employees under subdivision (a) or (b).

(h) An employee receiving less than the wage to which the employee is entitled under this section may recover in a civil action the balance of the wages, including interest thereon, and an equal amount as liquidated damages, together with the costs of the suit and reasonable attorney’s fees, notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage.

(a) Pays or causes to be paid any employee a wage less than the rate paid to an employee of another sex, race, or ethnicity, as required by Section 1197.5.
(b) Reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with Section 1197.5.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits an employer from paying any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, unless the employer demonstrates that specific, reasonably applied factors account for the entire wage differential. Existing law authorizes an employee paid lesser wages in violation of this prohibition to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, and authorizes the employee, the division, or the Department of Industrial Relations to commence a civil action for the wages the employee was deprived of because of the violation, interest on those wages, and liquidated damages. Under existing law, an employer or other person who violates or causes a violation of that prohibition, or who reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with that prohibition, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would also prohibit an employer from paying any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of another race or ethnicity for substantially similar work, as specified above. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code proposed by AB 1676 that would become operative only if AB 1676 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

According to the Office of the Attorney General, there are currently nine regional human trafficking task forces. One of those task forces includes the County of Alameda, which makes it uniquely situated to implement a service model that would produce improved outcomes for youth victims of human trafficking by providing comprehensive intervention and rehabilitation services, as an alternative to traditional prosecution or incarceration, or both.","Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the Counties of Alameda and Los Angeles, respectively, to create a pilot project, contingent upon local funding, for the purposes of developing a comprehensive, replicative, multidisciplinary model to address the needs and effective treatment of commercially sexually exploited minors, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of this program indefinitely in the County of Alameda. The bill would also expand the definition of a “commercially sexually exploited minor” to include, among others, a minor who has been adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, and would create a presumption that, if a minor has been arrested for engaging in prostitution, or is the subject of a petition to adjudge him or her a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, he or she is a commercially sexually exploited minor for the purposes of that definition.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Alameda.","An act to amend Sections 18259 and 18259.3 of, to amend the heading of Chapter 4.3 (commencing with Section 18259) of Part 6 of Division 9 of, and to repeal Sections 18259.1 and 18259.5 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to sexually exploited minors."
291,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) On December 4, 2015, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (Public Law 114-94).
(b) The FAST Act provides long-term funding certainty for surface transportation and requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to award certain grants pursuant to rulemaking.
(c) The FAST Act includes grant programs for states that meet requirements associated with impaired driving interventions, including 24/7 Sobriety programs. These programs typically approach impaired driving deterrence by focusing on the most high-risk offenders, requiring abstinence from alcohol or illegal drugs, testing compliance multiple times per day, and swiftly delivering defined consequences for noncompliance.
(d) The FAST Act permits the NHTSA to award 24/7 Sobriety program grants to states that meet two separate requirements:
(1) That a state enact and enforce a law that requires all individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or of driving while intoxicated to receive at least a 30-day restriction on driving privileges. California currently meets this requirement.
(2) That a state provide a 24/7 Sobriety program with statewide applicability. A “24/7 Sobriety program” is a state law or program that authorizes a state court or an agency with jurisdiction to require an individual who has committed a driving-under-the-influence offense to abstain from alcohol or controlled substances for a period of time and be subject to testing for alcohol or controlled substances at least twice per day at a testing location, or by a continuous transdermal monitoring device, or by an alternative method approved by the NHTSA. California does not yet meet this requirement.
(e) Additional federal grant moneys are available to states under the NHTSA’s highway safety programs and national priority safety programs pursuant to Sections 402 and 405 of Title 23 of the United States Code.
(f) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to authorize a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program so that California is eligible for the new 24/7 FAST Act grant funding and additional funding available through the NHTSA.
SECTION 1.
SEC. 2.
Section 164.2 is added to the Streets and Highways Code, to read:
164.2.
Federal funds derived from apportionments made to the state under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act,” Public Law
114-094)
114-94)
shall be identified and included in the fund estimates prepared pursuant to Sections 14524 and 14525 of the Government Code for purposes of the interregional transportation improvement program prepared by the department pursuant to Section 14526 of the Government Code, the regional transportation improvement programs prepared by the regional transportation agencies pursuant to Section 14527 of the Government Code, and the state transportation improvement program adopted by the commission pursuant to Section 14529 of the Government Code.
SEC. 3.
Section 23582.5 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:
23582.5.
(a) The court may order a person convicted of a violation of Section 23152 or 23153 to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program, as described in subdivision (d), as a condition of probation, parole, sentence, or work permit if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction.
(b) The court may require a person who has been arrested for a violation of Section 23152 or 23153 to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program, as described in subdivision (d), as a condition of release on bond, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction.
(c) A person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked pursuant to Section 13352 or 13353 and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege shall be permitted to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person was charged with the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations of Section 23152 or 23153 that resulted in a conviction. The restricted driving privilege granted under this subdivision shall be for a minimum of one year and may be conditioned on participation in the 24/7 Sobriety program as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program.
(d) For purposes of this section, a “24/7 Sobriety program” requires a participant to abstain from alcohol or controlled substance use for a designated period of time and be subject to at least twice-per-day breath testing for alcohol or periodic testing for controlled substances at a testing location. In the event of a hardship, testing for alcohol may be accomplished by a continuous transdermal monitoring device or by an alternative method approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Methodologies that provide immediate, in-person positive reinforcement for compliant behavior and the most immediate sanctions for noncompliant events are preferred testing methodologies under this program. However, a participant’s ability to maintain employment, schooling, or family life, usually due to lack of proximity to a testing location, may be considered a hardship for the purposes of this subdivision. The 24/7 Sobriety program methodology shall be evidence-based. “Evidence-based” means the program methodology meets at least two of the following criteria:
(1) Evaluation research shows that the program produces the expected positive results.
(2) The results can be attributed to the program itself, rather than to other extraneous factors or events.
(3) The evaluation is peer reviewed by experts in the field.
(4) The program is endorsed by a federal agency or respected research organization and included in its list of effective programs.
(e) A person ordered into a 24/7 Sobriety program may also be required to participate in any other driving-under-the-influence program required under California law, including, but not limited to, programs provided in Section 11836 of the Health and Safety Code.
(f) Testing locations and methods that provide the best ability to sanction a violation as close in time as reasonably feasible to the occurrence of the violation should be given preference.
(g) In order to enable all required defendants to participate, each person shall pay the program costs commensurate with the person’s ability to pay as determined pursuant to Section 11837.4 of the Health and Safety Code.
(h) The court shall not impose a program of more than 180 days in length unless the defendant tests positive for alcohol or an unauthorized controlled substance or fails to appear for a test.
(i) The Office of Traffic Safety shall include a description of the provisions authorizing the 24/7 Sobriety program pursuant to this section in its highway safety plan required to be submitted to the NHTSA under subsection (k) of Section 402 of Title 23 of the United States Code, including any application requirements necessary to qualify for grants under Section 405 of Title 23 of the United States Code.
(j) The department shall establish statewide uniform collection and reporting of all of the following data:
(1) Participant demographic information.
(2) Participant case history information.
(3) Testing information, including testing duration, test results, and testing attendance.
(4) Fees and fee payments.","Existing law establishes the state transportation improvement program process, pursuant to which the California Transportation Commission programs, on a biennial basis, available state and federal funds for transportation capital improvement projects, other than state highway rehabilitation and repair projects, for the 5-year period of the state transportation improvement program, based on the interregional transportation improvement program prepared by the Department of Transportation and the regional transportation improvement programs prepared by regional transportation planning agencies. Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to submit to the California Transportation Commission an estimate of state and federal funds reasonably expected to be available for future programming over the 5-year period in each state transportation improvement program, and requires the California Transportation Commission to adopt a fund estimate in that regard.
This bill would require the fund estimates prepared by the department and the commission to identify and include federal funds derived from apportionments made to the state under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST)
Act of 2015.
Existing law prohibits a person who has 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle. Existing law also prohibits a person while having 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle and concurrently doing any act forbidden by law, or neglecting any duty imposed by law in driving the vehicle, when the act or neglect proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver. A violation of either of these prohibitions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a court, in addition to imposing penalties and sanctions for those violations, to require the person to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a driving-under-the-influence program, which may include, among other things, education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to immediately suspend a person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a specified period of time if the person has driven a motor vehicle when the person had a certain blood-alcohol concentration. Existing law also requires the department to suspend or revoke the driving privilege of a person who refuses an officer’s request or fails to complete a chemical test or tests, as specified. Existing law authorizes certain individuals whose privilege is suspended or revoked pursuant to that provision to receive a restricted driver’s license if specified requirements are met, including the completion of specified periods of license suspension or revocation and, in some instances, the installation of an ignition interlock device on the person’s vehicle.
This bill would authorize the court to order a person convicted of a crime described above to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified “24/7 Sobriety program,” as defined, as a condition of probation, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the crime within 10 years of one or more separate crimes described above that resulted in a conviction. The bill also would authorize a court to order participation in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond for a person who has been charged with a crime described above, as specified. The bill would permit a person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked for certain violations, and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege, to be permitted to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program. The bill would define a “24/7 Sobriety program,” in part, as requiring a person in the program to abstain from alcohol and unauthorized controlled substances and be subject to frequent testing for alcohol and controlled substances, as specified. The bill would require a person participating in the program to pay the program costs, commensurate with the person’s ability to pay, as specified. The bill would make related legislative findings and declarations and state the intent of the Legislature to enact these provisions for the purpose of making the state eligible to receive grant funding under the FAST Act and additional funding from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.","An act to add Section 164.2 to the Streets and Highways Code,

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law requires the county superintendent of schools, the superintendent of a school district, or the owner or operator of a private school that provides transportation to or from a school or school activity to prepare a transportation safety plan containing procedures for school personnel to follow to ensure the safe transport of pupils, as prescribed.
This bill would require that plan to include procedures to ensure that a pupil is not left unattended on a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus, and procedures and standards for designating an adult chaperone, other than the driver, to accompany pupils on a school pupil activity bus. The bill would additionally require a charter school to prepare this plan.
Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to contract for the transportation of pupils attending schools within the district, as specified.
This bill would require the governing board of a school district to require that any contract for the transportation of pupils includes the requirement that a pupil shall not be left unattended on a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus, as provided.
Existing law requires applicants seeking to renew a certificate to drive a schoolbus or a school pupil activity bus to complete classroom instruction and training, as specified.
This bill would require that classroom instruction to also cover the inspection procedures to ensure pupils are not left unattended on a schoolbus or school pupil activity bus.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to refuse to issue or renew, and to revoke or suspend, a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus driver certificate under certain, listed conditions.
This bill would require certain school officials to notify the department when a driver of such a bus has left a pupil unattended onboard after a specified school entity or the driver’s employer has ordered and upheld disciplinary action against the driver for the driver’s actions and has made a finding that the driver’s actions constituted gross negligence, as defined. The bill would authorize the department to refuse to issue or renew, and to revoke or suspend, a bus driver certificate on these grounds. The bill would permit a former applicant or holder of a certificate whose certificate was revoked pursuant to these provisions to reapply for a certificate if the certificate revocation is reversed or dismissed by the department.
Existing law requires all schoolbuses to be equipped with certain safety features, as specified.
This bill would require, on or before the beginning of the 2018–19 school year, schoolbuses, school pupil activity buses, except as provided, youth buses, and child care motor vehicles to be equipped with a “child safety alert system,” which is a device located at the interior rear of a vehicle that requires the driver to either manually contact or scan the device before exiting the vehicle, thereby prompting the driver to inspect the entirety of the interior of the vehicle before exiting.
Because a violation of the above requirement would be a Vehicle Code infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 39831.3, 39860, and 40085 of, and to add Section 39843 to, the Education Code, and to amend Section 13370 of, and to add Article 18 (commencing with Section 28160) to Chapter 5 of Division 12 of, the Vehicle Code, relating to schoolbus safety."

(2) The Franchise Tax Board shall formally incorporate the scope, costs, and schedule changes associated with the implementation of the credit allowed by this section in its next anticipated Special Project Report for its Enterprise Data to Revenue Project.
(j) (1) In accordance with Section 41 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the purpose of the California Earned Income Tax Credit is to reduce poverty among California’s poorest working families and individuals. To measure whether the credit achieves its intended purpose, the Franchise Tax Board shall annually prepare a written report on the following:
(A) The number of tax returns claiming the credit.
(B) The number of individuals represented on tax returns claiming the credit.
(C) The average credit amount on tax returns claiming the credit.
(D) The distribution of credits by number of dependents and income ranges. The income ranges shall encompass the phase-in and phaseout ranges of the credit.
(E) Using data from tax returns claiming the credit, including an estimate of the federal tax credit determined under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, an estimate of the number of families who are lifted out of deep poverty by the credit and an estimate of the number of families who are lifted out of deep poverty by the combination of the credit and the federal tax credit. For the purposes of this subdivision, a family is in “deep poverty” if the income of the family is less than 50 percent of the federal poverty threshold.
(2) The Franchise Tax Board shall provide the written report to the Senate Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review, the Assembly Committee on Budget, the Senate and Assembly Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Governance and Finance, the Assembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation, and the Senate and Assembly Committees on Human Services.
(k) The tax credit allowed by this section shall be known as the California Earned Income Tax Credit.
(l) The amendments made to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.","The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income from specified sources and who meet certain other requirements.
The Personal Income Tax Law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment from the Tax Relief and Refund Account for an allowable credit in excess of tax liability, to an eligible individual in an amount determined in accordance with federal law as applicable for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor, as specified. Existing law creates the Tax Relief and Refund Account, which is continuously appropriated, and provides that required payments to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account, including amounts allowable as an earned income credit in excess of any tax liability. The Personal Income Tax Law provides that the amount of the credit is calculated as a percentage of the eligible individual’s earned income and is phased out above a specified amount as income increases. Under existing law, the credit percentage and the phaseout percentage is based on the number of qualifying children of the eligible individual. Existing law provides, in modified conformity with federal income tax law, in the case of an eligible individual with 3 or more qualifying children, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is 45%, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is the same as for an eligible individual with 2 or more children, which is 40%.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, would instead provide that, in the case of an eligible individual with 3 or more qualifying children, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is 45%, thereby increasing the credit percentage and the phaseout percentage for those eligible individuals for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
By increasing the allowable credit amount, this bill would authorize new payments from the Tax Relief and Refund Account for additional amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, thereby making an appropriation.","An act to amend Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, and making an appropriation therefor."

SECTION 1.
Section 1253.7 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
1253.7.
(a) For purposes of this chapter, “observation services” means outpatient services provided by a general acute care hospital and that have been ordered by a provider, to those patients who have unstable or uncertain conditions potentially serious enough to warrant close observation, but not so serious as to warrant inpatient admission to the hospital. Observation services may include the use of a bed, monitoring by nursing and other staff, and any other services that are reasonable and necessary to safely evaluate a patient’s condition or determine the need for a possible inpatient admission to the hospital.
(b) When a patient in an inpatient unit of a hospital or in an observation unit, as defined in subdivision (c), is receiving observation services, or following a change in a patient’s status from inpatient to observation, the patient shall receive written notice, as soon as practicable, that he or she is on observation status. The notice shall state that while on observation status, the patient’s care is being provided on an outpatient basis, which may affect his or her health care coverage reimbursement.
(c) For purposes of this chapter, “observation unit” means an area in which observation services are provided in a setting outside of any inpatient unit and that is not part of an emergency department of a general acute care hospital. A hospital may establish one or more observation units that shall be marked with signage identifying the observation unit area as an outpatient area. The signage shall use the term “outpatient” in the title of the designated area to indicate clearly to all patients and family members that the observation services provided in the center are not inpatient services. Identifying an observation unit by a name or term other than that used in this subdivision does not exempt the general acute care hospital from compliance with the requirements of this section.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 1275, an observation unit shall comply with the same licensed nurse-to-patient ratios as supplemental emergency services. This subdivision is not intended to alter or amend the effect of any regulation adopted pursuant to Section 1276.4 as of the effective date of the act that added this subdivision.

(a) The office shall maintain a file of all the reports filed under this chapter at its Sacramento office. Subject to any rules the office may prescribe, these reports shall be produced and made available for inspection upon the demand of any person, and shall also be posted on its Internet Web site, with the exception of discharge and encounter data that shall be available for public inspection unless the office determines, pursuant to applicable law, that an individual patient’s rights of confidentiality would be violated.
(b) The reports published pursuant to Section 128745 shall include an executive summary, written in plain English to the maximum extent practicable, that shall include, but not be limited to, a discussion of findings, conclusions, and trends concerning the overall quality of medical outcomes, including a comparison to reports from prior years, for the procedure or condition studied by the report. The office shall disseminate the reports as widely as practical to interested parties, including, but not limited to, hospitals, providers, the media, purchasers of health care, consumer or patient advocacy groups, and individual consumers. The reports shall be posted on the office’s Internet Web site.
(c) Copies certified by the office as being true and correct copies of reports properly filed with the office pursuant to this chapter, together with summaries, compilations, or supplementary reports prepared by the office, shall be introduced as evidence, where relevant, at any hearing, investigation, or other proceeding held, made, or taken by any state, county, or local governmental agency, board, or commission that participates as a purchaser of health facility services pursuant to the provisions of a publicly financed state or federal health care program. Each of these state, county, or local governmental agencies, boards, and commissions shall weigh and consider the reports made available to it pursuant to this subdivision in its formulation and implementation of policies, regulations, or procedures regarding reimbursement methods and rates in the administration of these publicly financed programs.
(d) The office shall compile and publish summaries of individual facility and aggregate data that do not contain patient-specific information for the purpose of public disclosure. Upon request, these shall include summaries of observation services data, in a format prescribed by the office. The summaries shall be posted on the office’s Internet Web site. The office may initiate and conduct studies as it determines will advance the purposes of this chapter.
(e) In order to ensure that accurate and timely data are available to the public in useful formats, the office shall establish a public liaison function. The public liaison shall provide technical assistance to the general public on the uses and applications of individual and aggregate health facility data and shall provide the director with an annual report on changes that can be made to improve the public’s access to data.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of health facilities, including, but not limited to, general acute care hospitals. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
Existing law authorizes the department to issue a special permit authorizing a health facility to offer one or more special services when specified requirements are met. Existing law requires general acute care hospitals to apply for supplemental services approval and requires the department, upon issuance and renewal of a license for certain health facilities, to separately identify on the license each supplemental service.
This bill would require a general acute care hospital that provides observation services, as defined, to comply with the same licensed nurse-to-patient ratios as supplemental emergency services, as specified. The bill would require that a patient receiving observation services receive written notice, as prescribed, that his or her care is being provided on an outpatient basis, which may affect the patient’s health coverage reimbursement. The bill would require observation units to be identified with specified signage, and would clarify that a general acute care hospital providing services described in the bill would not be exempt from these requirements because the hospital identifies those services by a name or term other than that used in the bill. Because a violation of these provisions by a health facility would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law, the Health Data and Advisory Council Consolidation Act, requires every organization that operates, conducts, or maintains a health facility to make and file with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) specified reports containing various financial and patient data. Existing law requires OSHPD to maintain a file of those reports in its Sacramento office and to compile and publish summaries of individual facility and aggregate data that do not contain patient-specific information for the purpose of public disclosure.
This bill would require OSHPD to include summaries of observation services data, upon request, in the data summaries maintained by OSHPD under the act.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 128765 of, and to add Section 1253.7 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to health care."

If any provision of this bill or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.","Existing law governs arbitration in civil proceedings. Under existing law, a neutral arbitrator is defined as one who is selected jointly by the parties or by the parties’ arbitrators, or is appointed by the court if the parties or their arbitrators cannot jointly select an arbitrator. Existing law requires a person selected to serve as a neutral arbitrator to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt as to the proposed neutral arbitrator’s impartiality. Existing law requires the disclosure to include, among other things, whether or not the proposed neutral arbitrator has a current arrangement concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral with a party to the proceeding, or is participating in, or has participated within the last 2 years in, discussions regarding such prospective employment or service.
This bill, in a consumer arbitration case, would also require the disclosure of any solicitation made within the last 2 years by, or at the direction of, a private arbitration company to a party or lawyer for a party.

(2) The requesting party, or the requesting party’s deposition officer, shall not be required to pay the reasonable costs or any estimate thereof before the records are available for delivery pursuant to the subpoena, but the witness may demand payment of costs pursuant to this section simultaneous with actual delivery of the subpoenaed records, and until payment is made, the witness is under no obligation to deliver the records.
(3) The witness shall submit an itemized statement for the costs to the requesting party, or the requesting party’s deposition officer, setting forth the reproduction and clerical costs incurred by the witness. If the costs exceed those authorized in paragraph (1), or if the witness refuses to produce an itemized statement of costs as required by paragraph (3), upon demand by the requesting party, or the requesting party’s deposition officer, the witness shall furnish a statement setting forth the actions taken by the witness in justification of the costs.
(4) The requesting party may petition the court in which the action is pending to recover from the witness all or a part of the costs paid to the witness, or to reduce all or a part of the costs charged by the witness, pursuant to this subdivision, on the grounds that those costs were excessive. Upon the filing of the petition the court shall issue an order to show cause and from the time the order is served on the witness the court has jurisdiction over the witness. The court may hear testimony on the order to show cause and if it finds that the costs demanded and collected, or charged but not collected, exceed the amount authorized by this subdivision, it shall order the witness to remit to the requesting party, or reduce its charge to the requesting party by an amount equal to, the amount of the excess. If the court finds the costs were excessive and charged in bad faith by the witness, the court shall order the witness to remit the full amount of the costs demanded and collected, or excuse the requesting party from any payment of costs charged but not collected, and the court shall also order the witness to pay the requesting party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorney’s fees.

(5) If a subpoena is served to compel the production of business records and is subsequently withdrawn, or is quashed, modified, or limited on a motion made other than by the witness, the witness shall be entitled to reimbursement pursuant to paragraph (1) for all reasonable costs incurred in compliance with the subpoena to the time that the requesting party has notified the witness that the subpoena has been withdrawn or quashed, modified, or limited. If the subpoena is withdrawn or quashed, if those costs are not paid within 30 days after demand therefor, the witness may file a motion in the court in which the action is pending for an order requiring payment, and the court shall award the payment of expenses and attorney’s fees in the manner set forth in paragraph (4).

If the records are retrieved from microfilm, the reasonable costs, as defined in paragraph (1), applies.
(c) If the personal attendance of the custodian of a record or other qualified witness is required pursuant to Section 1564, in a civil proceeding, he or she shall be entitled to the same witness fees and mileage permitted in a case where the subpoena requires the witness to attend and testify before a court in which the action or proceeding is pending and to any additional costs incurred as provided by subdivision (b).","Existing law provides that when a subpoena duces tecum is served upon the custodian of records or other qualified witness of a business in a criminal action in which the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen, and the subpoena requires the production of all or any part of the records of the business, it is sufficient compliance therewith if the custodian or other qualified witness, within 5 days after the receipt of the subpoena or within a time otherwise agreed upon, delivers a copy of all the records described in the subpoena to the clerk of the court, the judge, or another person, as specified. Existing law requires that the records be accompanied with an affidavit from the custodian attesting to specified information.
Existing law also provides for the service of search warrants for the seizure of business records, as specified.
This bill would authorize a custodian of business records to comply with a search warrant for certain business records by delivering a true, legible, and durable copy of all of the records described in the search warrant to the law enforcement agency ordered to execute the search warrant, if the warrant provides for compliance in that manner. The bill would require that the records be delivered within 5 days of receipt of the search warrant or such other time as is specified in the search warrant. The bill would require that the records be accompanied by an affidavit of the custodian of records attesting to the same information that is required with respect to a subpoena duces tecum.
Existing law authorizes all reasonable costs, as specified, incurred by a nonparty witness to be charged against the party serving the subpoena duces tecum.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","An act to amend Sections 1560, 1561, and 1563 of the Evidence Code, relating to evidence."

(d) (1) The department may adopt emergency regulations to implement and make specific this chapter in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. For the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act, the adoption of regulations shall be deemed an emergency and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, or general welfare. Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, these emergency regulations shall not be subject to the review and approval of the Office of Administrative Law. Notwithstanding Sections 11346.1 and 11349.6 of the Government Code, the department shall submit these regulations directly to the Secretary of State for filing. The regulations shall become effective immediately upon filing by the Secretary of State. Regulations shall be subject to public hearing within 120 days of filing with the Secretary of State and shall comply with Sections 11346.8 and 11346.9 of the Government Code or shall be repealed.
(2) The Office of Administrative Law shall provide for the printing and publication of these regulations in the California Code of Regulations. Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter shall not be repealed by the Office of Administrative Law and shall remain in effect until revised or repealed by the department.

The program shall provide genetic screening and followup services for persons who have the screening.
(b) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include tandem mass spectrometry screening for fatty acid oxidation, amino acid, organic acid disorders, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia as soon as possible. The department shall provide information with respect to these disorders and available testing resources to all women receiving prenatal care and to all women admitted to a hospital for delivery. If the department is unable to provide this statewide screening by August 1, 2005, the department shall temporarily obtain these testing services through a competitive bid process from one or more public or private laboratories that meet the department’s requirements for testing, quality assurance, and reporting. If the department determines that contracting for these services is more cost effective, and meets the other requirements of this chapter, than purchasing the tandem mass spectrometry equipment themselves, the department shall contract with one or more public or private laboratories.
(c) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as soon as possible. In implementing the SCID screening test, the department shall also screen for other T-cell lymphopenias that are detectable as a result of screening for SCID, insofar as it does not require additional costs or equipment beyond that needed to test for SCID.
(d) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and any other disease that is detectable in blood samples as soon as practicable, but no later than two years after the disease is adopted by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), or enrollment of the act amending this subdivision, whichever is later.","Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to establish a program for the development, provision, and evaluation of genetic disease testing.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Genetic Disease Testing Fund (GDTF), consisting of fees paid for newborn screening tests, and states the intent of the Legislature that all costs of the genetic disease testing program be fully supported by fees paid for newborn screening tests, which are deposited in the GDTF. Existing law also authorizes moneys in the GDTF to be used for the expansion of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include cystic fibrosis, biotinidase, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and exempts the expansion of contracts for this purpose from certain provisions of the Public Contract Code, the Government Code, and the State Administrative Manual, as specified.
This bill would require the department to expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for any disease that is detectable in blood samples as soon as practicable, but no later than 2 years after the disease is adopted by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), or enrollment of this bill, whichever is later. By expanding the purposes for which moneys from the GDTF may be expended, this bill would make an appropriation.","An act to amend Sections 124977 and 125001 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health, and making an appropriation therefor."

(6) The Controller may recover the reasonable costs, measured by the Controller’s standard rate, of an audit or review conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) from the collecting platform that was audited or reviewed.
(h) Unless the platform and the city, county, or city and county mutually agree to terminate the agreement, all of the following shall apply to a platform and a city, county, or city and county that, on or before June 1, 2016, have entered into a binding legal agreement relating to the collection of any tax levied pursuant to this chapter:
(1) The platform and the city, county, or city and county shall continue to be bound by the agreement and any election made by the platform or the city, county, or city and county pursuant to this section shall not be effective as to any other party to the agreement.
(2) The platform and the city, county, or city and county shall notify the Controller of the agreement.
(3) The platform’s collection or remittance of taxes levied pursuant to this chapter pursuant to the agreement shall not be subject to review or audit by the Controller pursuant to subdivision (g).
(i) A collecting platform that complies with review or audit parameters established by the Controller pursuant to this section shall not be required to provide to any local jurisdiction, including a collecting jurisdiction, personally identifiable information relating to operators using the collecting platform, or concerning transactions facilitated in the local jurisdiction by the collecting platform.
(j) This section does not limit the existing authority of a local jurisdiction to regulate operators, including any local regulation that requires operators to provide information concerning transactions conducted in the jurisdiction, provided that the requirements do not discriminate against transactions facilitated through a platform.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that providing short-term rental online platforms with uniform transient occupancy tax administration requirements will establish a level playing field among all providers and decrease the cost of complying with statutory collection and remittance requirements, and is therefore a matter of statewide concern and shall apply to charter cities, charter counties, and charter cities and counties.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 7282.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
Limiting disclosure of records obtained or generated by the Controller or a city, county, or city and county pertaining to audits or reviews of a platform’s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes furthers the purposes of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution by appropriately balancing the interest in public disclosure with the interest in preserving the confidentiality of taxpayer information and ensuring that this information is not used for improper purposes.
SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 7282.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
The preservation of the confidentiality of taxpayer information is furthered by ensuring that cities, counties, and cities and counties do not disclose information contained in, or derived from, any audit or review conducted by the Controller of a platform’s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes.
SECTION 1.
Section 53051 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
53051.
(a)Within 50 working days after the date of commencement of its legal existence, the governing body of each public agency shall file with the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State and also with the county clerk of each county in which the public agency maintains an office, a statement of the following facts:
(1)The full, legal name of the public agency.
(2)The official mailing address of the governing body of the public agency.
(3)The name and residence or business address of each member of the governing body of the public agency.
(4)The name, title, and residence or business address of the chairman, president, or other presiding officer, and clerk or secretary of the governing body of such public agency.
(b)Within 10 working days after any change in the facts required to be stated pursuant to subdivision (a), an amended statement containing the information required by subdivision (a) shall be filed as provided therein. The information submitted to the Secretary of State shall be on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
(c)It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and of the county clerk of each county to establish and maintain an indexed “Roster of Public Agencies,” to be so designated, which shall contain all information filed as required in subdivisions (a) and (b), which roster is hereby declared to be a public record.","(1) Existing law authorizes a city, county, or city and county to impose a tax on the privilege of occupying a room or other living space in a hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, or other lodging unless the occupancy is for a period of more than 30 days.
This bill, on and after July 1, 2017, would require every platform, as defined, that elects to assume the responsibility of collecting and remitting transient occupancy taxes on behalf of an operator to collect and remit the amount of the tax levied on a rental transaction facilitated by the platform for a unit that is offered for tourist or transient use and is located within a city, county, or city and county that has not elected to retain the responsibility for directly collecting the tax from operators, as specified. The bill would authorize a platform to make its election to assume responsibility, and a city, county, or city and county to make its election to retain responsibility, by notifying the Controller of the election on or before April 30, 2017. The bill would authorize a platform that does not make its election by April 30, 2017, to elect to assume responsibility by notifying the Controller on or after July 1, 2017, and would make this election effective 6 months after the Controller’s receipt of the notification or on the date specified in the notice, whichever is later. The bill would authorize a platform to discontinue an election, and a city, county, or city and county to make or discontinue an election, by notifying the Controller on or before June 30, 2019, or June 30 of any odd-numbered year thereafter, and would make this discontinuance or election effective on July 1, 2020, or July 1 of the first even-numbered year after notification.
This bill, commencing on January 1, 2017, and by December 31 of each year thereafter, would require the Controller to review or audit a platform’s collection and remittance of tax revenue pursuant to the bill and would prohibit the Controller or any person who obtains access to information contained in, or derived from, the review or audit to disclose information pertaining to any platform or other person required to provide information subject to audit or review, as specified. The bill would provide that a platform and a city, county, or city and county that, on or before June 1, 2016, have entered into a binding legal agreement relating to the collection of transient occupancy taxes are bound by the agreement and are required to notify the Controller of the agreement, that any election made to the Controller by the platform or the city, county, or city and county is not effective as to any other party to the agreement, and that the platform’s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes pursuant to the agreement are not subject to audit or review by the Controller pursuant to the bill, unless the platform and the city, county, and city and county mutually agree to terminate the agreement.
(2) The California Constitution authorizes a city or county to make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.
This bill would find and declare that providing short-term rental online platforms with uniform transient occupancy tax administration requirements is a matter of statewide concern, and that the bill therefore applies to charter cities, charter counties, and charter cities and counties.
(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(4) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
Existing law requires the governing body of each public agency, as defined, within 70 days after the commencement of its legal existence, to file, with the Secretary of State and the county clerk of each county in which the public agency maintains an office, a statement containing specified information about the public agency and its governing board and officers. Existing law requires, within 10 days after any change in that information, an amended statement to be filed.
This bill instead would require the statement to be filed within 50 working days after the date of commencement of an agency legal existence and would require an amended statement to be filed within 10 working days after any change in the information.","An act to

307,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) All citizens should be able to make their voices heard in the political process and hold their elected officials accountable.
(b) Elections for local or state elective office should be fair, open, and competitive.
(c) The increasing costs of political campaigns can force candidates to rely on large contributions from wealthy donors and special interests, which can give those wealthy donors and special interests disproportionate influence over governmental decisions.
(d) Such disproportionate influence can undermine the public’s trust that public officials are performing their duties in an impartial manner and that government is serving the needs and responding to the wishes of all citizens equally, without regard to their wealth.
(e) Special interests contribute more to incumbents than challengers because they seek access to elected officials, and such contributions account for a large portion of the financial incumbency advantage, as confirmed by recent studies such as those published in the Journal of Politics in 2014 and Political Research Quarterly in 2016.
(f) Citizen-funded election programs, in which qualified candidates can receive public funds for the purpose of communicating with voters rather than relying exclusively on private donors, have been enacted in six charter cities in California, as well as numerous other local and state jurisdictions.
(g) Citizen-funded election programs encourage competition by reducing the financial advantages of incumbency and making it possible for citizens from all walks of life, not only those with connections to wealthy donors or special interests, to run for office, as confirmed by recent studies such as those published in State Politics and Policy Quarterly in 2008, and by the Campaign Finance Institute in 2015 and the National Institute of Money in State Politics in 2016.
(h) By reducing reliance on wealthy donors and special interests, citizen-funded election programs inhibit improper practices, protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption, and protect the political integrity of our governmental institutions.
(i) In Johnson v. Bradley (1992) 4 Cal.4th 389, the California Supreme Court commented that “it seems obvious that public money reduces rather than increases the fund raising pressures on public office seekers and thereby reduces the undue influence of special interest groups.”
(j) In Buckley v. Valeo (1976) 424 U.S. 1, the United States Supreme Court recognized that “public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.”
(k) In Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett (2011) 564 U.S. 721, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that public financing of elections “can further ‘significant governmental interest[s]’ such as the state interest in preventing corruption,” quoting Buckley v. Valeo.
(l) In Buckley v. Valeo, the United States Supreme Court further noted that citizen-funded elections programs “facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people.”
(m) The absolute prohibition on public campaign financing allows special interests to gain disproportionate influence and unfairly favors incumbents. An exception should be created to permit citizen-funded election programs so that elections may be conducted more fairly.
SEC. 2.
Section 85300 of the Government Code is amended to read:
85300.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a public officer shall not expend, and a candidate shall not accept, any public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office.
(b) A public officer or candidate may expend or accept public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office if the state or a local governmental entity establishes a dedicated fund for this purpose by statute, ordinance, resolution, or charter, and both of the following are true:
(1) Public moneys held in the fund are available to all qualified, voluntarily participating candidates for the same office without regard to incumbency or political party preference.
(2) The state or local governmental entity has established criteria for determining a candidate’s qualification by statute, ordinance, resolution, or charter.
SEC. 3.
Section 89519.5 is added to the Government Code, to read:
89519.5.
(a) An officeholder who is convicted of a felony enumerated in Section 20 of the Elections Code, and whose conviction has become final, shall use funds held by the officeholder’s candidate controlled committee only for the following purposes:
(1) The payment of outstanding campaign debts or elected officer’s expenses.
(2) The repayment of contributions.
(b) Six months after the conviction becomes final, the officeholder shall forfeit any remaining funds subject to subdivision (a), and these funds shall be deposited in the General Fund.
(c) This section does not apply to funds held by a ballot measure committee or in a legal defense fund formed pursuant to Section 85304.
SEC. 4.
The provisions of this bill are severable. If any provision of this bill or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 6.
The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","Existing law prohibits a person who has been convicted of a felony involving bribery, embezzlement of public money, extortion or theft of public money, perjury, or conspiracy to commit any of those crimes, from being considered a candidate for, or elected to, a state or local elective office. Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides that campaign funds under the control of a former candidate or elected officer are considered surplus campaign funds at a prescribed time, and it prohibits the use of surplus campaign funds except for specified purposes.
This bill would prohibit an officeholder who is convicted of one of those enumerated felonies from using funds held by that officeholder’s candidate controlled committee for purposes other than certain purposes permitted for the use of surplus campaign funds. The bill would also require the officeholder to forfeit any remaining funds held 6 months after the conviction became final, and it would direct those funds to be deposited in the General Fund.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 prohibits a public officer from expending, and a candidate from accepting, public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office.
This bill would permit a public officer or candidate to expend or accept public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office if the state or a local governmental entity established a dedicated fund for this purpose, as specified.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","An act to amend Section 85300 of, and to add Section 89519.5 to, the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."

Before adopting new boundaries, the commission shall hold at least three public hearings preceding the hearing at which the new boundaries are adopted. The commission shall not draw districts for the purpose of favoring or discriminating against an incumbent or political candidate.","Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors to appoint a committee, composed of county residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its supervisorial districts. Existing law directs a committee created pursuant to that provision to report its findings to the board of supervisors, as specified, and it expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only. Existing law similarly authorizes a city council to appoint a committee, composed of city residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its council districts, directs a committee so created to report its findings to the city council, and expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only.
This bill would delete those provisions and instead authorize a county or general law city to establish a commission, composed of residents of the county or city, to either change the boundaries of the districts or recommend to the governing body changes to the boundaries of the districts. The bill would also require an advisory commission that recommends changes to district boundaries to report to the governing body its findings on the need for changes to the boundaries. For a commission empowered to change district boundaries, this bill would prohibit the appointment of a person or family member, as defined, of a person who engaged in specified activities during the preceding 8 years, and it would also prohibit commission members from engaging in specified activities while serving and for a specified period of time after serving.","An act to add Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 23000) to Division 21 of, and to repeal Sections 21505 and 21605 of, the Elections Code, relating to elections."

Services pursuant to this paragraph may include, but are not limited to, housing, medical care, child care, treatment for alcohol or substance abuse, nutritional counseling and treatment, psychological counseling, employment, and employment training and education.
(c)The Legislature finds and declares that a program similar to the LEAD program has been demonstrated in Seattle, Washington to lower recidivism of participants, increase cooperation by participants in treatment and related programs, and significantly reduce law enforcement and court costs.","Existing law authorizes a county to establish a pretrial diversion program for defendants who have been charged with a misdemeanor offense and authorizes other diversion programs, including for defendants with cognitive developmental disabilities, defendants in nonviolent drug cases, and traffic violations.
This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to approve three counties for the establishment of a Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program. The bill would require the LEAD pilot programs to authorize designated officers to take a person for whom the officer has probable cause for arrest for specified controlled substances offenses, including possession of a controlled substance or other prohibited substance, or prostitution, to treatment programs and services in lieu of that arrest.
This bill, until January 1, 2020, would establish the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program, to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections, to improve public safety and reduce recidivism by increasing the availability and use of social service resources while reducing costs to law enforcement agencies and courts stemming from repeated incarceration. The bill would require the board to award grants, on a competitive basis, to up to 3 jurisdictions to establish LEAD programs and would require the board to establish minimum standards, funding schedules, and procedures for awarding grants. The bill would establish requirements for referral of people who may be arrested for, or who have a history of, low-level drug offenses or prostitution, as defined, to social services in lieu of prosecution. The bill would require the board to contract with a nonprofit research entity, university, or college to evaluate the effectiveness of the LEAD program and submit a report of the findings to the Governor and the Legislature by January 1, 2020.","An act to add

The prohibition on park closures, pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 541.5, does not limit the department’s authority to enter into an operating agreement pursuant to this section, as provided in subdivision (e) of Section 541.5. The department may only enter into an operating agreement that involves the operation of the entirety of a park unit for no more than 20 park units.

(1) The district superintendent for the department shall provide liaison with the department, the nonprofit organization, and the public.
(2) The nonprofit organization shall annually submit a written report to the department regarding its operating activities during the prior year and shall make copies of the report available to the public upon request.

(3) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), all revenues that the qualified nonprofit organization receives from a unit shall be expended only for the care, maintenance, operation, administration, improvement, or development of the unit. The qualified nonprofit organization may additionally contribute in-kind services and funds raised from outside entities for the care, maintenance, operation, administration, improvement, or development of the unit.
(B) If the qualified nonprofit organization determines that the revenues it has received from a unit are in excess of the revenues that are needed for the care, maintenance, operation, administration, improvement, or development of that unit, and that these funds are not already specified for or committed to specific purposes pursuant to an existing agreement or contract restricting the use of those funds, the qualified nonprofit organization may dedicate those excess revenues to another state park unit for that unit’s care, maintenance, operation, administration, improvement, or development.
(4) General Fund moneys shall not be provided to a nonprofit organization to subsidize the operation or maintenance of a park unit. This paragraph applies to state parks, the full operation of which are turned over to a nonprofit organization, but does not apply to or preclude the department from entering into agreements with nonprofit organizations to operate a portion of a state park unit, or from entering into comanagement agreements with nonprofit organizations that involve the sharing of operational and financial responsibilities for the park unit and that have the effect of reducing state costs. This paragraph does not apply to park entrance fees, concession revenues, or any other revenues generated within a park operated by a nonprofit organization pursuant to this section.
(5) Jobs maintained under a memorandum of understanding between the state and the represented bargaining units shall not be eliminated pursuant to the agreement and shall continue to be state employment.

(c) An operating agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (a) shall specify the duties that the nonprofit organization shall be responsible for carrying out relative to management and protection of natural, historical, and cultural resources, and shall identify those management duties that shall continue to be conducted by the department, so that all core operations of the park are delineated. Scientific, architectural, and engineering functions that require special expertise or professional training shall only be conducted by or under the supervision of qualified persons with applicable expertise or training and subject to oversight by the department.
(d) This section does not supersede the requirements of Section 5019.53 regarding the protection of natural, scenic, cultural, and ecological values.
(e) The nonprofit organization and the district superintendent for the department shall, following submittal of the annual report pursuant to subdivision (a), hold a joint public meeting for discussion of the report.
(f) If the department intends to enter into an operating agreement for the development, improvement, restoration, care, maintenance, administration, or operation of a unit or units, or a portion of a unit, the department shall notify the Member of the Legislature in whose district the unit is located, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water, the Chair of the Assembly Committee on Water, Parks, and Wildlife, and the chairs of the Assembly and Senate budget committees of that intention. The notification shall include estimated operating costs and revenues and core duties and responsibilities that are likely to be assigned to the nonprofit organization and the department.
(g) For purposes of this section, a qualified nonprofit organization is an organization that is all of the following:
(1) An organization that is exempt from taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2) An organization that has as its principal purpose and activity to provide visitor services in state parks, facilitate public access to park resources, improve park facilities, provide interpretive and educational services, or provide direct protection or stewardship of natural, cultural, or historical lands, or resources.
(3) An organization that is in compliance with the Supervision of Trustees and Fundraisers for Charitable Purposes Act (Article 7 (commencing with Section 12580) of Chapter 6 of Part 2 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(h) (1) Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the department shall provide a report to the Legislature, on a biennial basis, of the status of operating agreements it has entered into pursuant to this section. The report shall include a list of units of the state park system with operating agreements, discussion of the management and operations of each unit subject to an operating agreement, an accounting of the revenues and expenditures incurred under each operating agreement, and an assessment of the benefit to the state from operating agreements entered into pursuant to this section.
(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(i) This section shall remain in effect until January 1, 2025, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2025, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law vests control of the state park system with the Department of Parks and Recreation and authorizes the department to enter into an operating agreement with a qualified nonprofit organization for the development, improvement, restoration, care, maintenance, administration, or operation of a unit or units, or portion of a unit, of the state park system, subject to certain conditions and requirements.

The bill would require the department to take specified actions relating to the development and implementation of such an agreement and would authorize the Director of Parks and Recreation and the Director of Finance, or their designees, to serve as ex officio, nonvoting members of the park support organization’s board of directors. The bill would require the department, if it enters into an agreement with a park support organization, to collaborate with the park support organization to develop an annual list of strategic initiatives and projects that are statewide priorities for the state park system and the park support organization and that the park support organization will undertake in partnership with the department. The bill would authorize the department to enter into supplementary agreements and leases, as provided, with the park support organization and receive donations of projects, services, and funds to be used for the support of the state park system, subject to the review and approval of the statewide agreement or substantial amendment of such an agreement by the Director of Finance.
Existing law authorizes the department to lease, for any use, all or any portion of any parcel of real property acquired for state park system purposes, if the director finds that the use would be compatible with the use of the real property as a unit or part of a unit and with the sound management and conservation of resources within the unit, but prohibits the department from entering into a lease that extends beyond 10 years unless certain conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease as part of the annual budget process are met. Existing law imposes similar review and approval requirements of operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $500,000 in annual gross revenues.
This bill would revise certain of those conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease or operating lease or agreement by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, as specified. The bill would make those conditions applicable only to operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $1,000,000 in annual gross revenues.","An act to amend Sections 5003.17 and 5080.40 of, to amend and repeal Section 5080.42 of, and to add Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 520) to Chapter 1 of Division 1 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to state parks."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that pilot projects are demonstrating that schools have significantly lower special education costs when schools partner with county-funded Medi-Cal mental health services providers to address the mental health problems of pupils in a comprehensive multitiered model that includes services for pupils at the earliest time, usually years before they would require special education, which can often be prevented. Thus, the Legislature encourages the partnerships authorized by this act to, whenever possible, look for opportunities and funding to provide pupils who do not have individualized education programs, but are in need of, and could benefit from, prevention and early intervention services, with those services. The Legislature further encourages the State Department of Education and the State Department of Health Care Services to work toward the development of protocols to identify students who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving educationally related mental health services as part of an individual educational plan for the purposes of data tracking.

Part 6 (commencing with Section 5920) is added to Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
PART 6. County and Local Educational Agency Partnerships
5920.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a county, or a qualified provider operating as part of the county mental health plan network, and a local educational agency may enter into a partnership that includes all of the following:
(1) The coum 0;"">(3) The local educational agency, with permission of the pupil’s parent, provides the county mental health plan provider with the information of the health insurance carrier for each pupil.
(4) The agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency addresses how to cover the costs of mental health provider services not covered by funds pursuant to paragraph (1) in the event that mental health service costs exceed the agreed-upon funding outlined in the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency following a yearend cost reconciliation process, and in the event that the local educational agency does not elect to provide the services through other means.
(5) The agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency fulfills reporting and all other requirements under state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.) and Medi-Cal EPSDT provisions, and measures the effect of the mental health intervention and how that intervention meets the goals in a pupil’s IEP or relevant plan for non-IEP pupils.
(6) The county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency participate in the performance outcome system established by the State Department of Health Care Services pursuant to Section 14707.5 to measure results of services provided under the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency.
(7) A plan to establish a partnership described in this section in at least one school within the local educational agency in the first year and to expand the partnership to three additional schools within three years.
(b) For purposes of this section, “local educational agency” has the same meaning as that term is defined in Section 56026.3 of the Education Code.
(c) Where applicable, and to the extent mutually agreed to by a school district and a plan or insurer, it is the intent of the Legislature that a health care service plan or a health insurer be authorized to participate in the partnerships described in this part.
5921.
(a) The County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund is hereby created in the State Treasury. Moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the State Department of Education for the purpose of funding the partnerships described in this part. The State Department of Education shall fund partnerships described in this part through a competitive grant program.
(b) (1) For the 2017–18 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, to the extent there is an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or another measure for purposes of this part, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall allocate funds from that appropriation to the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.
(2) Other funds identified and appropriated by the Legislature may also be deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund and used for the purposes specified in subdivision (a).
(c) Funds made available in the annual Budget Act for the purpose of providing educationally related mental health services, including out-of-home residential services for emotionally disturbed pupils, required by an individualized education program, shall be used only for that purpose and shall not be deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.","Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and special education local plan areas (SELPAs) to comply with state laws that conform to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, in order that the state may qualify for federal funds available for the education of individuals with exceptional needs. Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and SELPAs to identify, locate, and assess individuals with exceptional needs and to provide those pupils with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, and with special education and related services, including mental health services, as reflected in an individualized education program.
Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs.
This bill would specifically authorize a county, or a qualified provider operating as part of the county mental health plan network, and a local educational agency to enter into a partnership that includes, among other things, an agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency that establishes a Medi-Cal mental health provider that is county operated or county contracted for the provision of mental health services to pupils of the local educational agency and in which there are provisions for the delivery of campus-based mental health services through qualified providers or qualified professionals to provide on-campus support to identify pupils with a specified education plan and pupils not in special education who a teacher believes may require those services and, with parental consent, to provide mental health services to those pupils. The bill would create the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund in the State Treasury, which would be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the State Department of Education for the purpose of funding these partnerships, as specified, and would require the State Department of Education to fund these partnerships through a competitive grant program.
The bill would require funds made available in the annual Budget Act for the purpose of providing educationally related mental health services required by an individualized education program to be used only for that purpose and would prohibit those funds from being deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.","An act to add Part 6 (commencing with Section 5920) to Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to pupil health."

SECTION 1.
Section 3605 of the Probate Code is amended to read:
3605.
(a) This section applies only to a special needs trust established under Section 3604 on or after January 1, 1993.
(b) While the special needs trust is in existence, the statute of limitations otherwise applicable to claims of the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of State Hospitals, the State Department of Developmental Services, and any county or city and county in this state is tolled. Notwithstanding any provision in the trust instrument, at the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or on termination of the trust, the trust property is subject to claims of the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of State Hospitals, the State Department of Developmental Services, and any county or city and county in this state to the extent authorized by law as if the trust property is owned by the beneficiary or is part of the beneficiary’s estate.
(c) At the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or on termination of the trust, the trustee shall give notice of the beneficiary’s death or the trust termination, in the manner provided in Section 1215, to all of the following:
(1) The State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of State Hospitals, and the State Department of Developmental Services, addressed to the director of that department at the Sacramento office of the director.
(2) Any county or city and county in this state that has made a written request to the trustee for notice, addressed to that county or city and county at the address specified in the request.
(d) Failure to give the notice required by subdivision (c) prevents the running of the statute of limitations against the claim of the department, county, or city and county not given the notice.
(e) The department, county, or city and county has four months after notice is given in which to make a claim with the trustee. If the trustee rejects the claim, the department, county, or city and county making the claim may petition the court for an order under Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 5 of Division 9, directing the trustee to pay the claim. A claim made under this subdivision shall be paid as a preferred claim prior to any other distribution. If trust property is insufficient to pay all claims under this subdivision, the trustee shall petition the court for instructions and the claims shall be paid from trust property as the court deems just.
(f) If trust property is distributed before expiration of four months after notice is given without payment of the claim, the department, county, or city and county has a claim against the distributees to the full extent of the claim, or each distributee’s share of trust property, whichever is less. The claim against distributees includes interest at a rate equal to that earned in the Pooled Money Investment Account, Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 16480) of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code, from the date of distribution or the date of filing the claim, whichever is later, plus other accruing costs as in the case of enforcement of a money judgment.
(g) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (f), inclusive, the trust property of the deceased beneficiary of a special needs trust is not subject to the claims of the state and local entities described in subdivision (b) if there is a surviving child who is a sibling of a deceased beneficiary, that surviving child is also the beneficiary of a special needs trust, and the trust of the deceased beneficiary provides for the transfer of the property in the trust of the deceased beneficiary to the special needs trust of the surviving sibling.

14009.5.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the department shall claim against the estate of the decedent, or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival an amount equal to the payments for the health care services received or the value of the property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution or survival, whichever is less.
(b) The department may not claim in any of the following circumstances:
(1) The decedent was under 55 when services were received, except in the case of an individual who had been an inpatient in a nursing facility.
(2)
Where
If
there is any of the following:
(A) A surviving spouse during his or her lifetime. However, upon the death of a surviving spouse, the department shall make a claim against the estate of the surviving spouse, or against any recipient of property from the surviving spouse obtained by distribution or survival, for either the amount paid for the medical assistance given to the decedent or the value of any of the decedent’s property received by the surviving spouse through distribution or survival, whichever is less. Any statute of limitations that purports to limit the ability to recover for medical assistance granted under this chapter shall not apply to any claim made for reimbursement.
(B) A surviving child who is under age 21.
(C) A surviving child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled, within the meaning of Section 1614 of the federal Social Security Act (42
U.S.C.A.
U.S.C.
Sec. 1382c).
(D) A surviving child who is the beneficiary of a special needs trust, and who is a sibling of a deceased beneficiary of a special needs trust, if the special needs trust of the deceased beneficiary provides for the transfer of the property in the trust of the deceased beneficiary to the special needs trust of the surviving sibling.
(3) Any exemption described in paragraph (2) that restricts the department from filing a claim against a decedent’s property shall apply only to the proportionate share of the decedent’s estate or property that passes to those recipients, by survival or distribution, who qualify for an exemption under paragraph (2).
(c) (1) The department shall waive its claim, in whole or in part, if it determines that enforcement of the claim would result in substantial hardship to other dependents, heirs, or survivors of the individual against whose estate the claim exists.
(2) The department shall notify individuals of the waiver provision and the opportunity for a hearing to establish that a waiver should be granted.
(d) The following definitions shall govern the construction of this section:
(1) “Decedent” means a beneficiary who has received health care under this chapter or Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 14200) and who has died leaving property to others either through distribution or survival.
(2) “Dependents” includes, but is not limited to, immediate family or blood relatives of the decedent.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing federal law provides that assets in specified trusts shall not be considered for the purposes of determining an individual’s eligibility for, or amount of, benefits under Medicaid but provides that the state shall receive all amounts remaining in those trusts upon the death of the trust beneficiary. Existing state law provides that while a special needs trust, as specified, is in existence, the statute of limitations otherwise applicable to claims of the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Mental Health, the State Department of Developmental Services, and any county or city and county is tolled and that the trust property is subject to those claims at the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or on termination of the trust.
This bill would exempt from the claims of those entities the trust property of a deceased beneficiary if there is a surviving child who is a sibling of the deceased beneficiary, that surviving child is also the beneficiary of a special needs trust, and the trust of the deceased beneficiary provides for the transfer of the property in the trust of the deceased beneficiary to the special needs trust of the surviving sibling.","An act to amend Section 3605 of the Probate Code, and to amend Section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public social service."

(c) Any allegation that the prosecution knew or should have known of the false nature of the evidence referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b) is immaterial to the prosecution of a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b).
(d) This section does not limit the grounds for which a writ of habeas corpus may be prosecuted or preclude the use of any other remedies.
(e) (1) For purposes of this section, “false evidence” includes opinions of experts that have either been repudiated by the expert who originally provided the opinion at a hearing or trial or that have been undermined by later scientific research or technological advances.
(2) This section does not create additional liabilities, beyond those already recognized, for an expert who repudiates his or her original opinion provided at a hearing or trial or whose opinion has been undermined by later scientific research or technological advancements.

Section 1485.5 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1485.5.
(a) If the district attorney or Attorney General stipulates to or does not contest the factual allegations underlying one or more of the grounds for granting a writ of habeas corpus or a motion to vacate a judgment, the facts underlying the basis for the court’s ruling or order shall be binding on the Attorney General, the factfinder, and the California Victim Compensation Board.
(b) The district attorney shall provide notice to the Attorney General prior to entering into a stipulation of facts that will be the basis for the granting of a writ of habeas corpus or a motion to vacate a judgment.
(c) In a contested or uncontested proceeding, the express factual findings made by the court, including credibility determinations, in considering a petition for habeas corpus, a motion to vacate judgment pursuant to Section 1473.6, or an application for a certificate of factual innocence, shall be binding on the Attorney General, the factfinder, and the California Victim Compensation Board.
(d) For the purposes of this section, “express factual findings” are findings established as the basis for the court’s ruling or order.
(e) For purposes of this section, “court” is defined as a state or federal court.

Section 1485.55 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1485.55.
(a) In a contested proceeding, if the court has granted a writ of habeas corpus or when, pursuant to Section 1473.6, the court vacates a judgment, and if the court has found that the person is factually innocent, that finding shall be binding on the California Victim Compensation Board for a claim presented to the board, and upon application by the person, the board shall, without a hearing, recommend to the Legislature that an appropriation be made and the claim paid pursuant to Section 4904.
(b) In a contested or uncontested proceeding, if the court grants a writ of habeas corpus and did not find the person factually innocent in the habeas corpus proceedings, the petitioner may move for a finding of factual innocence by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime with which he or she was charged was either not committed at all or, if committed, was not committed by him or her.
(c) If the court vacates a judgment pursuant to Section 1473.6, on any ground, the petitioner may move for a finding of factual innocence by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime with which he or she was charged was either not committed at all or, if committed, was not committed by him or her.
(d) If the court makes a finding that the petitioner has proven his or her factual innocence by a preponderance of the evidence pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c), the board shall, without a hearing, recommend to the Legislature that an appropriation be made and any claim filed shall be paid pursuant to Section 4904.
(e) A presumption does not exist in any other proceeding for failure to make a motion or obtain a favorable ruling pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c).
(f) If a federal court, after granting a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to a nonstatutory motion or request, finds a petitioner factually innocent by no less than a preponderance of the evidence that the crime with which he or she was charged was either not committed at all or, if committed, was not committed by him or her, the board shall, without a hearing, recommend to the Legislature that an appropriation be made and any claim filed shall be paid pursuant to Section 4904.","Existing law allows every person who is unlawfully imprisoned or restrained of his or her liberty to prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of his or her imprisonment or restraint. Existing law allows a writ of habeas corpus to be prosecuted for, but not limited to, false evidence that is substantially material or probative to the issue of guilt or punishment that was introduced at trial and false physical evidence which was a material factor directly related to the plea of guilty of the person.
This bill would additionally allow a writ of habeas corpus to be prosecuted on the basis of new evidence that is credible, material, presented without substantial delay, and of such decisive force and value that it would have more likely than not changed the outcome at trial.
Existing law requires the California Victim Compensation Board to recommend an appropriation be made by the Legislature for the purpose of indemnifying a person if the evidence shows that a crime with which the person was charged was either not committed at all, or, if committed, was not committed by that person. Existing law requires that the appropriation recommended shall be a sum equivalent to $140 per day of incarceration served. If a court grants a writ of habeas corpus or vacates a judgment on the basis of new evidence and finds that the new evidence points unerringly to innocence, existing law requires the board to recommend an appropriation to the Legislature pursuant to these provisions without a hearing.
This bill would require the board, without a hearing, to recommend an appropriation to the Legislature if the court finds that the person is factually innocent. The bill would make additional clarifying and technical changes.","An act to amend Sections 1473, 1485.5, and 1485.55 of the Penal Code, relating to habeas corpus."

Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires each department to develop and adopt regulations to ensure that enrollees have access to needed health care services in a timely manner.
Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law requires each prepaid health plan to establish a grievance procedure under which enrollees may submit their grievances.
This bill would require a health care service plan contract or a health insurance policy that provides benefits through contracts with providers for alternative rates that is issued, renewed, or amended on or after July 1, 2017, to provide information to enrollees and insureds regarding the standards for timely access to health care services and other specified health care access information, including information related to receipt of interpreter services in a timely manner, no less than annually, and would make these provisions applicable to Medi-Cal managed care plans. The bill would also require a health care service plan or a health insurer that contracts with providers for alternative rates of payment to provide a contracting health care provider with specified information relating to the provision of referrals or health care services in a timely manner.
Because a willful violation of the bill’s provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

319,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature hereby declares all of the following:
(a) Beginning in 2008, California faced a foreclosure crisis, with rapidly dropping home values and skyrocketing job losses. Indiscriminate foreclosure practices of major mortgage servicers compounded the problem as they created a labyrinth of red tape, lost documents, and erroneous information, and then they started foreclosure proceedings while borrowers and their families were in the middle of applying for a loan modification.
(b) The California Legislature responded with a first-in-the-nation Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR), which requires mortgage servicers to provide borrowers a fair and transparent process, a single point of contact, and the opportunity to finish applying for a loan modification before foreclosure proceedings can start. HBOR stabilized families, neighborhoods, and local communities by slowing down indiscriminate foreclosures.
(c) Now, however, district attorneys and legal aid organizations are reporting an increasing number of cases in which mortgage servicers use a loophole in HBOR to foreclose on certain homeowners—people who survive the death of a borrower and have an ownership interest in the home but are not named on the mortgage loan. Most often, the “survivor” is the borrower’s spouse and is over 65 years of age.
(d) When the surviving widow or widower, domestic partner, children, or other heirs attempt to obtain basic information about the loan from the servicer, they face the same kind of barriers and abuses—and, finally foreclosure—that convinced the Legislature to pass HBOR.
(e) Home ownership is the primary avenue for most Americans to build generational wealth. Indiscriminate foreclosures on surviving heirs destroy a family’s ability to build for its financial future. Foreclosures also exacerbate the racial wealth gap—and overall wealth inequality—in society, and force seniors who want to “age in place” into the overheated rental market instead, with devastating health impacts.
(f) Surviving heirs deserve the same transparency and opportunity to save their home as HBOR gave the original borrower. This act would stem a disturbing nationwide trend and help keep widows and widowers, children, and other survivors in their homes—without requiring mortgage servicers to do anything more than they already do for other homeowners.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that this act work in conjunction with federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau servicing guidelines.
SEC. 2.
Section 2920.7 is added to the Civil Code, to read:
2920.7.
(a) Upon notification by someone claiming to be a successor in interest that a borrower has died, and where that claimant is not a party to the loan or promissory note, a mortgage servicer shall not record a notice of default pursuant to Section 2924 until the mortgage servicer does both of the following:
(1) Requests reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower from the claimant, including, but not limited to, a death certificate or other written evidence of the death of the borrower. A reasonable period of time shall be provided for the claimant to present this documentation, but no less than 30 days from the date of a written request by the mortgage servicer.
(2) Requests reasonable documentation from the claimant demonstrating the ownership interest of that claimant in the real property. A reasonable period of time shall be provided for the claimant to present this documentation, but no less than 90 days from the date of a written request by the mortgage servicer.
(b) (1) Upon receipt by the mortgage servicer of the reasonable documentation of the status of a claimant as successor in interest and that claimant’s ownership interest in the real property, that claimant shall be deemed a “successor in interest.”
(2) There may be more than one successor in interest. A mortgage servicer shall apply the provisions of this section to multiple successors in interest in accordance with the terms of the loan and federal and state laws and regulations. When there are multiple successors in interest who do not wish to proceed as coborrowers or coapplicants, a mortgage servicer may require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for loan assumption.
(3) Being a successor in interest under this section does not impose an affirmative duty on a mortgage servicer or alter any obligation the mortgage servicer has to provide a loan modification to the successor in interest. If a successor in interest assumes the loan, he or she may be required to otherwise qualify for available foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the mortgage servicer.
(c) Within 10 days of a claimant being deemed a successor in interest pursuant to subdivision (b), a mortgage servicer shall provide the successor in interest with information in writing about the loan. This information shall include, at a minimum, loan balance, interest rate and interest reset dates and amounts, balloon payments if any, prepayment penalties if any, default or delinquency status, the monthly payment amount, and payoff amounts.
(d) A mortgage servicer shall allow a successor in interest to either:
(1) Apply to assume the deceased borrower’s loan. The mortgage servicer may evaluate the creditworthiness of the successor in interest, subject to applicable investor requirements and guidelines.
(2) If a successor in interest of an assumable loan also seeks a foreclosure prevention alternative, simultaneously apply to assume the loan and for a foreclosure prevention alternative that may be offered by, or available through, the mortgage loan servicer. If the successor in interest qualifies for the foreclosure prevention alternative, assume the loan. The mortgage servicer may evaluate the creditworthiness of the successor in interest subject to applicable investor requirements and guidelines.
(e) (1) A successor in interest shall have all the same rights and remedies as a borrower under subdivision (a) of Section 2923.4 and under Sections 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, 2924.12, 2924.15, 2924.17, 2924.18, and 2924.19. For the purposes of Section 2924.15, “owner-occupied” means that the property was the principal residence of the deceased borrower and is security for a loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.
(2) If a trustee’s deed upon sale has not been recorded, a successor in interest may bring an action for injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), or (d). Any injunction shall remain in place and any trustee’s sale shall be enjoined until the court determines that the mortgage servicer has corrected and remedied the violation or violations giving rise to the action for injunctive relief. An enjoined entity may move to dissolve an injunction based on a showing that the material violation has been corrected and remedied.
(3) After a trustee’s deed upon sale has been recorded, a mortgage servicer shall be liable to a successor in interest for actual economic damages pursuant to Section 3281 resulting from a material violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), or (d) by that mortgage servicer if the violation was not corrected and remedied prior to the recordation of the trustee’s deed upon sale.

Existing law gives a borrower, as defined, various rights and remedies against a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, and authorized agent in regards to foreclosure prevention alternatives, as defined, including loan modifications, which is commonly referred to as being part of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights. Existing law defines a mortgage servicer as a person or entity who directly services a loan, or is responsible for interacting with the borrower, and managing the loan account on a daily basis, as specified.
This bill until January 1, 2020, would prohibit a mortgage servicer, upon notification that a borrower has died, from recording a notice of default until the mortgage servicer does certain things, including requesting reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower from a claimant, who is someone claiming to be a successor in interest, who is not a party to the loan or promissory note and providing a reasonable period of time for the claimant to present the requested documentation. The bill would deem a claimant a successor in interest, as defined, upon receipt by a mortgage servicer of the reasonable documentation regarding the status of the claimant as a successor in interest and the claimant’s ownership interest in the real property.
The bill would require a mortgage servicer, within 10 days of a claimant being deemed a successor in interest, to provide the successor in interest with information about the loan, as specified. The bill would require a mortgage servicer to allow a successor in interest to assume the deceased borrower’s loan or to apply for foreclosure prevention alternatives on an assumable loan, as specified. The bill would authorize a mortgage servicer, when there are multiple successors in interest who do not wish to proceed as coborrowers or coapplicants, to require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for a loan assumption. The bill would provide that a successor in interest, as specified, who assumes an assumable loan and wishes to apply for a foreclosure prevention alternative has the same rights and remedies as a borrower under specified provisions of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights. The bill would authorize a successor in interest to bring an action for injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of specified provisions of law and would authorize a court to award a prevailing successor in interest reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for the action. The bill would define terms for these purposes and make various findings and declarations. The bill would deem a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, or beneficiary of the deed of trust, or an agent thereof, to be in compliance with the above-described provisions if they comply with specified federal laws. The bill would exempt certain depository institutions and persons from these provisions, as specified.","An act to add Section 2920.7 to the Civil Code, relating to mortgages and deeds of trust."

321,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In 2011, the State of California passed historic legislation to reduce recidivism in the state prison system by supervising people with low-level convictions at the local level, closer to their communities. To support realignment efforts, the state has provided approximately $2.5 billion in funding for local jail construction projects, including:
(1) One billion two hundred million dollars ($1,200,000,000) in funding for local jail construction projects authorized by Chapter 7 of the Statutes of 2007. In two phases of the program, 21 counties received awards. When all construction is completed, over 9,000 jail beds will have been added.
(2) Five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in funding for local jails authorized by Chapter 42 of the Statutes of 2012. The Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) awarded 14 counties funding. The program specified that counties seeking to replace or upgrade outdated facilities and provide alternatives to incarceration, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment, would be considered.
(3) An additional $500 million for local jails authorized by Chapter 37 of the Statutes of 2014. The BSCC awarded 15 counties funding. This funding was primarily available for improving existing capacity and treatment and programming space.
(4) An additional $250 million for local jails and an additional $20 million specifically for Napa County authorized by Chapter 34 of the Statutes of 2016. The funding was limited to those counties that had not been fully funded through previous grants. In addition, a facility constructed or renovated with program funding is required to include space for in-person visitation and a county applying for financing is required to submit a description of efforts to address sexual abuse in its jails.
(b) While a number of the counties that were awarded funding under the programs described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subdivision (a) are offering in-person visitation, there are several that have banned, or are considering banning, in-person visitation and instead offering only video visitation.
(c) Experts have found “that prison visitation can significantly improve the transition incarcerated people make from the institution to the community.” Just one visit “reduced the risk of recidivism by 13 percent for felony reconvictions and 25 percent for technical violation revocations.” “[M]ore frequent and recent visits were associated with a decreased risk of recidivism,” and “the more sources of social support an incarcerated person has, the lower the risk of recidivism.”
(d) Experts have additionally found that video “[v]isiting cannot replicate seeing someone in-person, and it is critical for a young child to visit his or her incarcerated parent in person to establish a secure attachment.”
(e) For purposes of updating and promulgating regulations, the BSCC utilizes the 2015 Adult Titles 15 and 24 Regulation Revision Executive Steering Committee (ESC). The ESC, which is responsible for regulations relating to visitation, requested that one of its working groups discuss the current visitation regulations as they relate to video visitation. Despite expert findings, the BSCC working group on visitation, which was comprised of only law enforcement representatives, stated, in part: “The workgroup engaged in a lengthy discussion regarding video visitation versus in-person visits. Several members of the group reported that their county is planning or building new facilities with space for video visiting only (no space for in-person visits).”
(f) Chapter 15 of the Statutes of 2011, the public safety realignment legislation, included the following legislative findings: “Realigning low-level felony offenders who do not have prior convictions for serious, violent, or sex offenses to locally run, community-based corrections programs which are strengthened through community-based punishment, evidence-based practices, improved supervision strategies, and enhanced secured capacity, will improve public safety outcomes among adult felons and facilitate their reintegration back into society.”
(g) Due to the enactment of realignment legislation, more people are serving lengthy jail sentences for felony convictions, often years and, in some cases, decades.
(h) California’s criminal justice realignment will be strengthened by ensuring that incarcerated people at the local level have contact with, and build meaningful connections with, friends and family in their communities. With these connections, incarcerated people will be better prepared to successfully reintegrate into and contribute to society.
SEC. 2.
Section 4032 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
4032.
(a) A local detention facility that elects to utilize video or other types of electronic devices for inmate visitations shall also provide inmates with in-person visitation that meets or surpasses the minimum number of weekly visits required by regulations of the Board of State and Community Corrections for persons detained in the facility. For purposes of this section, “local detention facility” has the same meaning as defined in Section 6031.4.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a local detention facility that elects to utilize video or other types of electronic devices for inmate visitations and does not have existing space available for in-person visitation shall provide visitation in accordance with subdivision (a) no later than January 1, 2022.","Existing law provides that a county jail is kept by the sheriff of the county in which the jail is situated and is to be used for specified purposes, including for the confinement of persons sentenced to imprisonment in a county jail upon a criminal conviction. Existing regulations of the Board of State and Community Corrections specify the number of visits that inmates held in certain types of correctional facilities are required to be provided.
This bill would require a local detention facility, as defined, that elects to utilize video or other types of electronic devices for inmate visitations to also provide an inmate with in-person visitation that meets or surpasses the minimum number of weekly visits required by those regulations for a person detained in the facility. If a local detention facility does not have existing space available for in-person visitation, the bill would require the facility to comply no later than January 1, 2022.","An act to add Section 4032 to the Penal Code, relating to incarcerated persons."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because this act implements a federal law or regulation and results in costs mandated by the federal government, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing federal law establishes nutritional standards for all food and beverages other than meals reimbursed under programs authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 available for sale to pupils on the school campus during the schoolday.
Existing state law establishes nutritional standards for all food and beverages sold or served to pupils in elementary, middle, and high school.
This bill would enact the Healthy Food, Healthy Student Act to update state law regarding school nutritional standards to conform to the federal standards. To the extent these changes would impose new duties on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires every public school to post the school district’s nutrition and physical activity policies in public view within all school cafeterias or other central eating areas.
This bill would, instead, require every public school to inform the public about the content of the school’s local school wellness policy, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Sections 49430, 49430.5, 49430.7, 49431, 49431.2, 49431.5, 49431.7, and 49432 of the Education Code, relating to pupil nutrition."

PARCEL 1
COMMENCING at point “A” as shown on the Map of the Grant to the City of Albany, recorded July 24, 1963, in Book 43 of Maps, page 12A, Alameda County Records, said point “A” having California Zone 2 coordinates of x = 1,469,703.82 feet and y = 511,851.40 feet, thence along the northerly boundary of said Grant S 74° 21’ 53” E, 2573.92 feet to point “B” as shown on said map and being the TRUE POINT OF BEGINNING, thence continuing along the boundary of said grant the following ten courses:

All of that certain parcel of land described as Parcel 1 in deed to the City of Albany, recorded January 15, 1942, in Liber 4159, page 296, Alameda County Records.
SEC. 11.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district are the result of a program for which legislative authority was requested by that local agency or school district, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code and Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law grants in trust to the City of Albany certain designated tidelands and submerged lands, both filled and unfilled, for specified uses. The grant, among other things, requires that those lands be used in conformity with the Albany Waterfront Plan and be improved in accordance with the plan on or before January 1, 1988, or title therein shall revert to the state. Existing law imposes various requirements regarding public rights in the granted lands, leasing of lands by the city, management and disposition of revenues from the lands, and the determination of boundaries of the lands granted that are subject to the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Existing law requires 85% of excess trust revenues, as specified, to be transmitted to the Treasurer and deposited in the General Fund.
This bill would delete those provisions and instead require that, on and after January 1, 2022, the use of those trust lands, as described, conform to an approved trust lands use plan, prescribed by the bill, and all leases or agreements proposed or entered into by the City of Albany, as trustee of those lands, also be consistent with the public trust doctrine, as defined, and conform to the plan. The bill would require the trustee, on or before September 30, 2022, and on or before September 30 of every succeeding 5th year thereafter, to submit a report to the State Lands Commission. By imposing new duties on a local government with regard to providing for the use and management of those trust lands, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Kapiloff Land Bank Act, creates the Land Bank Fund and continuously appropriates money in the fund, subject to a statutory trust, to the State Lands Commission, acting as the Land Bank Trustee, to acquire real property or any interest in real property for the purposes of public trust settlements.
The bill would require on June 30, 2021, and at the end of every fiscal year thereafter, that 20% of all gross revenue generated from the City of Albany trust lands be transmitted to the commission and, of this amount transmitted, would require the commission to allocate 80% to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund and 20% for deposit in the Land Bank Fund for expenditure by the commission pursuant to the act, thereby making an appropriation.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to repeal Chapter 211 of the Statutes of 1919, relating to tidelands and submerged lands in the Bay of San Francisco, and making an appropriation therefor."

The physician shall submit a report to the employer within five working days from the date of the initial examination, as required by Section 6409, and shall submit periodic reports at intervals that may be prescribed by rules and regulations adopted by the administrative director.
(2) If the employer objects to the employee’s selection of the physician on the grounds that the physician is not within the medical provider network used by the employer, and there is a final determination that the employee was entitled to select the physician pursuant to Section 4600, the employee shall be entitled to continue treatment with that physician at the employer’s expense in accordance with this division, notwithstanding Section 4616.2. The employer shall be required to pay from the date of the initial examination if the physician’s report was submitted within five working days of the initial examination. If the physician’s report was submitted more than five working days after the initial examination, the employer and the employee shall not be required to pay for any services prior to the date the physician’s report was submitted.
(3) If the employer objects to the employee’s selection of the physician on the grounds that the physician is not within the medical provider network used by the employer, and there is a final determination that the employee was not entitled to select a physician outside of the medical provider network, the employer shall have no liability for treatment provided by or at the direction of that physician or for any consequences of the treatment obtained outside the network.

An employer’s liability to a physician or another provider under this section for delayed payments shall not affect its liability to an employee under Section 5814 or any other provision of this division.

SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Public Cemetery District Law, specifies the procedures for the formation of public cemetery districts, procedures for the selection of the district board of trustees and officers, and the powers and duties of the board. Existing law authorizes a public cemetery district to sell “interment rights,” defined as the right to use or control the use of a plot, niche, or other space in a public cemetery district for interment of human remains. Existing law provides for the succession of an interment plot in a private cemetery.
This bill would modify the definition of “interment rights” to, among other things, specify that those rights are a transferable property interest held by the owner to determine, among other things, the number and identity of any person or persons to be interred in the plot within a public cemetery. The bill would require the owner of an interment right, at the time of purchase, to designate a successor owner or owners in a signed written designation deposited with the cemetery district. The bill would provide that the intestate order of succession would apply, if the owner dies without making that written designation or a valid and enforceable disposition of the interment right by a specific devise in a testamentary device. The bill would also require the public cemetery district to follow specified procedures in the event that the owner dies with no heirs at law.
The bill also would provide the circumstances and process under which human remains may be disinterred, reinterred, or removed from a public cemetery district after interment, and would specify the records required to be maintained by the public cemetery district and the person removing and relocating the human remains. The bill would require a person who purports to be the successor owner of an interment right to execute a written affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that includes specified information regarding his or her claim of successorship, and would provide that a district or district employee or trustee is not liable for claims, losses, or damages resulting from transferring an interment right in reliance on that affidavit, except as provided.
By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury and imposing new duties on public cemetery districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Section 9002 of, and to add Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 9069.10) to Part 4 of Division 8 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to cemeteries."

The detailed medical findings resulting from an inspection of the body or autopsy by an examining licensed physician and surgeon shall be either reduced to writing or permanently preserved on recording discs or other similar recording media, shall include all positive and negative findings pertinent to establishing the cause of death in accordance with medicolegal practice and this, along with the written opinions and conclusions of the examining licensed physician and surgeon, shall be included in the coroner’s record of the death. The coroner shall have the right to retain only those tissues of the body removed at the time of the autopsy as may, in his or her opinion, be necessary or advisable to the inquiry into the case, or for the verification of his or her findings. Only individuals who are directly involved in the investigation of the death of the decedent may be present during the performance of the autopsy.
(b) In any case in which the coroner knows, or has reason to believe, that the deceased has made valid provision for the disposition of his or her body or a part or parts thereof for medical or scientific purposes in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 7150) of Part 1 of Division 7 of the Health and Safety Code, the coroner shall neither perform nor authorize any other person to perform an autopsy on the body unless the coroner has contacted or attempted to contact the physician last in attendance to the deceased. If the physician cannot be contacted, the coroner shall then notify or attempt to notify one of the following of the need for an autopsy to determine the cause of death: (1) the surviving spouse; (2) a surviving child or parent; (3) a surviving brother or sister; (4) any other kin or person who has acquired the right to control the disposition of the remains. Following a period of 24 hours after attempting to contact the physician last in attendance and notifying or attempting to notify one of the responsible parties listed above, the coroner may authorize the performance of an autopsy, as otherwise authorized or required by law.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the discretion of the coroner to cause to be conducted an autopsy upon any victim of sudden, unexpected, or unexplained death or any death known or suspected of resulting from an accident, suicide, or apparent criminal means, or other death, as described in Section 27491.

(b) The Legislature finds and declares that sudden infant death syndrome, also referred to as SIDS, is the leading cause of death for children under age one, striking one out of every 500 children. The Legislature finds and declares that sudden infant death syndrome is a serious problem within the State of California, and that the public interest is served by research and study of sudden infant death syndrome and its potential causes and indications.
(c) (1) To facilitate these purposes, the coroner shall, within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as feasible, cause an autopsy to be performed in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly.

(2) If, before beginning the procedure, the coroner is informed by a relative or a friend of the decedent that the decedent had executed a certificate of religious belief, the coroner shall not order an autopsy to be performed, except as otherwise provided in this section, for 48 hours. If the certificate is produced within 48 hours, the case shall be governed by this section. If the certificate is not produced within that time, the case shall be governed by the other provisions of this article.
(b) Any person, 18 years of age or older, may execute a certificate of religious belief which shall state in clear and unambiguous language that any postmortem anatomical dissection or that specified procedures would violate the religious convictions of the person.

Notice of the proceeding shall be given to the person who produced the certificate. The proceeding shall have preference over all other cases.
(2) The court shall set aside the certificate if it finds that the certificate was not properly executed or that it does not clearly state the decedent’s religious objection to the proposed procedure.
(3) The court may order an autopsy or other procedure despite a valid certificate if it finds that the cause of death is not evident, and that the interest of the public in determining the cause of death outweighs its interest in permitting the decedent and like persons fully to exercise their religious convictions.
(4) Any procedure performed pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be the least intrusive procedure consistent with the order of the court.
(5) If the petition is denied, and no stay is granted, the body of the deceased shall immediately be released to the person authorized to control its disposition.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires a county coroner to inquire into and determine the circumstances, manner, and cause of certain deaths. Existing law either requires or authorizes a county coroner, under certain circumstances, to perform, or cause to be performed, an autopsy on a decedent. Existing law imposes certain requirements on a postmortem examination or autopsy conducted at the discretion of a coroner, medical examiner, or other agency upon an unidentified body or human remains. Existing law requires the coroner to perform an autopsy pursuant to a standardized protocol developed by the State Department of Public Health in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly.
Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county to consolidate the duties of certain county offices in one or more of specified combinations, including, but not limited to, sheriff and coroner, district attorney and coroner, and public administrator and coroner. Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county to abolish the office of coroner and provide instead for the office of medical examiner, as specified, and requires the medical examiner to be a licensed physician and surgeon duly qualified as a specialist in pathology.
This bill would require that a forensic autopsy, as defined, be conducted by a licensed physician and surgeon. The bill would require that the results of a forensic autopsy be determined by a licensed physician and surgeon. The bill would require the manner of death to be determined by the coroner or medical examiner of a county. The bill would authorize trained county personnel who are necessary to the performance of an autopsy to take body measurements or retrieve blood, urine, or vitreous samples from the body of a decedent at the direction and supervision of a coroner, a medical examiner, or a licensed physician and surgeon.

The bill would require the coroner to conduct an evaluation pursuant to a standardized protocol developed by the State Department of Public Health in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly.
The bill would require, for health and safety purposes, that all persons in the autopsy suite be informed of the risks presented by bloodborne pathogens and be informed that they should wear personal protective equipment, as specified. The bill would require that only individuals who are directly involved in the investigation of the death of the decedent be allowed into the autopsy suite but would permit individuals to be in the autopsy suite for educational and research purposes at the discretion of the coroner, in consultation with any licensed physician and surgeon conducting an autopsy. The bill would prohibit law enforcement personnel directly involved in the death of an individual who died due to involvement of law enforcement activity from being involved with any portion of the postmortem examination or being inside the autopsy suite during the performance of the autopsy. The bill would define a postmortem examination for this purpose to be the external examination of the body where no manner or cause of death is determined.
The bill would require specified materials that are in the possession of law enforcement and are related to a death that is incident to law enforcement activity to be made available to the physician and surgeon who conducts the autopsy prior to the completion of the investigation of the death.
The bill would specify that these provisions shall not be construed to limit the practice of an autopsy for educational or research purposes.
By imposing additional duties upon local officials and law enforcement agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
The bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 27491.4, 27491.41, 27491.43, 27491.46, 27491.47, and 27520 of, and to add Section 27522 to, the Government Code, relating to autopsies."

SECTION 1.
Section 5273.1 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:
5273.1.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 5273 and the dissolution of a state redevelopment agency, and subject to subdivision (b), for purposes of this section, an advertising display location that advertised businesses and activities within the boundary limits of the City of Inglewood may continue to exist and advertise businesses or activities operating outside the redevelopment project area. It shall be considered an on-premises display, as defined in Section 5490, if the advertising display meets all of the following conditions:
(1) The advertising display is located within the boundary limits of the City of Inglewood.
(2) The advertising display was constructed on or before January 1, 2012.
(3) The advertising display is adjacent to Interstate 405 and located at either postmile 22.36L or 22.38L north of Century Boulevard.
(4) The advertising display does not cause the reduction of federal aid highway funds provided pursuant to Section 131 of Title 23 of the United States Code. If an advertising display authorized under this section is subject to a notice from the United States Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, or any other applicable federal agency to the state that the operation of that display will result in the reduction of federal aid highway funds as provided in Section 131 of Title 23 of the United States Code, the display owner or operator shall remove all advertising copy from the display within 60 days after the date the state notifies the owner or operator, and the City of Inglewood, by certified mail, of the receipt of the federal notice. Failure to remove the advertising copy pursuant to this paragraph shall result in a civil fine, imposed by the California Department of Transportation, of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per day until the advertising copy is removed. The department shall not assume any liability in connection with the cessation of operation or removal of an advertising display or advertising copy pursuant to this paragraph. If the name of the owner or operator of the display is not indicated on the display, the state is only required to send the notice to the City of Inglewood.
(b) An advertising display described in subdivision (a) may remain until January 1, 2023, after which date the display shall be removed, unless it otherwise qualifies as a lawful advertising display pursuant to this section, without the payment of any compensation to the owner or operator. On and after January 1, 2022, the City of Inglewood may for good cause request from the department an extension beyond January 1, 2023, not to exceed the expiration of the redevelopment project area. “Good cause” for these purposes means that all of the following are satisfied: (1) there has been a finding by the City of Inglewood that the advertising display has had a positive economic impact on the redevelopment project area and provides a public benefit, (2) there have been no violations by the display owner or operator of this section or of any applicable illumination standards in the previous 10 years that have not been corrected within 30 days of the date of mailing of a violation notice to the owner or operator by the department, and (3) there has been compliance by the owner and operator with all other standards adopted by the City of Inglewood or by the department.
(c) The City of Inglewood shall be responsible for ensuring that an advertising display is consistent with this section and provides a public benefit. This provision shall not be construed to preclude any enforcement authority of the department under this chapter.
(d) The City of Inglewood shall annually certify to the department, by December 31 of each year, that at least 10 percent of the advertising copy, up to a maximum of 100 square feet, is used to display the address or location or locations of the business or activity or to identify the route to the business or activity from the nearest freeway offramp. The department may independently review compliance with this certification. An advertising display subject to this section shall be removed if it is in violation of this section more than three times within a 10-year period and the violation has not been corrected within 30 days of the date of mailing of a violation notice to the owner or operator by the department.
(e) The City of Inglewood shall have primary responsibility for ensuring that the advertising display authorized pursuant to this section remains in conformance with all of the provisions of this section. If the City of Inglewood fails to do so within 30 days of the date of mailing of a notice to the city by the department, the city shall hold the department harmless and indemnify the department for all costs incurred by the department to ensure compliance with this section or to defend actions challenging the authorization of displays pursuant to this section.

Due to unique circumstances concerning the location of the advertising displays, or proposed advertising displays, set forth in this act and the need for advertising in that location, it is necessary that an exemption from some of the provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act be provided for those displays, and the Legislature finds and declares that a general statute cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Outdoor Advertising Act, provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act regulates the placement of off-premises advertising displays along highways that generally advertise business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold at a location other than the property upon which the display is located. A violation of the act is a crime.
The act also provides that an advertising display advertising businesses and activities developed within the boundary limits of, and as a part of, an individual redevelopment agency project, as those project boundaries existed on December 29, 2011, may remain and be considered an on-premises display, until January 1, 2023, if the advertising display meets specified criteria. The act further authorizes, on and after January 1, 2022, the applicable city, county, or city and county to request from the department an extension for good cause, as specified, beyond January 1, 2023, not to exceed the expiration of the redevelopment project area.
This bill would authorize under similar provisions the advertising of businesses or activities operating outside a redevelopment project area but within the boundaries of the City of Inglewood. The bill would impose certain duties on the City of Inglewood regarding advertising displays. By increasing the level of service provided by the city, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would also make findings and declarations as to the need for a special statute relating to the City of Inglewood.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 5273.1 to the Business and Professions Code, relating to outdoor advertising."

(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), this chapter shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, which is enacted before January 1, 2028, deletes or extends that date.
(b) Except as specified in subdivisions (c) and (d), all loans outstanding as of January 1, 2028, shall continue to be repaid on a semiannual basis, as specified in Section 25415, until paid in full. All unexpended funds in the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account on January 1, 2028, and after that date, shall revert to the General Fund.
(c) To the extent required under applicable bond obligations, unexpended funds from the proceeds of bonds sold pursuant to Section 25417.5 that remain in the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account on January 1, 2028, shall remain in the account. These funds shall be expended pursuant to the applicable requirements for bond proceeds. Once all applicable bond obligations have been satisfied, unexpended funds shall revert to the General Fund.
(d) Unexpended funds from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) remaining in the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account on January 1, 2028, shall revert to the Federal Trust Fund.","Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to administer the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account, a continuously appropriated account in the General Fund, to provide grants and loans, until January 1, 2018, to schools, hospitals, public care institutions, and local governments to maximize energy use savings. For this purpose, existing law authorizes the commission, among other things, to borrow moneys from specified entities, including the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, as specified, and pledge specified loans or the principal and interest payments on those loans to provide collateral in connection with those borrowed moneys. Existing law also authorizes the commission to enter into pledge agreements setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the commission is making those pledges.
This bill would extend the operation of all of those provisions to January 1, 2028, and would thereby make an appropriation by extending the time during which the funds deposited in a continuously appropriated account are made available for expenditure. The bill would authorize the commission to pledge collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The bill would also expressly authorize the commission to enter into pledge agreements pursuant to which the commission is pledging collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.","An act to amend Sections 25417.5 and 25421 of the Public Resources Code, relating to energy, and making an appropriation therefor."
334,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) In order to create a statewide disaster preparedness, response, and recovery system and to facilitate the reach of local services to vulnerable populations, this act is established to expand 2-1-1 services to all areas of California that do not currently have access to this vital service.
(2) 2-1-1 service is a free, accessible, three-digit telephone number that gives everyone in covered areas access to needed community services. First established in 2005, 2-1-1 service now covers 38 California counties. It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, allowing residents to access information about health and human services, emergency care, crisis intervention, and disaster preparedness, response, and recovery when they need it most.
(3) 2-1-1 service is a natural hub for disaster-related information and plays a critical role during emergencies and disasters, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and epidemics, reducing nonemergency call volume on 9-1-1 lines, which frees up emergency responders to deal with true life-or-death situations, thus leveraging local public safety resources.
(4) 2-1-1 service also increases the reach of government, nonprofit, and community programs by offering callers information on and access to a variety of health and human services, rent and utility assistance, physical and mental health resources, employment opportunities, support for older Americans and persons with disabilities, and support for families with special needs.
(5) 2-1-1 service call centers are staffed with highly trained specialists who have expertise in navigating the web of health and human services in a particular community and who have up-to-date information and guidance for callers in times of disaster.
(6) 2-1-1 service call center specialists are able to answer calls in over 150 different languages; they are able to provide critical health information to otherwise hard-to-reach ethnic populations.
(7) Twenty rural counties in California currently do not have access to 2-1-1 services, creating holes in referral services and disaster response capability.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to facilitate the expansion of 2-1-1 services into those counties in California where they are lacking and to support a comprehensive statewide database that will connect all callers to the information and referrals they need.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature to facilitate access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information, and referral services, uniformly in the state, especially in hard-to-serve rural areas, through a universally available 2-1-1 telephone service.

Section 280 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
280.
(a) The commission shall develop, implement, and administer a program to advance universal service by providing discounted rates to qualifying schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, community colleges, libraries, hospitals, health clinics, and community organizations, consistent with Chapter 278 of the Statutes of 1994.
(b) There is hereby created the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee, which is an advisory board to advise the commission regarding the development, implementation, and administration of a program to advance universal service by providing discounted rates to qualifying schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, community colleges, libraries, hospitals, health clinics, and community organizations, consistent with Chapter 278 of the Statutes of 1994, and to carry out the program pursuant to the commission’s direction, control, and approval.
(c) All revenues collected by telephone corporations in rates authorized by the commission to fund the program specified in subdivision (a) shall be submitted to the commission pursuant to a schedule established by the commission. The commission shall transfer the moneys received to the Controller for deposit in the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund. All interest earned by moneys in the fund shall be deposited in the fund.
(d) Except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (g), moneys appropriated from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund to the commission shall be utilized exclusively by the commission for the program specified in subdivision (a), including all costs of the board and the commission associated with the administration and oversight of the program and the fund.
(e) Moneys loaned from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund in the Budget Act of 2003 are subject to Section 16320 of the Government Code. If the commission determines a need for moneys in the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund, the commission shall notify the Director of Finance of the need, as specified in Section 16320 of the Government Code. The commission may not increase the rates authorized by the commission to fund the program specified in subdivision (b) while moneys loaned from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund in the Budget Act of 2003 are outstanding unless both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The Director of Finance, after making a determination pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 16320 of the Government Code, does not order repayment of all or a portion of any loan from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund within 30 days of notification by the commission of the need for the moneys.
(2) The commission notifies the Director of Finance and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in writing that it intends to increase the rates authorized by the commission to fund the program specified in subdivision (a). The notification required pursuant to this paragraph shall be made 30 days in advance of the intended rate increase.
(f) Subdivision (e) shall become inoperative upon full repayment or discharge of all moneys loaned from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund in the Budget Act of 2003.
(g) (1) Consistent with Decision 11-09-016 (September 8, 2011) Decision Granting Authority to Provide Emergency Access to 211 Services in Counties and Localities Without Existing 211 Centers and to Appoint a 211 Lead Entity, if it determines that doing so is an appropriate use of funds collected from ratepayers, the commission may expend up to one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund for one-time costs to help close 2-1-1 service gaps in counties lacking access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information and referral services, where technically feasible, through available 2-1-1 service. As the lead agency appointed by the commission in Decision 11-09-016, 2-1-1 California may apply to the commission for use of the funds in the counties that lack 2-1-1 service. If the commission determines that doing so is an appropriate use of funds collected from ratepayers, these costs may include local implementation of a coordinated database that is owned by a city or county to provide referrals to help with nonemergency aspects of disaster planning, recovery, and response.
(2) This subdivision shall become inoperative on January 1, 2023.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), pursuant to its existing authority over the North American Numbering Plan, has established several abbreviated dialing codes, including designating the number 9-1-1 for persons to dial to obtain emergency services, designating the number 3-1-1 for persons to dial for nonemergency police assistance, and designating the number 2-1-1 for persons to dial to obtain information about, and referral to, community social services. Pursuant to authority delegated by the FCC to state regulatory bodies and its existing statutory authority, the Public Utilities Commission has established procedures for implementing 2-1-1 dialing in California.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to facilitate the expansion of 2-1-1 services into those counties in California where they are lacking and to support a comprehensive statewide database that will connect all callers to information and referrals they need. The bill would additionally state the intent of the Legislature to facilitate access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information, and referral services, uniformly in the state, especially in hard-to-serve rural areas, through a universally available telephone service.
Existing law requires the commission to develop, implement, and administer a program to advance universal service by providing discounted rates to qualifying schools, community colleges, libraries, hospitals, health clinics, and community organizations. Existing law requires that all revenues collected by telephone corporations in rates authorized by the commission to fund this program be deposited in the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund. Existing law provides that moneys in the fund are held in trust and may be expended only upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act or upon supplemental appropriation and requires that all moneys appropriated to the commission from the fund be used exclusively for the program.
If the commission determines that doing so is an appropriate use of funds collected from ratepayers, the bill would, until January 1, 2023, authorize the commission to expend up to $1,500,000 from the fund to help close 2-1-1 service gaps in counties lacking access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information and referral services, where technically feasible, through available 2-1-1 service.","An act to amend Section 280 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to telecommunications."

This bill would expand the scope of the provisional licensing program by extending the applicable age range for the program from 16 to under 18 years of age to 16 to under 21 years of age. By expanding the scope of the provisional licensing program, the violation of which constitutes an infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize a licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age to keep in his or her possession a copy of his or her class schedule or work schedule as documentation to satisfy the exceptions for

The bill would make other
technical and
conforming changes.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 12814.6 of the Vehicle Code, relating to driver’s licenses."

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1) On October 12, 2010, the federal Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-273; hereafter referred to as the Disposal Act) was enacted. Before the Disposal Act, individuals who wanted to dispose of unused, unwanted, or expired pharmaceutical controlled substances had limited disposal options. The federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 801 et seq.; hereafter referred to as the CSA) only permitted individuals to destroy those substances themselves (e.g., by flushing or discarding), surrender them to law enforcement, or seek assistance from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). These restrictions resulted in the accumulation of pharmaceutical controlled substances in household medicine cabinets that were available for abuse, misuse, diversion, and accidental ingestion. The Disposal Act amended the CSA to authorize specified individuals, referred to as “ultimate users,” to deliver their pharmaceutical controlled substances to another person for the purpose of disposal in accordance with regulations promulgated by the United States Attorney General.
(2) On September 9, 2014, the DEA issued its final rule governing the secure disposal of controlled substances by registrants and ultimate users. Those regulations implement the Disposal Act by expanding the options available to collect controlled substances from ultimate users for the purpose of disposal, including take-back events, mail-back programs, and collection receptacle locations. Those regulations, among other things, allow authorized manufacturers, distributors, reverse distributors, narcotic treatment programs, hospitals/clinics with an onsite pharmacy, and retail pharmacies to voluntarily administer mail-back programs and maintain collection receptacles.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature, with the enactment of this act, to do both of the following:
(1) Encourage the good faith participation of federally authorized entities to maintain secure drug take-back bins on their premises for the convenience and public health and safety of prescription drug consumers and the proper disposal in the waste stream of the pharmaceutical waste contained in the bins.
(2) Limit the civil and criminal liability of participating entities that meet certain minimum standards and take reasonable care to ensure the health and safety of consumers and employees when maintaining secure drug take-back bins on their premises.
(c) The terms and conditions provided by subdivision (b) of Section 1714.24 of the Civil Code, as added by this act, shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements imposed by the DEA’s final rule governing the secure disposal of controlled substances (79 Fed. Reg. 53519-70 (September 9, 2014)) and any regulations promulgated by the state.
SEC. 2.
Section 1714.24 is added to the Civil Code, to read:
1714.24.
(a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Collector” includes only those entities authorized by and registered with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to receive a controlled substance for the purpose of destruction, if the entity is in good standing with any applicable licensing authority.
(2) “Compensation” means reimbursement or funds received from a customer to compensate for the cost incurred in obtaining, installing, or maintaining a secure drug take-back bin. “Compensation” does not include reimbursement or funds received from any other person or entity, other than a customer, to compensate for the costs incurred in obtaining, installing, or maintaining a secure drug take-back bin.
(3) “Home-generated pharmaceutical waste” means a pharmaceutical that is no longer wanted or needed by the consumer and includes any delivery system, such as pills, liquids, and inhalers.
(4) “Maintains” includes owning, leasing, operating, or otherwise hosting a secure drug take-back bin on the collector’s premises.
(5) “Pharmaceutical” means a prescription or over-the-counter human or veterinary drug, including, but not limited to, a drug as defined in Section 109925 of the Health and Safety Code and Section 321(g)(1) of Title 21 of the United States Code. “Pharmaceutical” includes controlled substances included in Schedule II, III, IV, or V of the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act (Division 10 (commencing with Section 11000) of the Health and Safety Code), but does not include a controlled substance included in Schedule I.
(6) “Secure drug take-back bin” means a collection receptacle as described in Section 1317.75 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(b) Any collector that maintains a secure drug take-back bin shall not be liable in a civil action, or be subject to criminal prosecution, for any injury or harm that results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin on its premises provided that the collector, not for compensation, acts in good faith to take all of the following steps to ensure the health and safety of consumers and employees and the proper disposal in the waste stream of the home-generated pharmaceutical waste contained in a secure drug take-back bin, unless the injury or harm results from the collector’s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct:
(1) Complies with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations relating to the collection of home-generated pharmaceutical waste for disposal in secure drug take-back bins, including, but not limited to, the federal Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-273).
(2) Notifies local law enforcement and any local environmental health department as to the existence and location of any secure drug take-back bin on the collector’s premises and the status of the collector’s registration as a collector with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
(3) Ensures that the secure drug take-back bin is placed in a location that is regularly monitored by employees of the registered collector.
(4) Ensures that conspicuous signage is posted on the secure drug take-back bin that clearly notifies customers as to what controlled and noncontrolled substances are and are not acceptable for deposit into the bin, as well as the hours during which collection is allowed.
(5) Ensures that public access to the secure drug take-back bin is limited to hours in which employees of the registered collector are present and able to monitor the operation of the secure drug take-back bin.
(6) Regularly inspects the area surrounding the secure drug take-back bin for potential tampering or diversion. Record logs of those inspections shall be maintained and retained for two years, reflecting the date and time of the inspection, and the initials of the employee inspecting the area. The logs shall be maintained in writing or electronically and may be combined with logs required by state or federal regulations. The logs may be used to demonstrate regular inspection of the area. Other records or reports mandated by federal or state regulations shall also be retained for a minimum of two years unless regulations mandate a longer period.
(7) Notifies local law enforcement authorities of any suspected or known tampering, theft, or significant loss of controlled substances, within one business day of discovery. If the collector maintains daily business hours, this notification shall be made within one calendar day.
(8) Notify local law enforcement as to any decision to discontinue its voluntary collection of controlled substances and provide documentation of its written notification to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration’s Registration Unit as otherwise required under federal laws and regulations.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require entities that may qualify as a collector to acquire, maintain, or make available to the public a secure drug take-back bin on its premises.","Under existing law, the Medical Waste Management Act, the State Department of Public Health regulates the management and handling of medical waste, including pharmaceutical waste, as defined. The act generally prohibits a person from transporting, storing, treating, disposing, or causing the treatment of medical waste in a manner not authorized by the act. A violation of that provision is a crime.
Under existing law, everyone is generally responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter, has willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself.
This bill would provide that a collector, as defined, is not liable for civil damages, or subject to criminal prosecution, for any injury or harm that results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin on its premises provided that the collector, not for compensation, acts in good faith to take specified steps, including that the collector regularly inspects the area surrounding the secure drug take-back bin for potential tampering or diversion, to ensure the health and safety of consumers and employees and the proper disposal in the waste stream of home-generated pharmaceutical waste, as defined, contained in the bins.","An act to add Section 1714.24 to the Civil Code, relating to pharmaceutical waste."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The issue of corruption in small charter cities across the state is an increasing and alarming trend, with no signs of slowing or stopping.
(b) Small charter cities such as the City of Vernon, the City of Bell, and the City of Industry have long histories of abuses of power within city limits, going back decades. Those abuses include inflated salaries for city officials, failing to establish minimum qualifications for key positions, fiscally risky bond issuances, misappropriation of public funds, city officials issuing loans to themselves, failure to plan basic municipal responsibilities such as energy purchases according to best practices, incorrectly classifying employees to obtain higher, unearned retirement benefits, forcing employees to work at will for the city council, buying residential properties and renting them at below-market rents to city workers, inadequate and self-serving contracting policies, routine violations of conflict-of-interest policies, and little or no restrictions on city-issued credit cards.
(c) The voter base in small charter cities is tightly managed by city officials. The housing units within these cities are controlled by city leaders and rented out to handpicked tenants at below-market cost, thus keeping the voter base indebted to those in power. Efforts to broaden the homeowning population have met with resistance from city leaders, with officials in one city cutting power to new residents in an effort to force them from their homes.
(d) Criminal charges have also been filed in some instances, furthering the notion that these cities should not govern themselves. Voter fraud, conspiracy, and misappropriation of public funds are some of the charges that have been investigated, and are still being investigated, in some cases.
(e) This corruption has taken a toll on voter trust, citizen confidence, and taxpayer funds.
(f) In January 2016, an audit was released by the Controller highlighting the lack of administrative and internal accounting controls. Out of the 79 control elements evaluated by the Controller, 85 percent was found to be inadequate. Of the ethical components evaluated, none were found to be adequate.
(g) Historically, cities with small population size were not authorized to adopt a charter for local governance. However, in 1970, the Constitution was amended to authorize any city to adopt a charter. Since then, California’s citizens have seen one after another small charter city become mired in corruption and the leaders of these cities enrich themselves at the expense of the California taxpayer. Ensuring that our citizens, no matter where they live, have an open, honest, and transparent government is a matter of statewide concern, and not a municipal affair, and as a result the Legislature has the authority and the responsibility to impose heightened governing requirements. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that the provisions of this act are not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution, but are instead a matter of statewide concern.
SEC. 2.
Section 34096 is added to the Government Code, to read:
34096.
Notwithstanding any other law, all of the following shall apply to a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992:
(a) No more than 5 percent of the city’s total city-owned housing may be occupied by any of the following persons:
(1) Employees or officers of the city, including the family of employees or officers of the city.
(2) Persons that contract with the city, including employees of persons or companies that contract with the city, and including the family of persons who contract with the city and the family of employees of persons or companies that contract with the city.
(b) The city shall make an annual disclosure of all property owned by the city, wherever that property is situated.
(c) The city shall conduct an annual audit that utilizes internal control components and elements based on the guidelines established by the Government Accountability Office’s Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool. The city shall substantially comply with those guidelines.
(d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.

Section 36516.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:

(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the compensation for service on the city council of a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, shall not exceed $1,000 per month.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC. 4.
Section 1100.8 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:
1100.8.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 1100.7, this code shall apply to contracts entered into by a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, including, but not limited to, contracts for the provision of waste collection and management services.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC.
5.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the concerns related to the governance of a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992.

Section 34450 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
34450.
Any city or city and county may enact, amend, or repeal a charter for its own government pursuant to this article or Article 3 (commencing with Section 9255) of Chapter 3 of Division 9 of the Elections Code.","Existing law
The California Constitution
authorizes any city or city and county to enact, amend, or repeal a charter for its own government, as specified.
A charter adopted pursuant to these provisions supersedes general laws of the state in regard to a municipal affair, and a city charter may specify various matters including, but not limited to, compensation of city
employees.
This bill would, until January 1, 2028, require a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, to conduct audits pursuant to a specified procedure and provide annual disclosures of property owned by the city, as specified. By increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would, until January 1, 2028, additionally prohibit a city meeting this description from permitting more than 5% of any cityowned housing to be occupied by a city employee or officer, or person who contracts with the city, or their family. The bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the compensation for service on the city council of a city meeting this description may not exceed $1,000 per month.
Existing law states that the Public Contract Code is the basis of all contracts between most public entities and their contractors and subcontractors. Existing law further states that, with regard to charter cities, the code applies unless there is an express exemption or a charter city ordinance or regulation that is in direct conflict with the code.
This bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the Public Contract Code applies to a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, as specified.
This bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern, and not a municipal affair.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The letter shall be signed by the person who claims to have been aggrieved, or his or her representative.
(1) The letter shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the person or entity alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice.
(2) The letter may, alternatively, be sent to an authorized representative of the person or entity that is alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice.

(d) If the person alleged to have engaged in an unlawful act or practice fails to respond to the letter within 30 days after the letter is received, or delivering of the letter is attempted, the person who claims to have been aggrieved may pursue other efforts to be made whole, including filing a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction or alternative dispute resolution, including mandatory arbitration if applicable.
(e) The statute of limitations on a claim arising from the alleged unlawful act or practice subject to this section shall be tolled for a period of 30 days following the date of mailing as set forth in subdivision (a), plus any additional period of time during which the parties engage in negotiations under this section.

The bill would require the person who claims to have been aggrieved to engage with that person or entity in good faith efforts to be made whole, if, during the 30-day period following the date on which the letter was received there is a response from the person or entity that is alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice.
The bill would toll the statute of limitations on a claim arising from the alleged unlawful act or practice for the 30-day period, including the following period of negotiations, if any.

345,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) There are over 7,500 public water systems in California. The vast majority of these systems provide a reliable supply of safe drinking water. However, there are hundreds of smaller public water systems that consistently fail to provide a reliable supply of safe drinking water to their customers. Many failing public water systems were created without the necessary technical, managerial, or financial capacity to be sustainable in the long term in view of water supply uncertainties. These uncertainties can be created by effects on water quality and quantity, global climate change, migration of groundwater contamination, the establishment of new drinking water standards, and other factors that are known to significantly erode a system’s capacity.
(b) Failing public water systems disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities who are least able to afford to address the conditions that led to the failure.
(c) The proliferation of new, unsustainable public water systems also may undermine the state’s human right to water policy.
(d) Therefore, it is the policy of the state to discourage the establishment of new, unsustainable public water systems when there is a feasible alternative.
SEC. 2.
Section 116527 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
116527.
(a) As used in this section, “water-related improvement” includes, but is not limited to, a water pipe, a water pump, or drinking water infrastructure.
(b) (1) Before a person submits an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system, the person shall first submit a preliminary technical report to the state board at least six months before initiating construction of any water-related improvement.
(2) In order to assist in expediting the permitting process, a person that is considering submitting an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system is encouraged, but is not required, to submit the preliminary technical report no later than seven days after submission of an application to the city or county for a building permit for any water-related improvement.
(3) For a proposed new public water system that would be regulated by a local primacy agency, the applicant shall also submit a copy of the preliminary technical report to the state board.
(c) The preliminary technical report shall include all of the following:
(1) The name of each public water system for which any service area boundary is within three miles, as measured through existing public rights-of-way, of any boundary of the applicant’s proposed public water system’s service area.
(2) A discussion of the feasibility of each of the adjacent public water systems identified pursuant to paragraph (1) annexing, connecting, or otherwise supplying domestic water to the applicant’s proposed new public water system’s service area. The applicant shall consult with each adjacent public water system in preparing the report and shall include in the report any information provided by each adjacent public water system regarding the feasibility of annexing, connecting, or otherwise supplying domestic water to that service area.
(3) A discussion of all actions taken by the applicant to secure a supply of domestic water from an existing public water system for the proposed new public water system’s service area.
(4) All sources of domestic water supply for the proposed new public water system.
(5) The estimated cost to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed new public water system, including long-term operation and maintenance costs and a potential rate structure.
(6) A comparison of the costs associated with the construction, operation and maintenance, and long-term sustainability of the proposed new public water system to the costs associated with providing water to the proposed new public water system’s service area through annexation by, consolidation with, or connection to an existing public water system.
(7) A discussion of all actions taken by the applicant to pursue a contract for managerial or operational oversight from an existing public water system.
(8) An analysis of whether a proposed new public water system’s total projected water supplies available during normal, single dry, or multiple dry water years during a 20-year projection will meet the projected water demand for the service area.
(9) Any information provided by the local agency formation commission. The applicant shall consult with the local agency formation commission if any adjacent public water system identified pursuant to paragraph (1) is a local agency as defined by Section 56054 of the Government Code.
(d) (1) If documents prepared to comply with Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code or any other application for public agency approval concerning providing drinking water to the proposed new public water system’s service area include the information required by subdivision (c), including documentation of the consultation with each adjacent public water system and the local agency formation commission, the applicant may submit those documents to the state board in lieu of the preliminary technical report and the documents shall be considered the functional equivalent of the preliminary technical report.
(2) If documents prepared to comply with Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code or any other application for public agency approval concerning providing drinking water to the proposed new public water system’s service area include some, but not all, of the information required by subdivision (c), including documentation of the consultation with an adjacent public water system and the local agency formation commission, the applicant shall submit those documents and the preliminary technical report to the state board and together those documents and the preliminary technical report shall be considered the functional equivalent of the preliminary technical report requirements of this section. A preliminary technical report submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall only be required to include information that is not otherwise addressed by the other submitted documents.
(e) Upon review of a preliminary technical report submitted pursuant to this section, the state board may do all of the following actions:
(1) If an existing public water system has not already sought annexation of the service area of a proposed new public water system from the local agency formation commission or the applicant has not already sought an extension of services agreement from an existing public water system, direct the applicant to undertake additional discussion and negotiation with the local agency formation commission and any existing public water system meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) that the state board determines has the technical, managerial, and financial capacity to provide an adequate and reliable supply of domestic water to the service area of the proposed new public water system. The state board shall not direct the applicant to undertake additional discussion and negotiation if documentation submitted to the state board demonstrates that additional discussion and negotiation is unlikely to be successful, including, but not limited to, documentation that the local agency formation commission has previously denied the application for an extension of service or annexation, or that the existing public water system has declined to apply to the local agency formation commission for approval of an extension of services to, or annexation of, the service area of the proposed new public water system.
(2) Direct the applicant to report on the results of discussion and negotiations conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) to the state board.
(3) Establish a time schedule for the applicant’s performance of directives issued pursuant to this subdivision.
(f) (1) An applicant shall comply with the state board’s directives as assigned in and consistent with subdivision (e) before submitting an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system under this chapter.
(2) An application for a permit for a proposed new public water system under this chapter shall not be deemed complete unless the applicant has complied with the requirements of this section.

(h) The requirements of this section do not apply to either of the following:
(1) An application for a permit for a new public water system that was deemed complete prior to January 1, 2017, pursuant to the statutory permit application requirements effective at the date of the permit submission.
(2) An extension of, or annexation to, an existing public water system.
(i) (1) The requirements of this section do not apply to a service area where an applicant certifies in writing to the state board that the applicant will not rely on the establishment of a new public water system for its water supply. The state board shall acknowledge receipt of the applicant’s certification in a timely manner.
(2) An applicant who certifies that the service area will not rely on the establishment of a new public water system and later seeks a permit for a new public water system shall comply with the provisions of this section and shall assume all risk of delay or rejection related to the permit application.
(j) (1) The provisions of this subdivision apply to a proposed new public water system that achieves either or both of the following:
(A) Consolidates two or more existing public water systems, existing state small water systems, or other existing water systems, which results in the creation of a new public water system.
(B) Provides water service in lieu of individual domestic wells.
(2) At least six months before the construction of any water-related improvements, an applicant for a new public water system that meets the criteria in paragraph (1) shall provide a written notice to the state board that does both of the following:
(A) Clearly describes the proposed new public water system and how it meets the criteria in paragraph (1).
(B) Requests an exemption from the requirements of this section.
(3) The state board shall promptly acknowledge receipt of a written notice described in paragraph (2). The state board shall have 30 days from the acknowledgment of receipt of the written notice to issue a written notice to the applicant that compliance with the requirements of this section is necessary and that an application for a permit of a new public water system under this chapter is not complete until the applicant has complied with the requirements of this section. A determination by the state board that compliance with the requirements of this section is necessary shall be final and is not subject to review by the state board. A determination by the state board pursuant to this subdivision is not considered a project subject to Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code.
(4) If the state board receives a written notice from a project applicant that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (2), the project described in the notice is deemed exempt from the requirements of this section on the 35th day following the date of the state board’s acknowledgment of receipt of the written notice, unless the state board has issued a notice to comply pursuant to paragraph (3).
SEC. 3.
Section 116540 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
116540.
(a) Following completion of the investigation and satisfaction of the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2), the state board shall issue or deny the permit. The state board may impose permit conditions, requirements for system improvements, technical, financial, or managerial requirements, and time schedules as it deems necessary to ensure a reliable and adequate supply of water at all times that is pure, wholesome, potable, and does not endanger the health of consumers.
(1) A public water system that was not in existence on January 1, 1998, shall not be granted a permit unless the public water system demonstrates to the state board that the water supplier possesses adequate financial, managerial, and technical capability to ensure the delivery of pure, wholesome, and potable drinking water. This section shall also apply to any change of ownership of a public water system.
(2) A permit under this chapter shall not be issued to an association organized under Title 3 (commencing with Section 18000) of the Corporations Code. This section shall not apply to unincorporated associations that, as of December 31, 1990, are holders of a permit issued under this chapter.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 116330, a local primacy agency shall not issue a permit under this article without the concurrence of the state board.
(c) In considering whether to approve a proposed new public water system, the state board shall consider the sustainability of the proposed new public water system and its water supply in the reasonably foreseeable future, in view of global climate change, potential migration of groundwater contamination and other potential treatment needs, and other factors that can significantly erode a system’s capacity.
(d) If the state board determines that it is feasible for the service area of the public water system addressed by an application under this article to be served by one or more permitted public water systems identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 116527, the state board may deny the permit of a proposed new public water system if it determines, based on its assessment of the preliminary technical report submitted pursuant to Section 116527, the permit application, and other relevant, substantial evidence submitted, that it is reasonably foreseeable that the proposed new public water system will be unable to provide affordable, safe drinking water in the reasonably foreseeable future.
(e) An applicant may appeal decisions and actions of the deputy director taken pursuant to this section to the state board.
SEC. 4.
Section 106.4 is added to the Water Code, to read:
106.4.
(a) For the purposes of this section:
(1) “Bottled water” has the same meaning as defined in Section 111070 of the Health and Safety Code.
(2) “Residential development” has the same meaning as defined in Section 65008 of the Government Code.
(3) “Retail water facility” has the same meaning as defined in Section 111070 of the Health and Safety Code.
(4) “Water-vending machine” has the same meaning as defined in Section 111070 of the Health and Safety Code.
(5) “Water hauler” has the same meaning as defined in Section 111070 of the Health and Safety Code.
(b) A city, including a charter city, or a county shall not issue a building permit for the construction of a new residential development where a source of water supply is water transported by a water hauler, bottled water, a water-vending machine, or a retail water facility.
(c) This section does not apply to a residence that will be rebuilt because of a natural disaster.
(d) The Legislature finds and declares that this section addresses a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act or because costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, imposes on the State Water Resources Control Board various responsibilities and duties relating to providing a dependable, safe supply of drinking water. The act prohibits a person from operating a public water system unless he or she first submits an application, including a technical report, to the state board and receives a permit, as specified. The act requires the state board, upon determination that the application is complete, to make a specified investigation, and allows the state board to impose permit conditions, requirements for system improvements, and time schedules as the state board deems necessary to ensure an affordable, reliable, and adequate supply of water at all times that is pure, wholesome, and potable. The act provides that a person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation in a report submitted, maintained, or used for purposes of compliance with the act may be punished as a misdemeanor.
This bill would require a person submitting an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system to first submit a preliminary technical report to the state board at least 6 months before initiating construction of any water-related improvement, as defined. Because a misstatement in the report could be a crime under the provision described above, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of a crime. The bill would allow the state board to direct the applicant to undertake additional discussion and negotiation with certain existing public water systems the state board determines have the technical, managerial, and financial capacity to provide an adequate and reliable supply of domestic water to the service area of the proposed new public water system, as specified, and would require an applicant to comply before submitting an application for a permit to operate a system and would prohibit the application from being deemed complete unless the applicant has complied. The bill would, if the state board determines that it is feasible for the service area of the public water system addressed by the application to be served by one or more currently permitted public water systems, authorize the state board to deny the permit of a proposed new public water system if it determines that it is reasonably foreseeable that the proposed new public water system will be unable to provide affordable, safe drinking water in the reasonably foreseeable future, as prescribed.
(2) Existing law allows the state board to delegate primary responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the act within a county to a local health officer if certain criteria are met. Existing law requires that the local primacy agency be empowered with all of the authority granted to the state board over the specified public water systems.
This bill would prohibit a local primacy agency from issuing a permit to operate a public water system without the concurrence of the state board. The bill would require, for a proposed new public water system that would be regulated by a local primacy agency, the applicant to also submit a copy of the preliminary technical report to the state board.
(3) Existing law declares the established policy of the state that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes. Existing law requires a city or county that determines a project, as defined, is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act to identify certain water systems that may supply water for the project and to request those public water systems to prepare and approve a specified water supply assessment. Under existing law, if no public water system is identified, the city or county is required to prepare and approve the water supply assessment. Existing law provides that if, as a result of its assessment, the public water system or city or county concludes that its water supplies are, or will be, insufficient, the public water system or city or county is required to provide its plans for acquiring additional water supplies, as prescribed.
This bill would prohibit a city, including a charter city, or a county from issuing a building permit for the construction of a new residential development where a source of the water supply is water transported by a water hauler, bottled water, a water-vending machine, or a retail water facility, as specified. By imposing new duties on a city or county in connection with the issuance of a building permit, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","An act to amend Section 116540 of, and to add Section 116527 to, the Health and Safety Code, and to add Section 106.4 to the Water Code, relating to drinking water."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SECTION 1.
Section 600 of the
Harbors and Navigation Code
is amended to read:
600.
As used in this chapter:
(a)“Watercraft” means any boat, ship, barge, craft or floating thing designed for navigation in the water.
(b)“Nonresident” means a person who is not a resident of this state at the time the accident or collision occurs or at the time a cause of action or claim for relief arises against him, and also means a person who, at the time the accident or collision occurs or at the time a cause of action or claim for relief arises against him is a resident of this state but subsequently becomes a nonresident of this state.","Existing law, as amended by Proposition 21 as approved by the voters at the March 7, 2000, statewide primary election and by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, classifies certain felonies as violent felonies for purposes of various provisions of the Penal Code. Existing law imposes an additional one-year term for a felony and a 3-year term for a violent felony for each prior separate prison term served for a violent felony. Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, also imposes additional years of imprisonment in state prison on a person who commits a violent felony and has been convicted of, or who has a prior conviction for, a violent felony. The Legislature may amend the above-specified initiative statutes by a statute passed in each house by a
2/3
vote.
This bill would additionally define human trafficking as a violent felony subject to the enhanced term of imprisonment.
Because this bill would increase penalties for a violation of human trafficking crimes, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law regulates the operation of watercraft, as defined, in the waterways of the state. Existing law defines a “watercraft” for purposes of those provisions to mean any boat, ship, barge, craft, or floating thing designed for navigation in the water.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in that definition of watercraft.","An act to amend Section 600 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, relating to vessels.
An act to amend Sections 667.1, 667.5, and 1170.125 of the Penal Code, relating to violent felonies."

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) There is an urgent and crucial need for mental health crisis stabilization services in California.
(2) In 2004, the California electorate approved Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act, to address serious mental illness among adults, children, and seniors, including the provision of prevention and early intervention services.
(3) Currently, there are counties using Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) moneys for crisis stabilization services, and other counties that are not. Some counties not using MHSA moneys for crisis stabilization services have expressed the need for clarification of state law that the colocation of voluntary and involuntary services at facilities providing crisis stabilization services does not preclude the use of MHSA moneys.
(b) The Legislature finds and declares that this act clarifies that counties may use funds provided under the Mental Health Services Act to provide
services to individuals who are voluntarily receiving services at facilities at which individuals who are receiving services involuntarily are also treated.

Section 5813.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5813.5.
Subject to the availability of funds from the Mental Health Services Fund, the state shall distribute funds for the provision of services under Sections 5801, 5802, and 5806 to county mental health programs. Services shall be available to adults and seniors with severe illnesses who meet the eligibility criteria in subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 5600.3. For purposes of this act, “seniors” means older adult persons identified in Part 3 (commencing with Section 5800) of this division.
(a) Funding shall be provided at sufficient levels to ensure that counties can provide each adult and senior served pursuant to this part with the medically necessary mental health services, medications, and supportive services set forth in the applicable treatment plan.
(b) The funding shall only cover the portions of those costs of services that cannot be paid for with other funds including other mental health funds, public and private insurance, and other local, state, and federal funds.
(c) Each county mental health program’s plan shall provide for services in accordance with the system of care for adults and seniors who meet the eligibility criteria in subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 5600.3.
(d) Planning for services shall be consistent with the philosophy, principles, and practices of the
Recovery Vision
recovery vision
for mental health consumers:
(1) To promote concepts key to the recovery for individuals who have mental illness: hope, personal empowerment, respect, social connections, self-responsibility, and self-determination.
(2) To promote consumer-operated services as a way to support recovery.
(3) To reflect the cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity of mental health consumers.
(4) To plan for each consumer’s individual needs.
(e) The plan for each county mental health program shall indicate, subject to the availability of funds as determined by Part 4.5 (commencing with Section 5890), and other funds available for mental health services, adults and seniors with a severe mental illness being served by this program are either receiving services from this program or have a mental illness that is not sufficiently severe to require the level of services required of this program.
(f) Each county plan and annual update pursuant to Section 5847 shall consider ways to provide services similar to those established pursuant to the Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program. Funds shall not be used to pay for persons incarcerated in state prison or parolees from state prisons.
(1) When included in county plans pursuant to Section 5847, funds may be used for the provision of mental health services under Sections 5347 and 5348 in counties that elect to participate in the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Demonstration Project Act of 2002 (Article 9 (commencing with Section 5345) of Chapter 2 of Part 1).
(2) When included in county plans pursuant to Section 5847, funds may be used for the provision of
voluntary
outpatient crisis stabilization services to
individuals who are voluntarily receiving those services, even when facilities colocate services to
individuals, even when
individuals who are receiving
services involuntarily
involuntary services
are treated at the same facility.
This paragraph is not intended to require or authorize the displacement of employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement governed by the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code) who perform services described in this paragraph.
(g) The department shall contract for services with county mental health programs pursuant to Section 5897. After the effective date of this section, the term grants referred to in Sections 5814 and 5814.5 shall refer to such contracts.","Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs. Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, funds a system of county mental health plans for the provision of mental health services, as specified.
The act establishes the Mental Health Services Fund,
which is
continuously appropriated
to
to,
and administered
by
by,
the State Department of Health Care Services, to fund specified county mental health programs, including programs funded under the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health System of Care Act. Existing law prohibits these funds from being used to pay for persons incarcerated in state prison or parolees from state prisons.
This bill would clarify that the counties may use Mental Health Services Fund moneys to provide
voluntary
outpatient crisis stabilization services to
individuals who are voluntarily receiving those services,
individuals,
even when individuals who are receiving
involuntary
services
involuntarily
are treated at the same facility. Because the bill would clarify the procedures and terms of Proposition 63, it would require a majority vote of the Legislature.","An act to amend Section 5813.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health."

The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique distribution and market conditions of liquor licenses in the City and County of San Francisco, that apply only to the City and County of San Francisco.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
No reimbursement shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code for costs mandated by the state pursuant to this act. It is recognized, however, that a local agency or school district may pursue any remedies to obtain reimbursement available to it under Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) and any other provisions of law.","The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, administered by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, regulates the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages and the granting of licenses for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages within the state. The act also provides for a limitation on the amount of on-sale general licenses that may be issued by the department based on the population of the county in which the licensed premises are located, as provided. Existing law also provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending on the type of license issued.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2017, provide an exception to the license limitation for a county of the 6th class, as specified, for 5 new original neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general licenses for premises located within specified census tracts in that county, subject to specified requirements. This bill would impose an original fee and annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund, and would require an applicant for this license to submit a specified application, submitted under the penalty of perjury, to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. This bill would also require the applicant to submit a signed verification by the local government in which the licensed premises would be located stating that the applicant has completed certain preapplication requirements.
By requiring an applicant to submit an application under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason and that no reimbursement shall be made pursuant to those statutory provisions for costs mandated by the state pursuant to this act, but would recognize that local agencies and school districts may pursue any available remedies to seek reimbursement for these costs.

This bill would require a grand jury to request a subject person or entity to come before the grand jury as described above. The bill would authorize a grand jury to disclose the factual data used in making its findings during discussions conducted pursuant to these provisions.
This bill would authorize a grand jury to provide to a subject person or entity for comment an administrative draft of that portion of the grand jury’s report relating to that subject person or entity. The bill would require an administrative draft provided pursuant to this provision to include proposed grand jury findings, would authorize the draft to include the factual data utilized in making the grand jury’s findings, and would prohibit the draft from including the grand jury’s recommendations. Within a time period determined by the grand jury, but no sooner than 10 days after the grand jury submits an administrative draft of its report to a subject person or entity for comment, the bill would authorize the subject person or entity to file with the grand jury written comments on the findings and data included in the administrative draft pertaining to that subject person or entity. The bill would prohibit an officer, agency, department, or governing body of a public agency from disclosing any contents of the administrative draft of the report prior to the public release of the final report.
This bill would delete the authority of a grand jury to request a subject person or entity to come before it for purposes of reading and discussing the findings of a grand jury report.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California has been a global leader in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases through the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of Health and Safety Code) and the Governor’s Executive Orders S-3-05 and B-30-15.
(b) The state has developed a comprehensive climate adaptation strategy document titled “Safeguarding California: Implementation Action Plans” and has established the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program to further coordinate local and regional efforts with the state climate adaptation strategies.
(c) The state’s existing investment in natural infrastructure, including urban forest canopy, which helps accomplish both carbon sequestration and climate resilience, is at risk due to existing drought conditions.
(d) The drought has heightened awareness and underscored the importance of sustainable water management.
(e) Improved water retention and infiltration can greatly reduce reliance on potentially energy-intensive long-distance water imports and thereby reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
(f) Through carbon sequestration, the protection and management of natural and working lands and organic waste diversion are both integral to accomplishing the state’s policy to reduce greenhouse gas levels.
(g) The state has recently developed a strategy to dramatically increase the diversion of organic waste from landfills, with the organic waste being used to create compost and mulch.
(h) Composting and use of organic waste in improved landscape and healthy soil management have great potential to be cost effective at reducing greenhouse gas levels through improved carbon soil sequestration and may also greatly improve water retention and infiltration of stormwater flows.
(i) Composting may also provide important environmental and agricultural cobenefits, including reduction of naturally occurring volatile organic compounds and ammonia, and may help the state address agriculture, dairy, and forestry waste in a proper and environmentally responsible manner.

2962.
As a condition of parole, a prisoner who meets the following criteria shall be provided necessary treatment by the State Department of State Hospitals as follows:
(a) (1) The prisoner has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission or that cannot be kept in remission without treatment.
(2) The term “severe mental disorder” means an illness or disease or condition that substantially impairs the person’s thought, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or which grossly impairs behavior; or that demonstrates evidence of an acute brain syndrome for which prompt remission, in the absence of treatment, is unlikely. The term “severe mental disorder,” as used in this section, does not include a personality or adjustment disorder, epilepsy, mental retardation or other developmental disabilities, or addiction to or abuse of intoxicating substances.
(3) The term “remission” means a finding that the overt signs and symptoms of the severe mental disorder are controlled either by psychotropic medication or psychosocial support. A person “cannot be kept in remission without treatment” if during the year prior to the question being before the Board of Parole Hearings or a trial court, he or she has been in remission and he or she has been physically violent, except in self-defense, or he or she has made a serious threat of substantial physical harm upon the person of another so as to cause the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family, or he or she has intentionally caused property damage, or he or she has not voluntarily followed the treatment plan. In determining if a person has voluntarily followed the treatment plan, the standard shall be whether the person has acted as a reasonable person would in following the treatment plan.
(b) The severe mental disorder was one of the causes of, or was an aggravating factor in, the commission of a crime for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison.
(c) The prisoner has been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for 90 days or more within the year prior to the prisoner’s parole or release.
(d) (1) Prior to release on parole, the person in charge of treating the prisoner and a practicing psychiatrist or psychologist from the State Department of State Hospitals have evaluated the prisoner at a facility of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and a chief psychiatrist of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has certified to the Board of Parole Hearings that the prisoner has a severe mental disorder, that the disorder is not in remission, or cannot be kept in remission without treatment, that the severe mental disorder was one of the causes or was an aggravating factor in the prisoner’s criminal behavior, that the prisoner has been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for 90 days or more within the year prior to his or her parole release day, and that by reason of his or her severe mental disorder the prisoner represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others. For prisoners being treated by the State Department of State Hospitals pursuant to Section 2684, the certification shall be by a chief psychiatrist of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and the evaluation shall be done at a state hospital by the person at the state hospital in charge of treating the prisoner and a practicing psychiatrist or psychologist from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
(2) If the professionals doing the evaluation pursuant to paragraph (1) do not concur that (A) the prisoner has a severe mental disorder, (B) that the disorder is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment, or (C) that the severe mental disorder was a cause of, or aggravated, the prisoner’s criminal behavior, and a chief psychiatrist has certified the prisoner to the Board of Parole Hearings pursuant to this paragraph, then the Board of Parole Hearings shall order a further examination by two independent professionals, as provided for in Section 2978.
(3) If at least one of the independent professionals who evaluate the prisoner pursuant to paragraph (2) concurs with the chief psychiatrist’s certification of the issues described in paragraph (2), this subdivision shall be applicable to the prisoner. The professionals appointed pursuant to Section 2978 shall inform the prisoner that the purpose of their examination is not treatment but to determine if the prisoner meets certain criteria to be involuntarily treated as a mentally disordered offender. It is not required that the prisoner appreciate or understand that information.
(e) The crime referred to in subdivision (b) meets both of the following criteria:
(1) The defendant received a determinate sentence pursuant to Section 1170 for the crime.
(2) The crime is one of the following:

(O) Attempted murder.
(P) A crime not enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (O), inclusive, in which the prisoner used force or violence, or caused serious bodily injury as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (f) of Section 243.
(Q) A crime in which the perpetrator expressly or impliedly threatened another with the use of force or violence likely to produce substantial physical harm in such a manner that a reasonable person would believe and expect that the force or violence would be used.

(g) As used in this chapter, “substantial danger of physical harm” does not require proof of a recent overt act.","Existing law requires, as a condition of parole, a prisoner who has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission and who meets specified criteria to be treated by the State Department of State Hospitals and provided the necessary treatment. In order for that commitment to occur, existing law requires, among other criteria, that the severe mental disorder be one of the causes of, or an aggravating factor in, the commission of the crime, as defined, for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison. Existing law also requires the prisoner to have been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for 90 days or more within the year prior to the prisoner’s parole or release. Existing law establishes procedures for the evaluation of a prisoner under these provisions by specified health practitioners of the State Department of State Hospitals and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
This bill would authorize the use of certain documentary evidence for purposes of satisfying the criteria used to evaluate whether a prisoner released on parole is required to be treated by the State Department of State Hospitals.","An act to amend Section 2962 of the Penal Code, relating to mentally ill prisoners."

10095.
(a) Within 30 days following the effective date of this chapter, the association shall submit to the commissioner, for his or her review, a proposed plan of operation, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, creating an association consisting of all insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing in this state, on a direct basis, basic property insurance or any component of basic property insurance in homeowners or other dwelling multiperil policies. An insurer described in this subdivision shall be a member of the association and shall remain a member as a condition of its authority to transact those kinds of insurance in this state.
(b) The proposed plan shall authorize the association to assume and cede reinsurance on risks written by insurers in conformity with the program.

Premiums written on a policy of basic residential earthquake insurance issued by the California Earthquake Authority pursuant to Section 10089.6 shall be attributed to the insurer that writes the underlying policy of residential property insurance.
(d) The plan shall provide for administration by a governing committee under rules to be adopted by the governing committee with the approval of the commissioner.

(f) The plan shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and shall go into effect upon the tentative approval of the commissioner. The commissioner may, at any time, withdraw his or her tentative approval or he or she may, at any time after he or she has given his or her final approval, revoke that approval if he or she feels it is necessary to carry out the purposes of the chapter. The withdrawal or revocation of that approval shall not affect the validity of any policies executed prior to the date of the withdrawal.

(i) This section shall become operative March 1, 2017.
SEC. 3.
Section 10095.5 of the Insurance Code is amended to read:
10095.5.
(a) The association shall establish and maintain an Internet Web site and a statewide toll-free telephone number through which a person may receive information and assistance in applying for insurance through the plan. The association shall cause the toll-free telephone number to be published in all general distribution telephone directories in the state and shall include the toll-free telephone number and Internet Web site address on all communications with an applicant or insured.
(b) An insurance agent or broker transacting basic property insurance shall assist a person seeking his or her help in obtaining basic property insurance coverage by any one of the following methods:
(1) Making an application for insurance through the plan by submitting an application at the person’s request.
(2) Providing the person with the California FAIR Plan’s Internet Web site address and the toll-free telephone number.
(3) Making an application for insurance, at the person’s request, and placing that person with or through an insurer that offers, or a surplus line broker that procures, basic property insurance coverage.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to have the consumer protections proposed in this act become operative as soon as possible for homeowners who are having difficulty obtaining insurance coverage for their property because they are located in high-risk brush and wildfire areas, and to provide insurers adequate time to amend and prepare their required notices to customers about the availability of coverage through the California FAIR (fair access to insurance requirements) Plan, it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.","Under existing law, the California FAIR (fair access to insurance requirements) Plan Association is a joint reinsurance association of state insurers that is established to, among other things, assist persons in securing basic property insurance for qualified property for which insurance cannot be obtained through the normal insurance market. Existing law requires the association to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number through which a person may receive assistance in applying for basic property insurance. Existing law requires an insurer member of the plan to provide to an applicant who is denied coverage the toll-free telephone number for the plan for information and assistance in obtaining basic property insurance. Existing law requires an agent or broker transacting basic property insurance to either assist a person in making an application for insurance through the plan or to provide the person with that toll-free telephone number.
This bill would additionally require the association to establish and maintain an Internet Web site at which a person may receive information and assistance in applying for insurance through the plan and would require the association to include the toll-free telephone number and the Internet Web site address on all communications with an applicant or an insured. The bill, beginning March 1, 2017, would require an insurer member to provide an applicant denied coverage or a policyholder whose policy is canceled or not renewed both that Internet Web site address and toll-free telephone number. The bill would delete the provision permitting an agent or broker to provide the toll-free telephone number of the plan as an alternative to assisting a person in making an application for insurance through the plan, and would instead require an agent or broker to assist a person seeking his or her help in obtaining basic property insurance coverage by making an application for insurance through the plan by submitting an application at the person’s request, by providing the person with the California FAIR Plan’s Internet Web site address and the toll-free telephone number, or by making an application for insurance, at the person’s request, and placing that person with or through an insurer that offers, or a surplus line broker that procures, basic property insurance coverage.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 10095.5 of, and to amend, repeal, and add Section 10095 of, the Insurance Code, relating to insurance, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
355,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 170 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
170.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the board of supervisors, by ordinance, may provide that every assessee of any taxable property, or any person liable for the taxes on that property, whose property was damaged or destroyed without his or her fault, may apply for reassessment of that property as provided in this section. The ordinance may also specify that the assessor may initiate the reassessment where the assessor determines that within the preceding 12 months taxable property located in the county was damaged or destroyed.
To be eligible for reassessment the damage or destruction to the property shall have been caused by any of the following:
(1) A major misfortune or calamity, in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency or disaster, if that property was damaged or destroyed by the major misfortune or calamity that caused the Governor to proclaim the area or region to be in a state of emergency or disaster. As used in this paragraph, “damage” includes a diminution in the value of property as a result of restricted access or environmental contamination to the property where that restricted access or environmental contamination was caused by the major misfortune or calamity.
(2) A misfortune or calamity.
(3) A misfortune or calamity that, with respect to a possessory interest in land owned by the state or federal government, has caused the permit or other right to enter upon the land to be suspended or restricted. As used in this paragraph, “misfortune or calamity” includes a drought condition such as existed in this state in 1976 and 1977.
The application for reassessment may be filed within the time specified in the ordinance or within 12 months of the misfortune or calamity, whichever is later, by delivering to the assessor a written application requesting reassessment showing the condition and value, if any, of the property immediately after the damage or destruction, and the dollar amount of the damage. The application shall be executed under penalty of perjury, or if executed outside the State of California, verified by affidavit.
An ordinance may be made applicable to a major misfortune or calamity specified in paragraph (1) or to any misfortune or calamity specified in paragraph (2), or to both, as the board of supervisors determines. An ordinance shall not be made applicable to a misfortune or calamity specified in paragraph (3), unless an ordinance making paragraph (2) applicable is operative in the county. The ordinance may specify a period of time within which the ordinance shall be effective, and, if no period of time is specified, it shall remain in effect until repealed.
(b) Upon receiving a proper application, the assessor shall appraise the property and determine separately the full cash value of land, improvements, and personalty immediately before and after the damage or destruction. If the sum of the full cash values of the land, improvements, and personalty before the damage or destruction exceeds the sum of the values after the damage by ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, the assessor shall also separately determine the percentage reductions in value of land, improvements, and personalty due to the damage or destruction. The assessor shall reduce the values appearing on the assessment roll by the percentages of damage or destruction computed pursuant to this subdivision, and the taxes due on the property shall be adjusted as provided in subdivision (e). However, the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the actual loss.
(c) (1) As used in this subdivision, “board” means either the county board of supervisors acting as the county board of equalization, or an assessment appeals board established by the county board of supervisors in accordance with Section 1620, as applicable.
(2) The assessor shall notify the applicant in writing of the amount of the proposed reassessment. The notice shall state that the applicant may appeal the proposed reassessment to the board within six months of the date of mailing the notice. If an appeal is requested within the six-month period, the board shall hear and decide the matter as if the proposed reassessment had been entered on the roll as an assessment made outside the regular assessment period. The decision of the board regarding the damaged value of the property shall be final, provided that a decision of the board regarding any reassessment made pursuant to this section shall create no presumption as regards the value of the affected property subsequent to the date of the damage.
(3) Those reassessed values resulting from reductions in full cash value of amounts, as determined above, shall be forwarded to the auditor by the assessor or the clerk of the board, as the case may be. The auditor shall enter the reassessed values on the roll. After being entered on the roll, those reassessed values shall not be subject to review, except by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(d) (1) If no application is made and the assessor determines that within the preceding 12 months a property has suffered damage caused by misfortune or calamity that may qualify the property owner for relief under an ordinance adopted under this section, the assessor shall provide the last known owner of the property with an application for reassessment. The property owner shall file the completed application within 12 months after the occurrence of that damage. Upon receipt of a properly completed, timely filed application, the property shall be reassessed in the same manner as required in subdivision (b).
(2) This subdivision does not apply where the assessor initiated reassessment as provided in subdivision (a) or (l).
(e) The tax rate fixed for property on the roll on which the property so reassessed appeared at the time of the misfortune or calamity, shall be applied to the amount of the reassessment as determined in accordance with this section and the assessee shall be liable for: (1) a prorated portion of the taxes that would have been due on the property for the current fiscal year had the misfortune or calamity not occurred, to be determined on the basis of the number of months in the current fiscal year prior to the misfortune or calamity; plus, (2) a proration of the tax due on the property as reassessed in its damaged or destroyed condition, to be determined on the basis of the number of months in the fiscal year after the damage or destruction, including the month in which the damage was incurred. For purposes of applying the preceding calculation in prorating supplemental taxes, the term “fiscal year” means that portion of the tax year used to determine the adjusted amount of taxes due pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 75.41. If the damage or destruction occurred after January 1 and before the beginning of the next fiscal year, the reassessment shall be utilized to determine the tax liability for the next fiscal year. However, if the property is fully restored during the next fiscal year, taxes due for that year shall be prorated based on the number of months in the year before and after the completion of restoration.
(f) Any tax paid in excess of the total tax due shall be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 5096) of Part 9, as an erroneously collected tax or by order of the board of supervisors without the necessity of a claim being filed pursuant to Chapter 5.
(g) (1) The assessed value of the property in its damaged condition, as determined pursuant to subdivision (b) compounded annually by the inflation factor specified in subdivision (a) of Section 51, shall be the taxable value of the property until it is restored, repaired, reconstructed, or other provisions of the law require the establishment of a new base year value.
(2) If partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair has occurred on any subsequent lien date, the taxable value shall be increased by an amount determined by multiplying the difference between its factored base year value immediately before the calamity and its assessed value in its damaged condition by the percentage of the repair, reconstruction, or restoration completed on that lien date.
(3) (A) On the third lien date following the calamity, if partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair is not progressing in a timely fashion, the assessed value of the property shall be determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 51.
(B) This paragraph shall only apply to property destroyed or damaged in an area or region proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency.
(h) (1) When the property is fully repaired, restored, or reconstructed, the assessor shall make an additional assessment or assessments in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) upon completion of the repair, restoration, or reconstruction:
(A) If the completion of the repair, restoration, or reconstruction occurs on or after January 1, but on or before May 31, then there shall be two additional assessments. The first additional assessment shall be the difference between the new taxable value as of the date of completion and the taxable value on the current roll. The second additional assessment shall be the difference between the new taxable value as of the date of completion and the taxable value to be enrolled on the roll being prepared.
(B) If the completion of the repair, restoration, or reconstruction occurs on or after June 1, but before the succeeding January 1, then the additional assessment shall be the difference between the new taxable value as of the date of completion and the taxable value on the current roll.
(2) On the lien date following completion of the repair, restoration, or reconstruction, the assessor shall enroll the new taxable value of the property as of that lien date.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “new taxable value” shall mean the lesser of the property’s (A) full cash value, or (B) factored base year value or its factored base year value as adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 70.
(i) The assessor may apply Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 75) of Part 0.5 in implementing this section, to the extent that chapter is consistent with this section.
(j) This section applies to all counties, whether operating under a charter or under the general laws of this state.
(k) Any ordinance in effect pursuant to former Section 155.1, 155.13, or 155.14 shall remain in effect according to its terms as if that ordinance was adopted pursuant to this section, subject to the limitations of subdivision (b).
(l) When the assessor does not have the general authority pursuant to subdivision (a) to initiate reassessments, if no application is made and the assessor determines that within the preceding 12 months a property has suffered damage caused by misfortune or calamity, that may qualify the property owner for relief under an ordinance adopted under this section, the assessor, with the approval of the board of supervisors, may reassess the particular property for which approval was granted as provided in subdivision (b) and notify the last known owner of the property of the reassessment.
(m) The amendments made to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply retroactively to the County of Los Angeles with respect to property located in the Porter Ranch neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles that was affected by the methane gas leak in that area in 2015 and 2016. Notwithstanding any other law, in the case of these properties, the application for reassessment may be filed within 12 months of the enactment of this subdivision or within the time specified in the ordinance, whichever is later. This subdivision does not alter any existing law regarding claims or defenses related to diminution of property values. The enactment of this subdivision does not in itself establish a presumption that property values have declined or that any property is in any way “damaged or destroyed” or otherwise “contaminated” for purposes of a civil action related to the methane gas leak that occurred in the Porter Ranch neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles in 2015 and 2016.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances related to the methane gas leak that occurred in the Porter Ranch neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles in 2015 and 2016.
SEC. 3.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to as soon as possible provide necessary relief to the residents of the Porter Ranch neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles that were affected by the methane gas leak that occurred there in 2015 and 2016, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing property tax law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county to provide that every assessee or person liable for taxes on any taxable property whose property was damaged or destroyed without his or her fault may apply for reassessment of that property, as provided. To be eligible for reassessment, existing law requires that the damage or destruction of the property be caused by specified circumstances, including a major misfortune or calamity in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of disaster.
This bill would additionally authorize the board of supervisors of a county to provide for reassessment of property destroyed or damaged by a major misfortune or calamity in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency. The bill would specify that “damage” includes a diminution in the value of property as a result of environmental contamination. The bill would also provide that the amendments made by its provisions would apply retroactively to property located in the Porter Ranch neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles that was affected by the methane gas leak in that area in 2015 and 2016 and that, with respect to these properties, the application for reassessment may be filed within 12 months of the enactment of this bill or within the time specified in the ordinance, whichever is later. The bill would specify that these provisions do not alter existing law regarding claims or defenses related to diminution of property values or establish a presumption that property values have declined or that any property is in any way “damaged or destroyed” or otherwise “contaminated” for purposes of a civil action related to the methane gas leak in the Porter Ranch neighborhood.
Existing law requires the assessed value of the property in its damaged condition, determined as specified, to be the taxable value of the property until it is restored, repaired, reconstructed, or other provisions of the law require the establishment of a new base year value. Existing law, if partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair has occurred on any subsequent lien date, requires the taxable value to be increased by a specified amount.
This bill, for property destroyed or damaged in an area or region proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency, on the 3rd lien date following the calamity, if partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair is not progressing in a timely fashion, would require the assessed value of the property to be determined, as specified.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 170 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
356,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 556.4 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
556.4.
For purposes of this article, information that appears on
any
a
sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device such as, but not limited to, the following, may be used as evidence to establish the fact, and may create an inference, that a person or entity is responsible for the posting of the sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device:
(a) The name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information regarding the real estate broker, real estate brokerage firm, real estate agent, or other person associated with the firm.
(b) The name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information of the owner or lessee of property used for a commercial activity or event.
(c) The name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information of the sponsor or promoter of a sporting event, concert, theatrical performance, or similar activity or event.
SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)On February 10, 2014, the three-judge court overseeing the California prison overcrowding class action case (Coleman v. Brown (2013) 952 F.Supp.2d 901) issued an order that, among other things, requires the state to implement an Elderly Parole Program so that prisoners who are 60 years of age or older and who have been incarcerated at least 25 years on their current sentence will be referred to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) to determine suitability for parole. The BPH implemented this Elderly Parole Program on October 1, 2014.
(b)Under the existing Elderly Parole Program hearings, prisoners who are 60 years of age or older and who have been incarcerated 25 years or more on their current sentence serving either a determinate or indeterminate sentence, and who have not yet had an initial parole suitability hearing are referred by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to the BPH and scheduled for an Elderly Parole Program Suitability hearing.
(c)Under the existing Elderly Parole Program hearings, prisoners who are 60 years of age or older and who have been incarcerated 25 years or more on their current term and who have already been denied parole at the initial suitability hearing are considered for a new hearing under the Elderly Parole Program.
(d)The BPH currently reviews all three-year denials annually to determine if a more prompt parole consideration hearing should be considered. Under the existing Elderly Parole Program, the BPH includes within that annual review whether any prisoner meets the elder parole eligibility criteria, and if so whether to schedule a hearing.
(e)Under the existing Elderly Parole Program, prisoners who have lengthier denial periods can file petitions with the BPH asking that their hearing be advanced because they meet the eligibility criteria for elder parole.
(f)The BPH may deny parole if an elderly prisoner’s release would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Parole suitability hearing decisions for elderly parole inmates are reviewed in the same manner as all other parolees under eligibility consideration, pursuant to criteria specified by Section 2281 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations. However, for all Elderly Parole Program hearings, the BPH risk assessments consider whether age, time served, and diminished physical condition, if any, reduce elderly prisoners’ risk for future violence.
(g)The number of elderly prisoners in California state prisons will continue to increase exponentially. In 2013, the CDCR reported a population of prisoners 50 years of age and older as 27,580 and the population of prisoners 55 years of age and older as 14,856.
(h)Costs associated with geriatric medical needs begin to accumulate at 50 years of age, given that there is an overwhelming consensus that the age of 50 constitutes a point when prisoners are considered elderly. In 2010, the LAO estimated from other state projections that incarcerating elderly offenders costs two to three times more than for the general prison population. In 2010, the average cost of incarcerating an inmate was approximately $51,000.
(i)Older persons have significantly low arrest rates. In 2001, the federal arrest rate for persons 40 to 44, inclusive, years of age was 0.73 percent. The rate decreases by about one-half every five years, dropping to 0.46 percent for persons 45 to 49, inclusive, years of age and 0.26 percent for persons 50 to 54, inclusive, years of age. For persons 50 to 59, inclusive, years of age, the arrest rate plummets to 0.14 percent.
(j)There is a lower risk of recidivism among elderly prisoners, according to CDCR statistics. In 2013, CDCR reported that only 33.8 percent of persons who were 60 years of age and older, returned to prison after one year from being released from prison. Recidivism rates for persons 50 to 54, inclusive, years of age and 55 to 59, inclusive, years of age after one year from being released from prison were 39.9 and 38.3 percent, respectively.

, to read:
3055.
(a)The Elderly Parole Program is hereby established, to be administered by the Board of Parole Hearings.
(b)A prisoner shall be considered for parole under the Elderly Parole Program if he or she meets all of the following conditions:
(1)The prisoner is 50 years of age or older.
(2)The prisoner has served 15 years of his or her sentence.
(3)The prisoner has a reentry plan identifying residential, financial, and social integration plans.
(c)When considering the release of a prisoner specified by subdivision (b) pursuant to Section 3041, the board shall give special consideration to whether age, time served, and diminished physical condition, if any, have reduced the elderly prisoner’s risk for future violence.
(d)When scheduling a parole suitability hearing date pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 3041.5 or when considering a request for an advance hearing pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 3041.5, the board shall consider whether the prisoner meets or will meet the criteria specified in subdivision (b).","Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to place or maintain any sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device for the purpose of advertising on public or private property without lawful permission or consent of the owner. Existing law allows information that appears on the advertisement to be used as evidence to establish the fact that a person or entity is responsible for posting the advertisement.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions.
Existing law requires the Board of Parole Hearings to meet with an inmate during the 6th year prior to the inmate’s minimum eligible parole release date to document the inmate’s activities and conduct pertinent to parole eligibility. Existing law, the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law, as added by Proposition 9 at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, requires the panel, or the board if sitting en banc, to set a release date at the meeting, unless it determines that consideration of the public and victim’s safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration, and that a parole date cannot be fixed at the meeting. Existing law requires the board to schedule the next parole consideration hearing 15, 10, 7, 5, or 3 years after any hearing at which parole is denied. Existing law allows the board to advance a hearing set pursuant to these provisions to an earlier date when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require an additional period of incarceration.
Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, imposes increased penalties for certain recidivist offenders. In particular, it requires that, in addition to any other enhancement or penalty provisions that may apply, if a defendant has 2 or more prior felony convictions, the term for the current felony conviction shall be an indeterminate term of imprisonment in the state prison for life with a minimum term of the greatest of 3 times the term otherwise provided as punishment for each current felony conviction subsequent to the 2 or more prior felony convictions, imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years, or the term determined by the court for the underlying conviction, including any applicable enhancement or punishment provisions. The initiative measure enacting the Three Strikes Law prohibits the Legislature from amending the act except by a statute passed by a
2
3
vote or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.
This bill would establish the Elderly Parole Program, for prisoners who are 50 years of age or older, who have served 15 years of their sentence, and who have a reentry plan identifying residential, financial, and social integration plans. When considering the release of an inmate who meets this criteria, the bill would require the board to consider whether age, time served, and diminished physical condition, if any, have reduced the elderly prisoner’s risk for future violence. The bill would also require the Board of Parole Hearings to consider whether a prisoner will qualify for the program when determining the prisoner’s next parole suitability hearing.","An act to

358,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Article 2.10 (commencing with Section 65891) is added to Chapter 4 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, to read:
Article  2.10. Aquifer Protection
65891.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) Groundwater provides substantial water supplies for many farms and communities across the state, particularly in drier years. While in some parts of the state groundwater is very well managed, in other parts there has been substantial groundwater overdraft.
(b) During California’s record drought, there has been a substantial increase in the extraction of groundwater resulting in impacts to aquifers.
(c) In 2014, California adopted landmark legislation, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Part 2.74 (commencing with Section 10720) of Division 6 of the Water Code), to sustainably manage groundwater resources. The act will not be fully implemented for many years, allowing groundwater overdraft to continue in some regions.
(d) Despite the drought, there has been a substantial and dramatic increase in conversion of existing pastureland and nonirrigated lands to new permanent crops irrigated by new deep groundwater wells. In many parts of the central valley, these new orchards and groundwater wells have caused or contributed to existing groundwater wells drying up. These new groundwater wells exacerbate overdraft in some regions of the state and have harmed and will continue to harm groundwater supplies for existing farms and rural communities and the long-term viability of aquifers.
(e) A number of new developments also rely on individual new wells, further stressing overdrafted groundwater basins.
(f) The number of new wells supplying significant new demands for groundwater has resulted in alarming subsidence in many areas of California. Subsidence threatens statewide resources and infrastructure such as roads, highways, and aqueducts. Importantly, subsidence may also cause permanent damage to aquifers, threatening groundwater resources for future generations.
(g) The lack of protection for aquifers, existing groundwater users, and important infrastructure from the explosive increase in new wells is an issue of statewide importance and requires statewide regulation to avoid undesirable results to groundwater and statewide resources while local communities are working to comply with the provisions of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. Preventing undesirable results in a high- or medium-priority basin pursuant to this article and in furtherance of Section 113 of the Water Code is a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution. Therefore, this act applies to charter cities.
(h) This act is in furtherance of the policy contained in Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution.
65891.1.

(k) “Primary drinking water standards” has the meaning provided in Section 116275 of the Health and Safety Code.
(l) “Probationary basin” has the meaning provided in Section 10735 of the Water Code.
(m) “Special act water district” means an agency created by statute to manage groundwater that is the exclusive local agency within its statutory boundaries with powers to comply with Part 2.74 (commencing with Section 10720) of Division 6 of the Water Code as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 10723 of the Water Code.
(n) “Undesirable result” has the meaning provided in Section 10721 of the Water Code.
65891.2.
(a) A city or county overlying a basin designated as a high- or medium-priority basin shall do both of the following:
(1) By January 1, 2018, establish a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility that requires an applicant for a groundwater extraction permit to demonstrate, based on substantial evidence, that extraction of groundwater from a proposed groundwater extraction facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result.
(2) Prohibit the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for a new groundwater extraction facility in either of the following:
(A) A probationary basin, except if the board determines that part of a probationary basin is being adequately managed, in which case the prohibition on the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for a new groundwater extraction facility shall apply only to those portions of the probationary basin not adequately managed as determined by the board.
(B) A basin designated in Bulletin 118 as a basin subject to critical conditions of overdraft.
(b) A groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility shall not be required for any of the following:
(1) A de minimis extractor.
(2) The replacement of an existing groundwater extraction facility with a new groundwater extraction facility with the same or a lessor extraction capacity. For the purposes of this article, replacement includes the deepening of a groundwater extraction facility.
(3) A groundwater extraction facility constructed to provide drinking water to a water system for the purposes of public health.
(4) A groundwater extraction facility necessary for habitat or wetlands conservation.
(5) A groundwater extraction facility
necessary for a renewable energy project such as utility scale solar.
for a photovoltaic or wind energy generation facility approved on or after January 1, 2017, that demands less than 75 acre-feet of groundwater annually.
(6) A groundwater extraction facility integral to a groundwater conjunctive use or storage program operating under an approved California Environmental Quality Act document.
(c) A city or county overlying a basin designated as a low- or very low priority basin may adopt an ordinance establishing a process for the issuance of groundwater extraction permits for the development of a groundwater extraction facility in accordance with this section.

(b) A fee charged by a city or county to review an application for a groundwater extraction facility shall be determined in accordance with Sections 66014 and 66016.
65891.4.
This article does not require a city or county to establish a new process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility if the city or county has in effect an ordinance adopted before January 1, 2018, that imposes conditions on the development of a new groundwater extraction facility in order to prevent the new groundwater extraction facility from contributing to or creating an undesirable result.
65891.5.
This article does not require a city or county overlying a medium- or high-priority basin to have a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility on or after January 31, 2022, or once the department has evaluated a groundwater sustainability plan for the basin the city or county overlies and determined the plan to be adequate and likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin, whichever comes first.
65891.6.
(a) This article does not apply to a basin for which a court or the State Water Resources Control Board has adjudicated the rights to extract groundwater.
(b) This article does not apply
within the statutory boundaries of
to a basin, or any portion of a basin, managed by
a special act water

district identified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 10723 of the Water Code.
(c) The Legislature finds and declares that the County of Napa’s groundwater conservation ordinance, Napa County Code Chapter 13.15, in conjunction with its water availability analysis policy adopted in May 2015, satisfies the purposes of the requirement in Section 65891.4. Accordingly, this article does not apply to a basin managed by the County of Napa if both the county’s groundwater conservation ordinance and its water availability analysis policy remain in effect in substantially the same form as they existed on January 1, 2016.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","The California Constitution requires the reasonable and beneficial use of water and that the conservation of the water resources of the state is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use of the water in the interest of the people and for the public welfare. Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources and designated as subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified.
This bill, by January 1, 2018, would require a city or county overlying a basin designated as a high- or medium-priority basin to establish a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility that requires an applicant for a groundwater extraction permit to demonstrate, based on substantial evidence, that extraction of groundwater from a proposed groundwater extraction facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result, as prescribed. The bill would prohibit a groundwater extraction facility in a high- or medium-priority basin from being developed without a valid groundwater extraction permit, with certain exceptions. The bill would not require a city or county overlying a medium- or high-priority basin to have a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility on or after January 31, 2022, or once the department has evaluated a groundwater sustainability plan for the basin the city or county overlies and determined the plan to be adequate and likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin, whichever comes first. By increasing the duties of cities and counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Article 2.10 (commencing with Section 65891) to Chapter 4 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, relating to land use."

(3) California spent $102,889 per state mile of highway specifically on maintenance, nearly four times the national average.
(4) California spent $48,754 per state mile of highway specifically on administration, more than four times the national average.
(c) The Legislative Analyst’s Office recommended, in the Capital Outlay Support Program Review report issued in May 2014, that Caltrans should be held accountable for the delivery of State Highway Operation and Protection Program (SHOPP) projects by requiring the California Transportation Commission, acting in an independent oversight role, to review and approve individual SHOPP projects, allocate Capital Outlay Support Program funds for SHOPP, and report on Caltrans’ project delivery performance and Caltrans should also be required to provide necessary project information for SHOPP projects to the California Transportation Commission.

SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law generally provides for the reimbursement of victims and derivative victims of specified types of crimes by the California Victim Compensation Board from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for specified losses suffered as a result of those crimes. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the board to grant from the fund for pecuniary losses, when the board determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation, reimbursement for outpatient psychiatric, psychological, or other mental health counseling-related expenses incurred by the victim or derivative victim, as specified. Existing law sets forth eligibility requirements and limits on the amount of compensation the board may award, and requires the application for compensation to be verified under penalty of perjury.
This bill would extend the board’s authority to grant reimbursement for those outpatient psychiatric, psychological, or other mental health counseling-related expenses until January 1, 2019. By expanding the authorization for the use of moneys in the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation. Because an application for reimbursement is required to be submitted under penalty of perjury, this bill would expand the definition of a crime and thus impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 13957.9 of the Government Code, relating to crime victims, and making an appropriation therefor."

362,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Legislature is committed to reducing recidivism among criminal offenders, ensuring that local governments have adequate funding to achieve this goal, and facilitating the responsible implementation of the criminal justice policies contained in the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(b) California must continue to reinvest its criminal justice resources to support community-based corrections programs, evidence-based practices, and local correctional facilities in order to achieve improved public safety returns on this state’s substantial investment in its criminal justice system.
(c) Realigning low-level felony offenders who do not have prior convictions for serious, violent, or sex offenses to locally run community-based corrections programs, which are strengthened through community-based punishment, evidence-based practices, improved supervision strategies, and enhanced secured capacity, has the potential to improve public safety outcomes for adult felons and facilitate their reintegration back into society. However, local governments have indicated that current resources provided by the state to achieve these goals are inadequate. This lack of resources has resulted in deficiencies in bed space, evidence-based programs, and treatment options. Community-based corrections programs require additional funding to meet the level of need and provide an appropriate level of service for offender populations shifted as a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(d) By enacting the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, the Legislature affirmed its commitment to justice reinvestment and stated that the purpose of justice reinvestment is to manage and allocate criminal justice populations more cost effectively, generating savings that can be reinvested in evidence-based strategies that increase public safety while holding offenders accountable.
(e) In order to properly implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, it is the intent of the Legislature to fully commit to justice reinvestment by using identified state savings generated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and any other necessary funds to provide local governments with maximum flexibility and adequate funding to manage these new offenders in the manner that is in the best interest of public safety, most appropriate to each county, and consistent with principles of justice reinvestment.
(f) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a document in April 2012 entitled “The Future of California Corrections,” sometimes referred to as the “Corrections Blueprint” or the “Blueprint,” detailing the department’s plan to implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation, address public safety, and save billions of dollars. The Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a report in January 2016 entitled “An Update to the Future of California Corrections,” which indicated that, after making certain specified adjustments, the Governor’s proposed budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the 2016–17 fiscal year is one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) less than the pre-Realignment, pre-Blueprint multiyear forecast for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the same fiscal year. Some or all of these savings, and any future savings, should be allocated to counties to mitigate the effects of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
SEC. 3.
Chapter 6.4 (commencing with Section 30030) is added to Division 3 of Title 3 of the Government Code, to read:
CHAPTER  6.4. Realignment Reinvestment Fund
30030.
For purposes of this chapter, “realigned offenders” means offenders sentenced to a county jail or to mandatory supervision, or to both county jail and mandatory supervision, pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, offenders subject to postrelease community supervision pursuant to Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450) of Part 3 of the Penal Code, and any other offenders under county supervision whose supervision would have been the responsibility of the state if the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety had not been enacted.
30031.
(a) (1) The Realignment Reinvestment Fund is hereby established in the State Treasury. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated and shall be used exclusively for the purposes of this chapter.
(2) (A) Beginning in 2017, on or after July 1, and no later than August 31 of each year, the Director of Finance shall calculate both of the following:
(i) The actual net savings to the state for the immediately preceding fiscal year resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(ii) An estimate of the net savings to the state for the current fiscal year resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(B) For the calculation pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Director of Finance shall, to the extent possible, use the same methodology used to determine that the proposed 2016–17 budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) less than the adjusted multiyear forecast for 2016–17, as reflected on page 30 of the report published by the Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in January 2016, entitled “An Update to the Future of California Corrections.” The Director of Finance shall use the same adjustments used in the report when making savings calculations, including adjustments for employee compensation, retirement contributions, Proposition 98 funding, and the activation of the California Health Care facility.
(3) For the 2016–17 fiscal year, the Controller shall transfer one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for allocation pursuant to paragraph (5).
(4) Beginning with the 2017–18 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Controller shall transfer an amount equal to the difference between the amount identified in subparagraph (A) and the amount identified in subparagraph (B) from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for allocation pursuant to paragraph (5).
(A) The estimate of net savings for the current fiscal year calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2).
(B) An adjustment for the immediately preceding fiscal year that is the result of subtracting the amount calculated pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) for that fiscal year from the amount estimated pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) for that fiscal year.
(5) The Controller shall annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county and city and county for deposit in the county’s or city and county’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county’s supervision for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Controller shall consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county.
(b) There shall be established in each county or city and county treasury a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to receive all amounts allocated to a county or city and county for purposes of implementing this chapter.
(c) (1) Each county local Community Corrections Partnership established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1230 of the Penal Code shall recommend a comprehensive, locally run supplemental community-based corrections plan to the county board of supervisors. The purpose of the plan shall be to improve the outcomes of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety. The plan may include, but shall not be limited to, mental health programs, substance abuse programs, transitional housing programs, job placement programs, improved supervision strategies, community-based punishment programs, increased law enforcement staffing in cities and counties, county jail construction, maintenance, and operation, assessment and criminal prosecution of realigned offenders, and supervision or aftercare for offenders sentenced pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code and offenders subject to postrelease community supervision pursuant to Section 3451 of the Penal Code.
(A) The supplemental community-based corrections plan may include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following components:
(i) An assessment of existing law enforcement, probation, education, mental health, health, social services, drug and alcohol, and other services that specifically target realigned offenders and their families.
(ii) An identification and prioritization of the neighborhoods and other areas in the community that face a significant public safety risk from realigned offenders and associated crimes, including, but not limited to, gang activity, burglary, robbery, vandalism, controlled substances sales, firearm-related violence, and substance abuse.
(iii) A local action strategy that provides for a continuum of responses to crime and demonstrates a collaborative and integrated approach for implementing a system of swift, certain, and graduated responses for realigned offenders.
(iv) A schedule of programs identified in clause (iii) that are proposed to be funded pursuant to this subparagraph, including the projected amount of funding for each program.
(v) An accounting of the number of new crimes or violations committed by realigned offenders.
(vi) An evaluation of existing services and any gaps that may exist in those services.
(B) Programs proposed to be funded shall satisfy all of the following requirements:
(i) Be based on evidence-based programs and approaches that have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing crime or programs that improve public safety through incapacitation, prosecution, or treatment of realigned offenders.
(ii) Employ information sharing systems to ensure that county and city actions are fully coordinated and designed to provide data for measuring the success of programs and strategies.
(C) The plan shall also identify the specific objectives of the programs proposed for funding and specified outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of the programs and contain an accounting for all program participants, including those who do not complete the programs. Outcome measures of the programs proposed to be funded shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following when that data is available and relevant to the program:
(i) The rate of arrests per 100,000 population.
(ii) The rate of successful completion of probation and postrelease community supervision.
(iii) The rate of successful completion of restitution and court-ordered community service responsibilities.
(iv) Arrest, incarceration, and probation violation rates of realigned offenders and other program participants.
(v) Quantification of the annual per capita costs of the program.
(D) To assess the effectiveness of programs funded pursuant to this paragraph using the program outcome criteria specified in subparagraph (C), the following periodic reports shall be submitted:
(i) Each county or city and county shall report, beginning October 15, 2017, and annually each October 15 thereafter, to the county board of supervisors and the Board of State and Community Corrections, in a format specified by the board, on the programs funded pursuant to this chapter and program outcomes as specified in subparagraph (C).
(ii) The Board of State and Community Corrections shall compile the local reports and, by March 15, 2018, and by March 15 of each year thereafter, make a report to the Governor and the Legislature on program expenditures within each county and city and county funded pursuant to this section and on the outcomes as specified in subparagraph (C). A report submitted pursuant to this clause shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(2) The supplemental community-based corrections plan shall be voted on by an executive committee of each county’s Community Corrections Partnership consisting of the chief probation officer of the county as chair, a chief of police, the sheriff, the district attorney, the public defender, the presiding judge of the superior court, or his or her designee, and one department representative listed in either subparagraph (G), (H), or (J) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 1230 of the Penal Code, as designated by the county board of supervisors for purposes related to the development and presentation of the plan.
(3) If a supplemental community-based corrections plan has been previously approved by a county’s or city and county’s local Community Corrections Partnership, the plan shall be reviewed annually and modified as needed.
(4) The supplemental community-based corrections plan or modified supplemental community-based corrections plan shall be deemed accepted by the county board of supervisors unless the board rejects the plan by a vote of four-fifths of the board, in which case the plan shall go back to the Community Corrections Partnership for further consideration.
(5) The supplemental community-based corrections plan or modified supplemental community-based corrections plan shall be submitted to the Board of State and Community Corrections no later than October 15 of each year.
(d) The Controller shall allocate funds to local jurisdictions for public safety in accordance with this section as described in subdivision (a).
(e) Funds allocated pursuant to subdivision (c) shall be expended or encumbered in accordance with this chapter no later than June 30 of the following fiscal year. A local agency that has not met the requirement of this subdivision shall remit the unspent moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to the Controller for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund.
(f) Beginning in 2017, and no later than May 1 of each year, the Director of Finance shall, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, develop an estimate of the cost avoidances expected to be realized by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in the current fiscal year that are a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and report those estimates to the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations and to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. A report submitted pursuant to this subdivision shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code. The Legislature may consider each year whether to appropriate funds in augmentation of the moneys otherwise allocated pursuant to this chapter in an amount up to and including the amount of cost avoidances reported pursuant to this subdivision.
30032.
(a) Moneys allocated from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to a recipient entity shall be expended exclusively for services included in the county’s or city and county’s supplemental community-based corrections plan. These moneys shall supplement existing services and shall not be used to supplant any existing funding for law enforcement services or programs or activities included in the supplemental community-based corrections plan provided by that entity.
(b) In no event shall any moneys allocated from the county’s or city and county’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account be expended by a recipient entity to fund any of the following:
(1) Administrative overhead costs in excess of 1 percent of a recipient entity’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account allocation for that fiscal year.
(2) The costs of any capital project or construction project that does not directly support programs or activities included in the supplemental community-based corrections plan.
(c) For purposes of this section, both of the following shall apply:
(1) A “recipient entity” is that entity that actually incurs the expenditures of Realignment Reinvestment Services Account funds allocated pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 30301.
(2) Administrative overhead costs shall only be charged by the recipient entity, as defined in paragraph (1), up to 1 percent of its Realignment Reinvestment Services Account allocation.
30033.
The moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Services Account established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 30031 in each county or city and county shall be expended exclusively as required by this chapter. Moneys allocated from the account shall not be transferred to, or commingled with, the moneys in any other fund in the county or city and county treasury, except that moneys may be transferred from the account to the county’s or city and county’s general fund to the extent necessary to facilitate the appropriation and expenditure of those transferred moneys in the manner required by this chapter.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SECTION 1.
Section 8585.05 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
8585.05.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for the purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)“Agency” or “office” means the Office of Emergency Services.
(b)“California Emergency Management Agency” means the Office of Emergency Services.
(c)“Director” or “secretary” means the Director of Emergency Services.","(1) Existing law, the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and related statutes, requires that certain specified felonies be punished by a term of imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years, and provides for postrelease community supervision by county officials for persons convicted of certain specified felonies upon release from prison or county jail. As part of the realignment of public safety services to local agencies, existing law establishes the Local Revenue Fund 2011 into which specified tax revenues are deposited and are continuously appropriated for the provision of public safety services, as defined.
This bill, the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment, would establish the Realignment Reinvestment Fund in the State Treasury as a continuously appropriated fund. The bill would require the Director of Finance to annually calculate the net savings to the state for the prior fiscal year and an estimate of the net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, as specified. The bill would require the Controller to transfer $1,300,000,000 from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for the 2016–17 fiscal year, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would, beginning in the 2017–18 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, require the Controller to transfer an amount equal to the estimate of net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, adjusted by the difference between the preceding year’s estimate and the calculated prior fiscal year net savings, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would require the Controller to annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county for deposit in the county’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally, based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county’s supervision for the preceding fiscal year. The bill would require the Controller to consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county.
The bill would require a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to be established in each county treasury. The bill would require the moneys be used to implement a comprehensive, locally run, supplemental community-based corrections plan, as specified. The bill would require the supplemental community-based corrections plan to be developed by each county’s local Community Corrections Partnership and to be voted on by an executive committee of each county’s Community Corrections Partnership, as specified. The bill would deem the supplemental community-based corrections plan accepted by the county board of supervisors unless the board rejects the plan by a
4/5
vote. The bill would require each county or city and county to annually report to the county board of supervisors and the Board of State and Community Corrections on the programs funded pursuant to these provisions, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, to develop a yearly estimate of the cost avoidances expected to be realized by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that are a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation and would require the director to report those estimates to the Legislature, as provided.
The bill would require that moneys allocated from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account be expended exclusively for purposes of the bill’s provisions. The bill would require that funds received pursuant to its provisions be expended or encumbered no later than June 30 the following year and would require unspent moneys to be remitted for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
The California Emergency Services Act, among other things, establishes the Office of Emergency Services within the office of the Governor, under the charge of a Director of Emergency Services appointed by the Governor. The act and other existing law set forth the duties and authority of the office and the director with respect to specified emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response activities within the state.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to the act.","An act to amend Section 8585.05 of the Government Code, relating to emergency services.
An act to add Chapter 6.4 (commencing with Section 30030) to Division 3 of Title 3 of the Government Code, relating to criminal justice realignment, and making an appropriation therefor."
363,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 6033) is added to Chapter 5 of Title 7 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, to read:
Article  1.5. Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016
6033.
This article shall be known, and may be cited, as the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016.
6033.2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Legislature is committed to reducing recidivism among criminal offenders, ensuring that local governments have adequate funding to achieve this goal, and facilitating the responsible implementation of the criminal justice policies contained in the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.
(b) By enacting the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, the Legislature affirmed its commitment to justice reinvestment and stated that the purpose of justice reinvestment is to manage criminal justice populations more cost effectively, generating savings that can be reinvested in evidence-based strategies that increase public safety while holding offenders accountable.
(c) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety represents a significant shift of responsibilities. However, the quick and unanticipated nature of the passage of this legislation, in combination with broad county discretion in its implementation, offers a unique opportunity to identify best practices in community corrections and the impacts of correctional decentralization.
(d) The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety did not require counties to collect data on outcome measures, nor did it provide specific resources for data collection that if adequately funded and properly implemented would allow policymakers, researchers, stakeholders, and counties to take advantage of the historic opportunity to study and evaluate the changing felon population and the strategies and interventions that counties employ to reduce recidivism.
(e) The Bureau of State Audits’ September 2013 High Risk report identified the 2011 realignment of criminal justice responsibilities between the state and counties as a “high-risk” policy, citing a lack of “reliable and meaningful realignment data to ensure [the state’s] ability to effectively monitor progress toward achieving intended realignment goals.”
(f) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a document in April 2012 entitled “The Future of California Corrections,” sometimes referred to as the “Corrections Blueprint” or the “Blueprint,” detailing the department’s plan to implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation, address public safety, and save billions of dollars. The Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a report in January 2016 entitled “An Update to the Future of California Corrections,” which indicated that after making certain specified adjustments the Governor’s proposed budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the 2016–17 fiscal year is one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) less than the pre-Realignment, pre-Blueprint multi-year forecast for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the same fiscal year. It is the intent of the Legislature to reinvest some or all of these savings in programs that reduce criminal recidivism, including a program to establish and implement reporting systems that are necessary to facilitate the identification and expansion of programs that provide proven evidence-based local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society.
6033.4.
(a) The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016, which is hereby established, shall be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purpose of establishing and implementing reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven, evidence-based, local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society. The board shall award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12.
(b) For purposes of this article, “board” means the Board of State and Community Corrections.
6033.6.
(a) On or before June 1, 2016, each local community corrections partnership established pursuant to Section 1230 shall report to the board on the county’s capacity to collect and report the data required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12. The report shall include a local plan that identifies the additional resources necessary for that county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12.
(b) The board shall review each assessment submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) and shall prioritize and award grants pursuant to Section 6033.8. Funding shall be used to supplement, rather than supplant, existing programs. Grant funds shall be used for programs that are identified in the local plan submitted pursuant to subdivision (a).
(c) The board shall submit to the Legislature on or before June 15, 2016, a report detailing the estimated need, cost, and schedule for each county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information as required by Sections 6033.10 and 6033.12. The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
6033.8.

This bill would enact the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016. The bill would require the grant program to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purpose of establishing and implementing reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven, evidence-based, local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society.
The bill would authorize the board to award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report specified criminal justice information. The bill would require each local community corrections partnership, on or before June 1, 2016, to report to the board on the county’s capacity to collect and report the data required. The bill requires the board to review each assessment and to prioritize and award grants to the counties.
The bill would require each county to report specified data to the board, on or before January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, pertaining to offenders sentenced as felons to serve in local correctional facilities and felons released from prison to community supervision. The bill would require the board to summarize these data and report the summaries to the Governor and the Legislature, on or before May 15, 2017, and annually thereafter.

SECTION 1.
Section 7200 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
7200.
(a) There is in the Department of Consumer Affairs a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind in whom enforcement of this chapter is vested. The board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Governor. One member shall be the Director of Rehabilitation or his or her designated representative. The remaining members shall be persons who have shown a particular interest in dealing with the problems of persons who are blind or visually impaired and at least three of them shall be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends that date. Notwithstanding any other law, the repeal of this section renders the board subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.
SEC. 2.
Section 7200.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
7200.5.
(a) The board shall have exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses for the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs and for the training of guide dogs for use by persons who are blind or visually impaired. It shall also have exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses to operate schools for the training of guide dogs and the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs.
(b) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, whenever an individual has received training or instruction from a school outside of this state that is certified by the International Guide Dog Federation or a successor entity, as determined by the board, personnel from that school may provide, in this state, any followup services to that individual with respect to the specific guide dog for whom training or instruction was originally provided outside of this state. The personnel from that school shall notify the board on a form prescribed by the board not less than three business days prior to the time the personnel arrive in this state of their intent to provide followup services. If those services are to be provided due to emergency circumstances, as determined by the school, notification may be provided within 24 hours after the personnel arrive in this state. For purposes of making that determination, emergency circumstances include, but are not limited to, injury to a dog that requires determination as to whether it remains safe for the dog to continue working, an accident involving the dog, or certain sudden changes in behavior that imperil the safety of the handler. The board shall permit the personnel to provide the notification electronically and shall not require the personnel to notify the board of the name of the individual who will be receiving the followup services. However, the board may require a school to provide the name of the individual to whom services have been provided if needed for purposes of investigating the personnel from that school who provided these services, so long as the investigation is conducted based upon reasonable grounds for determining that personnel may have provided substandard care.
(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), prior to providing followup services pursuant to paragraph (1), personnel shall have fingerprints on file with the board.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the followup services are provided under emergency circumstances personnel shall have one business day after coming in to the state to meet the requirements of that subparagraph.
(3) Whenever followup services are provided pursuant to paragraph (1), the out-of-state school shall provide written information to the guide dog handler concerning the provisions of this subdivision.
(4) The board may refuse to allow personnel to provide followup services if the personnel have committed any act described in Section 7211.9. During the time the personnel provide followup services to the individual, the personnel shall be subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board, which may include a citation and fine pursuant to the board’s rules and regulations or any other disciplinary action which could be brought against a licensed instructor.
SEC. 3.
Section 7215.7 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:
7215.7.
(a) The board shall prepare a factsheet that shall contain all of the following:
(1) A description of the purposes served by the board.
(2) A description of the board’s role in assisting guide dog users who are victims of alleged guide dog discrimination.
(3) A description of the board’s arbitration procedure under Section 7215.6.
(b) The board shall post the factsheet on its Internet Web site and provide copies to each guide dog school licensed pursuant to this chapter. A school licensed under this chapter shall provide a copy of the factsheet to every student receiving training from that school.
(c) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends that date.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law establishes within the Department of Consumer Affairs a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, which is comprised of 7 members appointed by the Governor.
Existing law requires 2 of the board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
This bill would instead require at least 3 board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
Under existing law, the board has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses for the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs and for the training of guide dogs for use by persons who are blind or visually impaired. Under existing law, the board also has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses to operate schools for the training of guide dogs and the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs. Existing law makes it unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, give, hire, or furnish under any other arrangement, any guide dog or to engage in the business or occupation of training a guide dog unless he or she holds a valid and unimpaired license issued pursuant to the provisions governing guide dogs. A violation of those provisions is a crime.
This bill, whenever an individual has received training or instruction from a specified certified school outside of this state, would authorize personnel from that school to provide that individual with any followup services within this state with respect to the specific guide dog for whom training or instruction was originally provided outside of this state, as specified. The bill would require the personnel, not less than 3 days prior to arriving in this state, to notify the board of their intent to provide those services.
This bill would, if specified conditions are met, authorize followup emergency services. If those services are to be provided due to emergency circumstances, as determined by the school based on specified examples, the bill would authorize that notice to be provided within 24 hours after the personnel arrive in this state. The bill would prohibit the board from requiring the school to provide the name of the individual who will be receiving followup services, however, it would permit the board to require a school to provide the name of the individual to whom services have been provided to investigate personnel providing those services, so long as the investigation is based on reasonable grounds for determining that personnel may have provided substandard care. The bill would also authorize the board to refuse to allow personnel who have committed certain acts for which the board could suspend or revoke a license to provide those services, and would place those personnel under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board while they provide those services. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would require the board to prepare a factsheet regarding various functions of the board, to post that factsheet on its Internet Web site, and to provide copies to each of the licensed guide dog schools. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would also require a licensed guide dog school to provide copies of the factsheet to every student receiving training from that school. Because the failure of a licensed guide dog school to provide those copies and the failure of personnel to provide that notification would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 7200 and 7200.5 of, and to add and repeal Section 7215.7 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to professions and vocations."

SECTION 1.
Section 10003 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
10003.
(a) It shall be the responsibility of a recipient of aid pursuant to this division changing residence from one county to another to promptly notify either the county from which he or she moves or the county to which he or she moves of the change of residence. Recipients of CalWORKs, CalFresh, or Medi-Cal shall have the option to report a change of residence in person, in writing, telephonically, or, if the technology is available, electronically online and shall be advised of these options at the time of application and redetermination or recertification. Within seven business days of notice of a new residence, the notified county shall initiate an intercounty transfer for all benefits under this division that the recipient is receiving, and benefits shall be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month following 30 days after a county was notified pursuant to this section.
(b) To the greatest extent possible, the intercounty transfer process shall be simple and client friendly and minimize workload for county eligibility operations. The process shall ensure the applicant or recipient does not need to provide copies of documents that were previously provided to the prior county of residence, and there is no interruption in benefits.
(c) Case file documents shall be electronically shared between the prior county of residence and the new county of residence, to the extent possible, as specified by the relevant state departments.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 11052.5, the new county of residence shall not interview recipients moving to that county from another county to determine continued eligibility for CalFresh or CalWORKs until the next scheduled recertification pursuant to Section 18910.1 or redetermination pursuant to Section 11265. This section shall not preclude the new county of residence from interviewing CalWORKs recipients regarding welfare-to-work program participation, which is not a requirement for an intercounty transfer of CalWORKs eligibility.
(e) For beneficiaries required to receive services through a Medi-Cal managed care health plan, the following shall apply:
(1) If the beneficiary moves to another county and is still enrolled in a managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved, the beneficiary shall have continued access to emergency services and any other coverage the managed care health plan authorizes out-of-network until the time that the intercounty transfer process pursuant to subdivision (a) is complete and the beneficiary is disenrolled from the managed care health plan.
(2) If the beneficiary moves to another county and is still enrolled in a managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved and needs nonemergent care that same month in the new county, the Medi-Cal Managed Care Ombudsman shall, upon request by the beneficiary or either county, disenroll the beneficiary as an expedited disenrollment from his or her managed care health plan. County-initiated disenrollment using an online form shall be processed no later than three business days after the request is made. Beneficiary-initiated disenrollment by telephone shall be effective no later than two business days after the request is made when the request is made before 5 p.m. Any beneficiary-initiated disenrollment request by phone made after 5 p.m. shall be processed the following business day and be effective no later than two business days after the request is processed.
(3) A beneficiary who is disenrolled from the managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be entitled to the full scope of benefits for which he or she is entitled to in the new county through the fee-for-service delivery system until he or she is enrolled in a managed care health plan in the new county.
(4) If the beneficiary moves to a county that provides Medi-Cal services through a county organized health system, the beneficiary shall be enrolled in that county organized health system plan on the first day of the following month once the new county of residence is reflected in the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System. If a beneficiary moves to a county without a county organized health system, the usual health plan choice process shall apply.
(f) Failure to report a move to a different county within the state in itself shall not constitute a basis for an overpayment.
(g) (1) Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services, without taking any further regulatory action, shall implement, interpret, or make specific this section by means of all-county letters, plan letters, plan or provider bulletins, or similar instructions until the time regulations are adopted. The State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services shall adopt regulations by July 1, 2021, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(2) Beginning June 1, 2017, and notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services shall provide a status report on the adoption of the regulations to the Legislature on a semiannual basis, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, until regulations have been adopted.

The first county shall notify the second county of the recipient’s move as soon as the recipient’s location in the second county is known. The county to which the recipient has moved will be responsible for determining the recipient’s continued eligibility for payment of aid and, to the extent possible, as determined by the Director of Health Services, eligibility for the Medi-Cal program, as of the first day of the month following 30 days after the first county has notified the second county of the recipient’s relocation. The first county shall provide the second county with copies of those documents, as specified by the department, necessary to establish current eligibility and grant amount.
(b) This section shall become inoperative on June 1, 2017, and, as of January 1, 2018, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.

Section 11053.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
11053.2.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the department shall establish a process of intercounty transfer of eligibility for CalFresh benefits provided under Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 18900) of Part 6 when a recipient changes residence from one county to another within the state. The intercounty transfer process shall facilitate a recipient’s move from one county to another without a break in benefits and without requiring a new application to be submitted to the new county of residence.
(b) (1) For CalFresh recipients who are receiving CalWORKs benefits pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200), the intercounty transfer process utilized for CalWORKs shall be used.
(2) For CalFresh recipients who are receiving Medi-Cal benefits pursuant to Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 14000), but are not receiving CalWORKs benefits pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200), the intercounty transfer process utilized for the Medi-Cal program shall be used.
(3) This subdivision shall be implemented no later than April 1, 2011.
(c) For CalFresh recipients who are not receiving CalWORKs or Medi-Cal benefits as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b), an intercounty transfer process shall be developed, in consultation with representatives of county human services departments and advocates for recipients. To the greatest extent possible, the process shall be simple, client friendly, ensure the client does not need to provide copies of documents that were previously provided to the prior county of residence, build on existing processes for the programs described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b), and minimize workload for county eligibility operations. The process developed pursuant to this subdivision shall be implemented no later than July 1, 2011.
(d) Upon the implementation of the intercounty transfer procedures set forth in this section, it shall be the responsibility of a recipient changing residence from one county to another within the state to notify his or her prior county of residence of his or her move. The prior county of residence shall notify the new county of the recipient’s move as soon as the recipient’s location in the new county is known. The new county of residence shall be responsible for determining the recipient’s continued eligibility for payment of CalFresh benefits. To the extent permitted by federal law, the new county of residence shall not be required to interview persons in the CalFresh household to determine continued eligibility until the next scheduled recertification or other regularly scheduled interview.
(e) Notwithstanding the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the department may implement this section through all-county letters, or similar instructions from the director no later than April 1, 2011, with respect to subdivision (b), and no later than July 1, 2011, with respect to subdivision (c).
(f) The department shall adopt regulations as otherwise necessary to implement this section no later than July 1, 2012. Emergency regulations adopted for implementation of this section may be adopted by the director in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

The emergency regulations shall be exempt from review by the Office of Administrative Law. The emergency regulations authorized by this section shall be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for filing with the Secretary of State and shall remain in effect for no more than 180 days.
(g) This section shall become inoperative on June 1, 2017, and, as of January 1, 2018, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.

(a) County residence is not a qualification for aid under any public assistance program.
(b) County responsibility for making aid payments is determined as follows:
(1) The county where the applicant lives shall accept the application and shall be responsible for paying the aid.
(2) Responsibility for payment of aid to any person qualifying for and receiving aid from any county, who moves to another county in this state to make his or her home, shall be transferred to the second county as soon as administratively possible, but not later than the first day of the month following 30 days after notification to the second county.
(c) For purposes of public assistance the county in which an applicant or recipient lives is:
(1) For a patient in a state hospital or institution, voluntary, nonprofit, or proprietary facility or other public or private institution, the county from which he or she was admitted.
(2) For a person who has had to leave the county in which he or she normally lives, solely for the purpose of securing care not otherwise available to him or her in a medical facility, the county in which he or she last maintained a living arrangement outside a medical facility.

(1) The county where the applicant lives shall accept the application and shall be responsible for paying the aid.
(2) Responsibility for payment of aid to a person qualifying for and receiving aid from a county, who moves to another county in this state to make his or her home, shall be transferred to the second county as soon as administratively possible pursuant to the requirements set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 10003.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which, through a combination of state and county funds and federal funds received through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families.
Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services.
Existing law establishes a statewide program to enable eligible low-income persons to receive food stamps under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh. Existing law requires counties to implement the program, including determining eligibility and distributing CalFresh benefits. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and implement a process of intercounty transfer of eligibility for CalFresh benefits, and to take various regulatory actions.
Existing law requires the county where an applicant of a public assistance program lives to be responsible for paying for the aid and requires transfer of the responsibility to pay, when that person moves to another county, to the 2nd county as soon as administratively possible, but not later than the first day of the month following 30 days after notification to the 2nd county.
This bill would instead, commencing June 1, 2017, require the responsibility for payment of aid to transfer to the 2nd county as soon as administratively possible, as specified. The bill would delete provisions relating to the determination of the county of residence for an aid recipient who has been released or discharged from a state hospital.
Under existing law, a recipient of aid who is changing residence from one county to another within the state is required to notify the county paying aid to the recipient of the move, and to apply for a redetermination of eligibility within the new county of residence. Existing law imposes various requirements on the relevant counties, including requiring the county to which the recipient has moved to determine the recipient’s continued eligibility for payment of aid and, to the extent possible, the recipient’s eligibility for the Medi-Cal program.
This bill would make inoperative on June 1, 2017, those provisions relating to the notice and redetermination of aid procedures for when a recipient of aid changes residence from one county to another within the state, including the procedures for intercounty transfer of CalFresh benefits. The bill would instead, commencing June 1, 2017, require the recipient to notify either the county from which he or she moves or the county to which he or she moves of the change of residence and, within 7 business days of notice of a new residence, would require that county to initiate an intercounty transfer for specified public social service benefits. The bill would require that the benefits be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month following 30 days after a county was notified. The bill would prohibit the new county of residence from interviewing recipients from another county to determine continued eligibility for the CalWORKs or CalFresh programs until the next scheduled recertification or redetermination, and would require case file documents to be shared electronically between the prior county of residence and the new county of residence. The bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations by July 1, 2021. The bill would require, beginning June 1, 2017, the departments to provide a status report on the adoption of the regulations to the Legislature on a semiannual basis. Because this bill would impose additional duties on counties with regard to the provision of aid, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend and repeal Sections 11052.6, 11053, and 11053.2 of, to amend, repeal, and add Section 11102 of, and to add Section 10003 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public social services."

(1) At least 10 days before any hearing by the Board of Parole Hearings, the inmate shall be permitted to review the file which will be examined by the board and shall have the opportunity to enter a written response to any material contained in the file.
(2) The inmate shall be permitted to be present, to ask and answer questions, and to speak on his or her own behalf. Neither the inmate nor the attorney for the inmate shall be entitled to ask questions of any person appearing at the hearing pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 3043.
(3) Unless legal counsel is required by some other law, a person designated by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall be present to ensure that all facts relevant to the decision be presented, including, if necessary, contradictory assertions as to matters of fact that have not been resolved by departmental or other procedures.
(4) The inmate and any person described in subdivision (b) of Section 3043 shall be permitted to request and receive a stenographic record of all proceedings.
(5) If the hearing is for the purpose of postponing or rescinding parole, the inmate shall have the rights set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (c) of Section 2932.
(6) The board shall set a date to reconsider whether an inmate should be released on parole that ensures a meaningful consideration of whether the inmate is suitable for release on parole.
(b) (1) Within 10 days following any decision granting parole, the board shall send the inmate a written statement setting forth the reason or reasons for granting parole, the conditions he or she must meet in order to be released, and the consequences of failure to meet those conditions.
(2) Within 20 days following any decision denying parole, the board shall send the inmate a written statement setting forth the reason or reasons for denying parole, and suggest activities in which he or she might participate that will benefit him or her while he or she is incarcerated.
(3) The board shall schedule the next hearing, after considering the views and interests of the victim, as follows:
(A) Fifteen years after any hearing at which parole is denied, unless the board finds by clear and convincing evidence that the criteria relevant to the decision denying parole are such that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require a more lengthy period of incarceration for the inmate than 10 additional years.
(B) Ten years after any hearing at which parole is denied, unless the board finds by clear and convincing evidence that the criteria relevant to the decision denying parole are such that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require a more lengthy period of incarceration for the inmate than seven additional years.
(C) Three years, five years, or seven years after any hearing at which parole is denied, because the criteria relevant to the decision denying parole are such that consideration of the public and victim’s safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration for the inmate, but does not require a more lengthy period of incarceration for the inmate than seven additional years.
(4) The board may in its discretion, after considering the views and interests of the victim, advance a hearing set pursuant to paragraph (3) to an earlier date,
but not less than two years after a hearing at which parole was denied,
when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require the additional period of incarceration of the inmate provided in paragraph (3).
(5) Within 10 days of any board action resulting in the rescinding of parole, the board shall send the inmate a written statement setting forth the reason or reasons for that action, and shall schedule the inmate’s next hearing in accordance with paragraph (3).
(c) The board shall conduct a parole hearing pursuant to this section as a de novo hearing. Findings made and conclusions reached in a prior parole hearing shall be considered in but shall not be deemed to be binding upon subsequent parole hearings for an inmate, but shall be subject to reconsideration based upon changed facts and circumstances. When conducting a hearing, the board shall admit the prior recorded or memorialized testimony or statement of a victim or witness, upon request of the victim or if the victim or witness has died or become unavailable. At each hearing the board shall determine the appropriate action to be taken based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 3041.
(d) (1) An inmate may request that the board exercise its discretion to advance a hearing set pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) to an earlier date, by submitting a written request to the board, with notice, upon request, and a copy to the victim which shall set forth the change in circumstances or new information that establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public safety does not require the additional period of incarceration of the inmate.
(2) The board shall have sole jurisdiction, after considering the views and interests of the victim to determine whether to grant or deny a written request made pursuant to paragraph (1), and its decision shall be subject to review by a court or magistrate only for a manifest abuse of discretion by the board. The board shall have the power to summarily deny a request that does not comply with this subdivision or that does not set forth a change in circumstances or new information as required in paragraph (1) that in the judgment of the board is sufficient to justify the action described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b).
(3) An inmate may make only one written request as provided in paragraph (1) during each three-year period. Following either a summary denial of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1), or the decision of the board after a hearing described in subdivision (a) to deny parole, the inmate shall not be entitled to submit another request for a hearing pursuant to subdivision (a) until a three-year period of time has elapsed from the summary denial or decision of the board.","Existing law, as amended by Proposition 9, the Victim’s Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law, at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, authorizes the Board of Parole Hearings, after considering the views and interests of the victim, to advance a parole hearing that was set after a hearing at which parole was denied to an earlier date when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require the prisoner to serve the additional period of incarceration required as a result of the previously set hearing date. Marsy’s Law authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions by passing a statute with
3/4
of the membership of each house concurring, unless the amendments expand the scope of Marsy’s Law’s provisions, recognize additional rights of crime victims, or further the rights of crime victims, in which case the Legislature may amend its provisions by passing a statute with a majority vote of membership of each house concurring.

SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to develop additional data to better evaluate whether a combined-use highways system is workable in the County of Inyo. It is further the intent of the Legislature that no General Fund moneys be expended for the pilot project established by this act, and the project will be revenue neutral to the state.
SEC. 2.
Section 38026.1 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
38026.1.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (e), the County of Inyo may establish a pilot project to designate combined-use highways on unincorporated county roads in the county for no more than 10 miles so that the combined-use highways can be used to link existing off-highway motor vehicle trails and trailheads on federal Bureau of Land Management or United States Forest Service lands, and to link off-highway motor vehicle recreational-use areas with necessary service and lodging facilities, in order to provide a unified system of trails for off-highway motor vehicles, preserve traffic safety, improve natural resource protection, reduce off-highway vehicle trespass on private land, and minimize impacts on county residents.
(b) A pilot project established pursuant to this section shall do all of the following:
(1) Prescribe a procedure for highway, road, or route selection and designation. The procedure shall be approved by a vote of a majority of the county’s board of supervisors.
(2) Prescribe a procedure for the county to remove a combined-use designation, including a designation that is removed as a result of the conclusion of the pilot program.
(3) In cooperation with the Department of Transportation, establish uniform specifications and symbols for signs, markers, and traffic control devices to control off-highway motor vehicles, including, but not limited to, the following:
(A) Devices to warn of dangerous conditions, obstacles, or hazards.
(B) Designations of the right-of-way for regular vehicular traffic and off-highway motor vehicles.
(C) A description of the nature and destination of the off-highway motor vehicle trail.
(D) Warning signs for pedestrians and motorists of the presence of off-highway motor vehicle traffic.
(4) Require that off-highway motor vehicles subject to the pilot project meet the safety requirements of federal and state law regarding proper drivers’ licensing, helmet usage, and the requirements pursuant to Section 38026.5.
(5) Prohibit off-highway motor vehicles from traveling faster than 35 miles per hour on highways designated under this section.
(6) (A) Prohibit a combined-use highway road segment designated under this section from exceeding 10 miles.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), two or more combined-use highway road segments may share a common starting point or ending point and may partially overlap as long as the resulting network of the highway road segments does not include more than three distinct locations of shared starting or ending points, or both.
(7) Include an opportunity for public comment at a public hearing held by the county in order to evaluate the pilot project.
(c) A pilot project established pursuant to this section may include use of a state highway, subject to the approval of the Department of Transportation, or any crossing of a highway designated pursuant to Section 38025.
(d) (1) By selecting and designating a highway for combined use pursuant to this section, the county agrees to defend and indemnify the state against any and all claims, including legal defense and liability arising from a claim, for any safety-related losses or injuries arising or resulting from use by off-highway motor vehicles of a highway designated as a combined-use highway by the county’s board of supervisors pursuant to this section.
(2) This subdivision does not alter the requirements of subdivision (e).
(e) The county shall not designate a highway for combined use pursuant to this section unless the Commissioner of the Department of the California Highway Patrol finds that designating the highway for combined use would not create a potential traffic safety hazard.
(f) Not later than January 1, 2019, the County of Inyo, in consultation with the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Parks and Recreation, shall prepare and submit to the Legislature a report evaluating the pilot project, and containing all of the following:

(g) (1) A report submitted pursuant to subdivision (f) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(2) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law authorizes an off-highway motor vehicle that has been issued a plate or device to be operated or driven upon a highway under certain circumstances. Existing law authorizes various public entities, and the Director of Parks and Recreation, to designate a highway, or portion thereof, for the combined use of regular vehicular traffic and off-highway motor vehicles if certain requirements are met. Existing law prohibits a highway from being designated for this combined use for a distance of more than 3 miles.
Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the County of Inyo to establish a pilot project that would exempt specified combined-use highways in the unincorporated area in the County of Inyo from this prohibition to link together existing roads in the unincorporated portion of the county to existing trails and trailheads on federal Bureau of Land Management or United States Forest Service lands in order to provide a unified linkage of trail systems for off-highway motor vehicles, as prescribed. Existing law requires the County of Inyo, in consultation with the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Parks and Recreation, to prepare and submit to the Legislature a report evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot project by January 1, 2016, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2020, and would extend the reporting deadline until January 1, 2019. For purposes of the pilot project described above, the bill would prohibit a combined-use highway road segment from exceeding 10 miles, except as specified.","An act to amend Section 38026.1 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

(1) The cancellation is caused by an involuntary transfer or change in the use
which
that
may be made of the land and the land is not immediately suitable, nor will be immediately used, for a purpose
which
that
produces a greater economic return to the owner.
(2) The board or council has determined that it is in the best interests of the program to conserve agricultural land use that the payment be either deferred or is not required.
(3) The waiver or extension of time is approved by the Secretary of the
Natural

(f)  It is the intent of the Legislature that fees paid to cancel a contract do not constitute taxes but are payments that, when made, provide a private benefit that tends to increase the value of the property.
SEC. 2.
Section 10247 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
10247.
(a) The department shall establish a competitive grant program to provide grants and financial assistance to resource conservation districts to aid in the implementation of state programs or projects that improve soil conservation, carbon sequestration in soil, or moisture retention in soil, or other types of projects that improve the quality of agricultural and related land resources.

The amount expended to benefit the owners of habitable structures within a state responsibility area shall be commensurate with the amount collected from the owners within that state responsibility area. All moneys in excess of the costs of administration of the board and the department shall be expended only for fire prevention activities in counties with state responsibility areas.
(b)The fund may also be used to cover the costs of administering this chapter.
(c)It is the intent of the Legislature that the moneys in this fund be fully appropriated to the board and the department each year in order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

The bill would require the Department of Conservation to establish this competitive grant program.
Existing law requires the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to establish a fire prevention fee in an amount not to exceed $150 to be charged on each habitable structure on a parcel that is within a state responsibility area.

The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","The Political Reform Act of 1974 generally requires elected officials, candidates for elective office, and committees formed primarily to support or oppose a candidate for public office or a ballot measure, along with other entities, to file periodic campaign statements. The act requires that these campaign statements contain prescribed information related to campaign contributions and expenditures of the filing entities. Existing law, the Online Disclosure Act, requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Fair Political Practices Commission, to develop online and electronic filing processes for use by these persons and entities.
This bill, in addition, would require the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Commission, to develop and certify for public use an online filing and disclosure system for campaign statements and reports that provides public disclosure of campaign finance and lobbying information in a user-friendly, easily understandable format.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.

CHAPTER  3.1. Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Mitigation
35630.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Ocean acidification and hypoxia, an abnormal deficiency of oxygen in marine environments, are two major threats to ocean and coastal ecosystems globally, and west coast states are particularly vulnerable, according to the April 2016 findings of the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel.
(b) The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel was a binational collaboration of leading scientists from California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia that was convened at the request of the council and the California Ocean Science Trust. The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel’s executive summary report outlines findings, recommendations, and actions to address ocean acidification and hypoxia.
(c) Ocean acidification is caused primarily by global carbon dioxide emissions. Local carbon dioxide emissions and local nutrient inputs can intensify the effects of ocean acidification.
(d) The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel recommends that California and other west coast states actively employ strategies that address local factors that can reduce ocean acidification and hypoxia exposure, including protecting and restoring critical coastal and aquatic habitats.
(e) Eelgrass ecosystems are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world, with particular importance to farmed shellfish aquaculture and other forms of sustainable aquaculture and to commercially and recreationally valuable species, including shellfish, crabs, finfish, waterfowl, and shorebirds.
(f) Eelgrass protection and restoration efforts help promote a healthier ocean for ecosystems and industry.
(g) Since the 1850s, 90 percent of California’s eelgrass acreage has been destroyed, and the remaining 10 percent is continuously exposed to multiple stressors and threats.
(h) Scientific research has shown that eelgrass habitat provides multiple benefits, including the following:
(1) Providing essential habitat for salmon, groundfish, and Pacific herring, providing Dungeness crab nurseries, and supporting commercial fisheries important to California’s coastal economy.
(2) Improving water quality by filtering polluted runoff and by absorbing excess nutrients.
(3) Helping to mitigate hypoxia.
(4) Sequestering carbon in the underlying sediments.
(5) Protecting the shoreline from erosion by absorbing wave energy and helping to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise.
(i) Advancing the protection and restoration of eelgrass beds in California’s coastal environments, based on scientific and evidence-based approaches, is a critical strategy in enhancing California’s ability to cope with ocean acidification and hypoxia.
35632.
(a) To the extent funds are available from bonds or other sources, the council, in consultation with the State Coastal Conservancy and other relevant entities, shall establish and administer the Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Reduction Program for the purpose of achieving the following goals:
(1) Developing demonstration projects to research how important environmental and ecological factors interact across space and time to influence how geographically dispersed eelgrass beds function for carbon dioxide removal and hypoxia reduction.
(2) Generating an inventory of locations where conservation or restoration of aquatic habitats, including eelgrass, can be successfully applied to mitigate ocean acidification and hypoxia.
(3) Incorporating consideration of carbon dioxide removal for eelgrass restoration projects during the habitat restoration planning process in order to fully account for the benefits of long-term carbon storage of habitat restoration in addition to the habitat value.
(4) Supporting science, monitoring, and coordination to ensure that ocean and coastal policy and management in California reflect best readily available science on strategies to reduce ocean acidification and hypoxia to implement this section.
(b) In advancing approaches in the program to remove carbon dioxide from seawater, the council shall consider approaches that provide multiple cobenefits, including, but not limited to, providing essential fish and bird habitat, improving water quality, and mitigating the impacts of sea level rise.

Sec. 670 et seq.) or a child who would become a dependent child except for the receipt of federal Supplemental Security Income benefits pursuant to Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1381 et seq.) shall be deemed to be a dependent child for the purposes of this paragraph.
(E) The provision of care and payment rates under this paragraph shall be governed by Article 15.5 (commencing with Section 8350) of Chapter 2 of Part 6 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code. Parent fees shall be governed by subdivisions (g) and (h) of Section 8263 of the Education Code.
(2) (A) Transportation costs, which shall be governed by regional market rates as determined in accordance with regulations established by the department.
(B) A standard allowance for transportation costs shall be issued in advance to a participant at the beginning of each month in
an
the
amount
that is equal to the cost of a monthly pass for the county public transit system. If a county does not have a public transit system, the participant shall receive
of
one hundred dollars ($100) per month. A participant is entitled to opt out of the standard allowance at any time and make a reimbursement claim for the actual costs of transportation, and may submit this claim to the county by mail, in person,

Notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the department may implement this act through an all-county letter or similar instruction from the director. The all-county letter or similar instruction shall be issued no later than April 1, 2017.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law generally requires a recipient of CalWORKs benefits to participate in welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility for aid. Existing law requires that necessary supportive services be available to participants in welfare-to-work activities, including transportation costs and ancillary expenses, which include the cost of books, as provided in the welfare-to-work plan entered into between the county and the participant.
This bill would require that a standard allowance for transportation costs be advanced to a participant at the beginning of each month
in an amount that is equal to the cost of a monthly pass for the county public transit system, or if a county does not have a public transit system,
in the amount of $100 per month. The bill would also require that a participant who has been assigned to an educational activity in a postsecondary school
full time, as defined by the school,
receive a standard allowance of $500 for books and supplies,
or $250 if the participant has been assigned to an educational activity part time, as defined by the school,

or
or, if the county already has the technological capacity to do so,
via the county’s Internet Web site. By increasing the duties of counties administering these services, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 11323.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to CalWORKs."
376,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The goal of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) is to provide greater levels of gender equity in schools. The results have been higher enrollment in colleges and universities, increased numbers of graduate degrees in science and mathematics, increased participation in athletics, and fairer treatment in cases of sexual and gender harassment. These benefits not only lead to higher self-esteem and enhanced leadership skills, but also to higher rates of graduation and greater levels of career success. Title IX was approved in 1972, yet noncompliance with its requirements is still problematic.
(b) Title IX addresses 10 key areas: Access to Higher Education, Athletics, Career Education, Education for Pregnant and Parenting Students, Employment, Learning Environment, Mathematics and Science, Sexual Harassment, Standardized Testing, and Technology.
(c) On January 20, 2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee held an informational hearing entitled “Attaining Equal Opportunity for Girls in California’s Secondary Schools: How our Schools are Complying with Title IX.” During the hearing, the committee heard from the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights and the State Department of Education.
(d) As demonstrated by testimony provided during the informational hearing, school districts are often unaware that Title IX requires them to do the following:
(1) Appoint a Title IX coordinator at both the district and school levels who is responsible for coordinating the school and school district’s Title IX compliance. The coordinator should not have other responsibilities that create a conflict of interest with his or her role as coordinator.
(2) Adopt and publish rules and procedures on how to receive, investigate, and respond to a complaint filed under Title IX.
(3) Notify all pupils, parents and guardians of pupils, and school staff of their rights under Title IX.
(e) A 2015 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of California report found widespread unawareness among pupils and school administrators of the rights of pregnant and parenting pupils, including an extremely limited knowledge that pregnant pupils and those recovering from childbirth and related medical conditions are entitled to services available to other pupils with temporary medical conditions.
(f) The ACLU report found that only 4 percent of school districts surveyed included “parenting” status within the list of categories in the nondiscrimination board policy, 25 percent of pupil survey respondents indicated that they had been restricted from participating in an extracurricular activity, such as physical education or a sport, due to their pregnancy status, and 13 percent of pupil survey respondents said that they were required by their school district to move to an alternative or continuation school as a result of their pregnancy despite the law requiring that enrollment in separate programs for parenting pupils be strictly voluntary.
(g) Since Title IX was passed 44 years ago, it has been the subject of over 20 proposed amendments, reviews, Supreme Court cases, and other political actions. It is a living, breathing law that benefits countless women and girls. The lack of knowledge of and training on Title IX harms pupils.
SEC. 2.
Section 221.61 is added to the Education Code, immediately following Section 221.6, to read:
221.61.
(a) On or before July 1, 2017, public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools shall post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their Internet Web sites all of the following:
(1) The name and contact information of the Title IX coordinator for that public school, private school, school district, county office of education, or charter school, which shall include the Title IX coordinator’s phone number and email address.
(2) The rights of a pupil and the public and the responsibilities of the public school, private school, school district, county office of education, or charter school under Title IX, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, Internet Web links to information about those rights and responsibilities located on the Internet Web sites of the department’s Office for Equal Opportunity and the United States Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, and the list of rights specified in Section 221.8.
(3) A description of how to file a complaint under Title IX, which shall include all of the following:
(A) An explanation of the statute of limitations within which a complaint must be filed after an alleged incident of discrimination has occurred, and how a complaint may be filed beyond the statute of limitations.
(B) An explanation of how the complaint will be investigated and how the complainant may further pursue the complaint, including, but not limited to, Internet Web links to this information on the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ Internet Web site.
(C) An Internet Web link to the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights complaints form, and the contact information for the office, which shall include the phone number and email address for the office.
(b) On or before April 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, the Superintendent shall send a letter through electronic means to all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools informing them of the requirement specified in subdivision (a) and of their responsibilities under Title IX.
(c) A public school that does not maintain an Internet Web site may comply with subdivision (a) by posting the information specified in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a) on the Internet Web site of its school district or county office of education.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a school or local educational agency to establish an Internet Web site if the school or local educational agency does not already maintain one.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Sex Equity in Education Act, states the policy of the state that elementary and secondary school classes and courses, including nonacademic and elective classes and courses, be conducted without regard to the sex of the pupil enrolled in these classes or courses. Existing federal law, known as Title IX, prohibits a person, on the basis of sex, from being excluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subject to discrimination under, any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
This bill would require, on or before July 1, 2017, all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their Internet Web sites specified information relating to Title IX. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to annually send a letter through electronic means to all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools informing them of the new requirement that would be created by this bill and of their responsibilities under Title IX. Because the bill would impose additional duties on public schools, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 221.61 to the Education Code, relating to educational equity."
377,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California leads the nation in the number of homeless residents with 115,738 people experiencing homelessness at some point, which is 21 percent of the nation’s total. California also leads the nation in the number and ratio of chronically homeless residents with 29,178 chronically homeless residents at any point in time, which is 31 percent of the nation’s total. California also has 10,416 homeless youth, which is 28 percent of the nation’s total.
(b) Homelessness is expensive to the state and local governments. A homeless person receiving general assistance in Los Angeles County, for example, incurs $2,897 per month in crisis response services.
(c) A chronically homeless Californian moving into “supportive housing” is able to reduce costs he or she incurs by almost 80 percent. Moving an individual or family experiencing chronic homelessness to housing stability costs less than the resulting savings in public expenditures.
(d) Following the example of other states, as well as jurisdictions within California, it is the intent of the Legislature to adopt a “Housing First” model for all state programs funding housing for people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. These housing models should address the distinct needs of homeless populations, including unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age.
(e) Housing First is an evidence-based model of ending all types of homelessness and is the most effective approach to ending chronic homelessness. The federal government recognizes that Housing First yields high-housing retention rates, low returns to homelessness, and significant reductions in crisis or institutional care. The federal government also recognizes the value of time-limited housing to address the needs of unaccompanied homeless youth and persons fleeing domestic violence.
(f) Homelessness affects multiple systems in California. Though almost every state with significant homeless populations has established a council to coordinate a Housing First-oriented response to homelessness, California does not have any entity to manage the state’s response to homelessness.
(g) California participated in a federally funded policy academy to reduce chronic homelessness. That policy academy succeeded in revising programs that the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) administers, and in attracting federal funding opportunities requiring collaboration between the HCD and the State Department of Health Care Services. To implement additional successes, it is essential that California have a coordinating council on homelessness.
SEC. 2.
Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 8255) is added to Division 8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
CHAPTER  6.5. Housing First and Coordinating Council
8255.
For purposes of this chapter:
(a) “Coordinating council” means the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council established pursuant to Section 8257.
(b) “Core components of Housing First” means all of the following:
(1) Tenant screening and selection practices that promote accepting applicants regardless of their sobriety or use of substances, completion of treatment, or participation in services.
(2) Applicants are not rejected on the basis of poor credit or financial history, poor or lack of rental history, criminal convictions unrelated to tenancy, or behaviors that indicate a lack of “housing readiness.”
(3) Acceptance of referrals directly from shelters, street outreach, drop-in centers, and other parts of crisis response systems frequented by vulnerable people experiencing homelessness.
(4) Supportive services that emphasize engagement and problem solving over therapeutic goals and service plans that are highly tenant-driven without predetermined goals.
(5) Participation in services or program compliance is not a condition of permanent housing tenancy.
(6) Tenants have a lease and all the rights and responsibilities of tenancy, as outlined in California’s Civil, Health and Safety, and Government codes.
(7) The use of alcohol or drugs in and of itself, without other lease violations, is not a reason for eviction.
(8) In communities with coordinated assessment and entry systems, incentives for funding promote tenant selection plans for supportive housing that prioritize eligible tenants based on criteria other than “first-come-first-serve,” including, but not limited to, the duration or chronicity of homelessness, vulnerability to early mortality, or high utilization of crisis services. Prioritization may include triage tools, developed through local data, to identify high-cost, high-need homeless residents.
(9) Case managers and service coordinators who are trained in and actively employ evidence-based practices for client engagement, including, but not limited to, motivational interviewing and client-centered counseling.
(10) Services are informed by a harm-reduction philosophy that recognizes drug and alcohol use and addiction as a part of tenants’ lives, where tenants are engaged in nonjudgmental communication regarding drug and alcohol use, and where tenants are offered education regarding how to avoid risky behaviors and engage in safer practices, as well as connected to evidence-based treatment if the tenant so chooses.
(11) The project and specific apartment may include special physical features that accommodate disabilities, reduce harm, and promote health and community and independence among tenants.
(c) “Homeless” has the same definition as that term is defined in Section, and move-in assistance.
(e) “State programs” means any programs a California state agency or department funds, implements, or administers for the purpose of providing housing or housing-based services to people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, with the exception of federally funded programs with requirements inconsistent with this chapter or programs that fund emergency shelters.
8256.
(a) Agencies and departments administering state programs created on or after July 1, 2017, shall collaborate with the coordinating council to adopt guidelines and regulations to incorporate core components of Housing First.
(b) By July 1, 2019, agencies and departments administering state programs in existence prior to July 1, 2017, shall collaborate with the coordinating council to revise or adopt guidelines and regulations that incorporate the core components of Housing First, if the existing guidelines and regulations do not already incorporate the core components of Housing First.
8257.

(4) To promote systems integration to increase efficiency and effectiveness while focusing on designing systems to address the needs of people experiencing homelessness, including unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age.
(5) To coordinate existing funding and applications for competitive funding. Any action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall not restructure or change any existing allocations or allocation formulas.
(6) To make policy and procedural recommendations to legislators and other governmental entities.
(7) To identify and seek funding opportunities for state entities that have programs to end homelessness, including, but not limited to, federal and philanthropic funding opportunities, and to facilitate and coordinate those state entities’ efforts to obtain that funding.
(8) To broker agreements between state agencies and departments and between state agencies and departments and local jurisdictions to align and coordinate resources, reduce administrative burdens of accessing existing resources, and foster common applications for services, operating, and capital funding.
(9) To serve as a statewide facilitator, coordinator, and policy development resource on ending homelessness in California.
(10) To report to the Governor, federal Cabinet members, and the Legislature on homelessness and work to reduce homelessness.
(11) To ensure accountability and results in meeting the strategies and goals of the council.
(12) To identify and implement strategies to fight homelessness in small communities and rural areas.
(13) To create a statewide data system or warehouse that collects local data through Homeless Management Information Systems, with the ultimate goal of matching data on homelessness to programs impacting homeless recipients of state programs, such as Medi-Cal (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 14000) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and CalWORKS (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code).

(K) State advocates or other members of the public or state agencies, according to the Governor’s discretion.
(2) The Senate Committee on Rules and the Speaker of the Assembly shall each appoint one representative of the council from two different stakeholder organizations.
(3) The council may, at its discretion, invite stakeholders, individuals who have experienced homelessness, members of philanthropic communities, and experts to participate in meetings or provide information to the council.
(d) The council shall hold public meetings at least once every quarter.
(e) The members of the council shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor.

(a) In the last decade, there has been a 70-percent drop in the number of people preparing to become California teachers. Last year, 22,000 new credentialed teachers were needed, but only 15,000 were acquired.
(b) California has the highest pupil-teacher ratio in the nation, and the gap widened during the budget cuts. By 2013, the state's pupil-teacher ratio reached 24 to 1, compared to the national average of 16 to 1.
(c) According to the California Teachers Association, nearly one in three teachers leave the profession within seven years, 13 percent of teachers leave the profession by the end of their second year, and, every year, 10 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools transfer to other schools.
(d) California’s registered voters consider the shortage of K–12 teachers a very serious problem, according to a poll commissioned by EdSource and the Learning Policy Institute. The survey of 1,002 registered voters statewide found there is strong support (85 percent) for having the state offer additional scholarships or partially forgive a teacher’s college loans as a way to increase the number of those entering the teaching profession.
(e) A 1997 study by S. Paul Wright, Sandra P. Horn, and William L. Sanders studied teachers and their classroom effects on pupil achievement. Through their results, they found that the most important factor affecting pupil achievement is the teacher, and that improving the effectiveness of teachers can improve education for children (Wright, Horn, and Sanders, 1997). A 2011 study conducted by Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff suggested that pupils with effective teachers are more likely to attend college, attend higher-ranked colleges, earn higher salaries, live in higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods, and save more for retirement.
(f) A study published by the Learning Policy Institute, Addressing California’s Emerging Teacher Shortage: An Analysis of Sources and Solutions, reported that in mathematics and science, the number of credentials awarded to new, fully prepared teachers plunged by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, over the last four years (Linda Darling-Hammond, Roberta Furger, Patrick M. Shields, and Leib Sutcher, 2016). Consequently, the amount of underprepared mathematics and science teachers, such as those with temporary permits and waivers and intern credentials, increased by 23 percent and 51 percent, respectively (Darling-Hammond, Furger, Shields, and Sutcher, 2016). In special education, the number of credentials issued decreased by 21 percent between school years 2011–12 and school year 2013–14, while substandard permits and credentials decreased by 10 percent. Nearly one-half of the special education teachers licensed in California in school year 2013–14 lacked full preparation for teaching (Darling-Hammond, Furger, Shields, and Sutcher, 2016).
SEC. 2.
Section 33333.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:

The state board is required to approve a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The state board is also required to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.
This bill would require the state board, no later than January 1, 2018, to approve and begin implementing that comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants to achieve a reduction in methane by 40%, hydrofluorocarbon gases by 40%, and anthropogenic black carbon by 50% below 2013 levels by 2030, as specified. The bill also would establish specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills.
This bill would require the state board, in consultation with the Department of Food and Agriculture, to adopt regulations to reduce methane emissions from livestock manure management operations and dairy manure management operations, as specified. The bill would require the state board to take certain actions prior to adopting those regulations. This bill would require the regulations to take effect on or after January 1, 2024, if the state board, in consultation with the department, makes certain determinations.
This bill would require the state board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to undertake various actions related to reducing short-lived climate pollutants in the state. The bill would require state agencies to consider and, as appropriate, adopt policies and incentives to significantly increase the sustainable production and use of renewable gas.
(2) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which is administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, establishes an integrated waste management program that requires each county and city and county to prepare and submit to the department a countywide integrated waste management plan.
The bill would require the department, in consultation with the state board, to adopt regulations that achieve the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize local jurisdictions to charge and collect fees to recover the local jurisdiction’s costs incurred in complying with the regulations. The bill would require, no later than July 1, 2020, the department, in consultation with the state board, to analyze the progress that the waste sector, state government, and local governments have made in achieving the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize the department, depending on the outcome of that analysis, to amend the regulations to include incentives or additional requirements, as specified. By adding to the duties of local governments related to organic waste in landfills, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Sections 39730.5, 39730.6, 39730.7, and 39730.8 to the Health and Safety Code, and to add Chapter 13.1 (commencing with Section 42652) to Part 3 of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, relating to methane emissions."
380,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1) According to a national study, false confessions extracted during police questioning of suspects have been identified as a leading cause of a wrongful conviction. Although threats and coercion sometimes lead innocent people to confess, even the most standardized interrogations can result in a false confession or admission. Mentally ill or mentally disabled persons are particularly vulnerable, and some confess to crimes because they want to please authority figures or to protect another person. Additionally, innocent people may come to believe that they will receive a harsher sentence, or even the death penalty, unless they confess to the alleged crime.
(2) Three injustices result from false confessions. First, a false confession can result in an innocent person being incarcerated. Second, when an innocent person is incarcerated, the criminal investigations end and the real perpetrator remains free to commit similar or potentially worse crimes. Third, victims’ families are subjected to double the trauma: the loss of, or injury occurring to, a loved one and the guilt over the conviction of an innocent person. Mandating electronic recording of custodial interrogations of both adults and juveniles will improve criminal investigation techniques, reduce the likelihood of wrongful convictions, and further the cause of justice in California.
(3) Evidence of a defendant’s alleged statement or confession is one of the most significant pieces of evidence in any criminal trial. Although confessions and admissions are the most accurate evidence used to solve countless crimes, they can also lead to wrongful convictions. When there is a complete recording of the entire interrogation that produced such a statement or confession, the factfinder can evaluate its precise contents and any alleged coercive influences that may have produced it.
(b) For these reasons, it is the intent of the Legislature to require electronic recording of custodial interrogations of both adults and juveniles. Recording interrogations decreases wrongful convictions based on false confessions and enhances public confidence in the criminal justice process. Properly recorded interrogations provide the best evidence of the communications that occurred during an interrogation, prevent disputes about how an officer conducted himself or herself or treated a suspect during the course of an interrogation, prevent a defendant from lying about the account of events he or she originally provided to law enforcement, and spare judges and jurors the time necessary and the need to assess which account of an interrogation to believe.

Section 859.5 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
859.5.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a custodial interrogation of any person, including an adult or a minor, who is in a fixed place of detention, and suspected of committing murder, as listed in Section 187 or 189 of this code, or paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, shall be electronically recorded in its entirety. A statement that is electronically recorded as required pursuant to this section creates a rebuttable presumption that the electronically recorded statement was, in fact, given and was accurately recorded by the prosecution’s witnesses, provided that the electronic recording was made of the custodial interrogation in its entirety and the statement is otherwise admissible.
(b) The requirement for the electronic recordation of a custodial interrogation pursuant to this section shall not apply under any of the following circumstances:
(1) Electronic recording is not feasible because of exigent circumstances. An explanation of the exigent circumstances shall be documented in the police report.
(2) The person to be interrogated states that he or she will speak to a law enforcement officer only if the interrogation is not electronically recorded. If feasible, that statement shall be electronically recorded. The requirement also does not apply if the person being interrogated indicates during interrogation that he or she will not participate in further interrogation unless electronic recording ceases. If the person being interrogated refuses to record any statement, the officer shall document that refusal in writing.
(3) The custodial interrogation occurred in another jurisdiction and was conducted by law enforcement officers of that jurisdiction in compliance with the law of that jurisdiction, unless the interrogation was conducted with intent to avoid the requirements of this section.
(4) The interrogation occurs when no law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation has knowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead an officer to reasonably believe that the individual being interrogated may have committed murder for which this section requires that a custodial interrogation be recorded. If during a custodial interrogation, the individual reveals facts and circumstances giving a law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation reason to believe that murder has been committed, continued custodial interrogation concerning that offense shall be electronically recorded pursuant to this section.
(5) A law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation or the officer’s superior reasonably believes that electronic recording would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated, or another individual. An explanation of the circumstances shall be documented in the police report.
(6) The failure to create an electronic recording of the entire custodial interrogation was the result of a malfunction of the recording device, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement was not feasible.
(7) The questions presented to a person by law enforcement personnel and the person’s responsive statements were part of a routine processing or booking of that person. Electronic recording is not required for spontaneous statements made in response to questions asked during the routine processing of the arrest of the person.
(8) The interrogation of a person who is in custody on a charge of a violation of Section 187 or 189 of this code or paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code if the interrogation is not related to any of these offenses. If, during the interrogation, any information concerning one of these offenses is raised or mentioned, continued custodial interrogation concerning that offense shall be electronically recorded pursuant to this section.
(c) If the prosecution relies on an exception in subdivision (b) to justify a failure to make an electronic recording of a custodial interrogation, the prosecution shall show by clear and convincing evidence that the exception applies.
(d) A person’s statements that were not electronically recorded pursuant to this section may be admitted into evidence in a criminal proceeding or in a juvenile court proceeding, as applicable, if the court finds that all of the following apply:
(1) The statements are admissible under applicable rules of evidence.
(2) The prosecution has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the statements were made voluntarily.
(3) Law enforcement personnel made a contemporaneous audio or audio and visual recording of the reason for not making an electronic recording of the statements. This provision does not apply if it was not feasible for law enforcement personnel to make that recording.
(4) The prosecution has proven by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the circumstances described in subdivision (b) existed at the time of the custodial interrogation.
(e) Unless the court finds that an exception in subdivision (b) applies, all of the following remedies shall be granted as relief for noncompliance:
(1) Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall be considered by the court in adjudicating motions to suppress a statement of a defendant made during or after a custodial interrogation.
(2) Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall be admissible in support of claims that a defendant’s statement was involuntary or is unreliable, provided the evidence is otherwise admissible.
(3) If the court finds that a defendant was subject to a custodial interrogation in violation of subdivision (a), the court shall provide the jury with an instruction, to be developed by the Judicial Council, that advises the jury to view with caution the statements made in that custodial interrogation.
(f) The interrogating entity shall maintain the original or an exact copy of an electronic recording made of a custodial interrogation until a conviction for any offense relating to the interrogation is final and all direct and habeas corpus appeals are exhausted or the prosecution for that offense is barred by law or, in a juvenile court proceeding, as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) of Section 626.8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The interrogating entity may make one or more true, accurate, and complete copies of the electronic recording in a different format.
(g) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Custodial interrogation” means any interrogation in a fixed place of detention involving a law enforcement officer’s questioning that is reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses, and in which a reasonable person in the subject’s position would consider himself or herself to be in custody, beginning when a person should have been advised of his or her constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent, the right to have counsel present during any interrogation, and the right to have counsel appointed if the person is unable to afford counsel, and ending when the questioning has completely finished.
(2) (A) For the purposes of the custodial interrogation of a minor, pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), “electronically recorded,” “electronic recordation,” and “electronic recording” refer to a video recording that accurately records a custodial interrogation.
(B) For the purposes of the custodial interrogation of an adult, pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), “electronically recorded,” “electronic recordation,” and “electronic recording” refer to a video or audio recording that accurately records a custodial interrogation. The Legislature encourages law enforcement agencies to use video recording when available.
(3) “Fixed place of detention” means a fixed location under the control of a law enforcement agency where an individual is held in detention in connection with a criminal offense that has been, or may be, filed against that person, including a jail, police or sheriff’s station, holding cell, correctional or detention facility, juvenile hall, or a facility of the Division of Juvenile Facilities.
(4) “Law enforcement officer” means a person employed by a law enforcement agency whose duties include enforcing criminal laws or investigating criminal activity, or any other person who is acting at the request or direction of that person.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the electronic recording of the entire custodial interrogation of a minor who is in a fixed place of detention, as defined, and who, at the time of the interrogation, is suspected of committing or accused of committing murder. Existing law sets forth various exceptions from this requirement, including if the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation or his or her superior reasonably believes that electronic recording would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated, or another individual. Existing law requires the prosecution to show by clear and convincing evidence that an exception applies to justify the failure to make that electronic recording. Existing law requires the interrogating entity to maintain the original or an exact copy of an electronic recording made of the interrogation until the final conclusion of the proceedings, as specified. Existing law additionally requires the court to provide jury instructions developed by the Judicial Council if the court finds that a defendant was subjected to a custodial interrogation in violation of the above-mentioned provisions.
This bill would make this electronic recording requirement applicable to the custodial interrogation of any person suspected of committing murder. By imposing new requirements on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would exempt from the electronic recording requirement the interrogation of a person who is in custody on a charge of murder if the interrogation is not related to the commission of murder, as specified.
Existing law defines “electronic recording” for these provisions as a video recording that accurately records a custodial interrogation.
This bill would specify that the above definition applies only to the custodial interrogation of a minor. The bill would expand the definition to include a video or audio recording in the case of the custodial interrogation of an adult and would express the Legislature’s encouragement that law enforcement agencies use video recording when available.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the above provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 859.5 of the Penal Code, relating to interrogation."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act, imposes civil penalties for a person engaged in the retail sale of tobacco products who sells, offers for sale, or displays for sale any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia by self-service display, except as specified. Existing law makes these penalties inapplicable to the display in a tobacco store of cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, or dipping tobacco, as provided, and defines “tobacco store” to mean a retail business that meets specified requirements, including that it does not permit any person under 18 years of age to be present or enter the premises at any time, unless accompanied by the person’s parent or legal guardian.
This bill would revise the definition of “tobacco store” by raising the age of persons not permitted to be present or enter the premises at any time, unless accompanied by the person’s parent or legal guardian, from 18 to 21 years of age.
Existing law, the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003, requires a retailer to obtain a license from the State Board of Equalization to engage in the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products in this state and defines a retailer as a person who engages in this state in the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products directly to the public from a retail location. The act defines a “retail location” as both any building from which cigarettes or tobacco products are sold at retail and a vending machine.
The act also defines “tobacco products” to include, but not be limited to, all forms of cigars, smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, and any other articles or products made of, or containing at least 50%
, tobacco, but does not include cigarettes. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill
would,
would expand the definition of “tobacco products” to include a product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine, as specified, an electronic device that delivers nicotine or other vaporized liquids to the person inhaling from the device, and any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. The bill would,
beginning January 1, 2019, revise the definition of a “retail location” to mean a tobacco store that is a retail business that, among other things, generates more than 60% of its gross revenues annually from the sale of tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia.
By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

54.27.

(1) Include the attorney’s State Bar license number in the prelitigation letter.
(2) Within five business days of providing the prelitigation letter, send a copy of the prelitigation letter to the California Commission on Disability Access.
(b) An attorney who sends or serves a complaint against an education entity shall do both of the following:
(1) Send a copy of the complaint and submit information about the complaint in a standard format specified by the California Commission on Disability Access to the commission within five business days of sending or serving the complaint.
(2) Notify the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days of judgment, settlement, or dismissal of the claim or claims alleged in the complaint of the following information in a standard format specified by the commission:
(A) The date of the judgment, settlement, or dismissal.
(B) Whether or not the construction-related accessibility violations alleged in the complaint were remedied in whole or in part after the plaintiff filed a complaint.
(C) If the construction-related accessibility violations alleged in the complaint were not remedied in whole or in part after the plaintiff filed a complaint, whether or not another favorable result was achieved after the plaintiff filed the complaint.
(c) A violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) or subdivision (b) shall constitute cause for the imposition of discipline of an attorney if a copy of the prelitigation letter, complaint, or notification of a case outcome is not sent to the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days. In the event the State Bar receives information indicating that an attorney has failed to send a copy of the prelitigation letter, complaint, or notification of a case outcome to the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days, the State Bar shall investigate to determine whether paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) or subdivision (b) has been violated.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), an attorney is not required to send to the California Commission on Disability Access a copy of any subsequent prelitigation letter or amended complaint in the same dispute following the initial prelitigation letter or complaint, unless that subsequent prelitigation letter or amended complaint alleges a new construction-related accessibility claim.
(e) A prelitigation letter or notification of a case outcome sent to the California Commission on Disability Access shall be for the informational purposes of Section 8299.08 of the Government Code.

The Legislature finds and declares that qualified legal services projects and support centers are extensively regulated by the State Bar of California, and that there is no evidence of any abusive use of demand letters or complaints by these organizations. The Legislature further finds that, in light of the evidence of the extraordinarily small number of construction-related accessibility cases brought by regulated legal services programs, and given the resources of those programs, exempting regulated legal services programs from the requirements of this section to report to the California Commission on Disability Access will not affect the purpose of the reporting to, and tabulation by, the commission of all other construction-related accessibility claims.
(h) Nothing in this section applies to a claim for money or damages against a public entity governed by Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title 1 of the Government Code or makes the requirements of this section applicable to such a claim.
(i) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Complaint” means a civil complaint that is filed or is to be filed with a court and is sent to or served upon a defendant on the basis of one or more construction-related accessibility claims.
(2) “Construction-related accessibility claim” or “claim” means any claim of a violation of any construction-related accessibility standard, as defined in paragraph (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.52, with respect to a public building, public facility, or other public place of an education entity. “Construction-related accessibility claim” does not include a claim of interference with housing within the meaning of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 54.1, or any claim of interference caused by something other than the construction-related accessibility condition of the property, including, but not limited to, the conduct of any person.
(3) “Education entity” means the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University and the California State University, the California Community Colleges Office of the Chancellor and the California Community Colleges, a K-12 school district, or any local education agency.
(4) “Prelitigation letter” means a prelitigation written document that alleges the site is in violation of one or more construction-related accessibility standards, as defined in paragraph (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.52 and is provided to the education entity whether or not the attorney intends to file a complaint, or eventually files a complaint, in state or federal court. A prelitigation letter does not include a claim for money or damages against a local public entity governed by Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title 1 of the Government Code.

(c) The commission shall, on a quarterly basis, identify and tabulate the number of demand letters and complaints received by the commission. The commission shall further ascertain whether a complaint was filed in state or federal court and tabulate the number of complaints filed in state or federal court, respectively.

No increase in tuition or reduction in course sections offered shall be adopted because of investment losses sustained as a result of this section.","Existing law authorizes the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest certain money received by the California State University in eligible securities and in investment certificates or withdrawal shares in federal or state credit unions doing business in this state as long as any money invested in this manner is fully insured by the National Credit Union Administration.
This bill would authorize the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest that money in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in United States registered real estate investment trusts. The bill would impose specified requirements on the Trustees of the California State University relating to those types of investments.
Existing law establishes the California State University Special Projects Fund, which consists of grants, revenues, and funds that are appropriated for the operation, support, and development of research, workshops, conferences, institutes, and special projects in the California State University.

Because the bill would authorize the expenditure of moneys from a continuously appropriated fund for new purposes, it would make an appropriation.
This bill would limit the total amount invested in these mutual funds and real estate investment trusts to specified amounts for each fiscal year, until, commencing with the 2019–20 fiscal year, up to 30% of that money could be invested in these asset categories.

(b) Prior to approving the plan described in subdivision (a), the commission shall do all of the following:
(1) Evaluate the best available technological and economic information to ensure that data collection and its use is feasible and achievable at a reasonable cost to government, industry, and homeowners.
(2) Consider the impact of the plan on all of the following:
(A) Property owners.
(B) The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry, including manufacturers, distributors, and contractors.

Section 399.4 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
399.4.
(a) (1) In order to ensure that prudent investments in energy efficiency continue to be made that produce cost-effective energy savings, reduce customer demand, and contribute to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical distribution grid, it is the policy of this state and the intent of the Legislature that the commission shall supervise the administration of cost-effective energy efficiency programs authorized pursuant to its statutory authority, including Sections 381, 381.1, 381.2, 381.5, 382, 384.5, 400, 454.5, 454.55, 454.56, 589, 701.1, 749, and 769, Article 10 (commencing with Section 890) of Chapter 4, and Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 2781) of Part 2.
(2) As used in this section, the term “energy efficiency” includes, but is not limited to, cost-effective activities to achieve peak load reduction that improve end-use efficiency, lower customers’ bills, and reduce system needs.
(b) (1) If a customer or contractor is the recipient of a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for an energy efficiency improvement or installation of energy efficient components, equipment, or appliances in a building, the public utility shall provide the rebate or incentive only if the customer or contractor certifies that the improvement or installation has complied with any applicable permitting requirements, including any applicable specifications or requirements set forth in the California Building Standards Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations), and, if a contractor performed the installation or improvement, that the contractor holds the appropriate license for the work performed.
(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), if a customer or contractor is the recipient of a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for the purchase or installation of central air-conditioning or a heat pump, and their related fans, the public utility shall provide the rebate or incentive only if the customer or contractor provides proof of permit closure. The public utility is not responsible for verifying the proof of permit closure documentation provided by the customer or contractor.
(3) This subdivision does not imply or create authority or responsibility, or expand existing authority or responsibility, of a public utility for the enforcement of the building energy and water efficiency standards adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 25402 of the Public Resources Code, or appliance efficiency standards and certification requirements adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 25402 of the Public Resources Code.
(4) Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the authority of the commission to impose any additional requirements on a recipient of any rebate or incentive.
(c) The commission, in evaluating energy efficiency investments under its statutory authority, shall also ensure that local and regional interests, multifamily dwellings, and energy service industry capabilities are incorporated into program portfolio design and that local governments, community-based organizations, and energy efficiency service providers are encouraged to participate in program implementation where appropriate.
(d) The commission, in a new or existing proceeding, shall review and update its policies governing energy efficiency programs funded by utility customers to facilitate achieving the targets established pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 25310 of the Public Resources Code. In updating its policies, the commission shall, at a minimum, do all of the following:
(1) Authorize market transformation programs with appropriate levels of funding to achieve deeper energy efficiency savings.
(2) Authorize pay for performance programs that link incentives directly to measured energy savings. As part of pay for performance programs authorized by the commission, customers should be reasonably compensated for developing and implementing an energy efficiency plan, with a portion of their incentive reserved pending post project measurement results.
(3) Authorize programs to achieve deeper savings through operational, behavioral, and retrocommissioning activities.
(4) Ensure that customers have certainty in the values and methodology used to determine energy efficiency incentives by basing the amount of any incentives provided by gas and electrical corporations on the values and methodology contained in the executed customer agreement. Incentive payments shall be based on measured results.","Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) to prescribe, by regulation, building design and construction standards and energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and nonresidential buildings. Existing law requires the Energy Commission to prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency to promote the use of energy-efficient and water-efficient appliances whose use requires a significant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. Existing law requires that the minimum levels of operating efficiency be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water consumption growth rates. Existing law prohibits a new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the operating efficiency standards to be sold or offered for sale in the state unless it is certified by the manufacturer to be in compliance with those standards.
This bill would require the Energy Commission, by January 1, 2019, to approve a plan that will promote compliance with specified regulations in the installation of central air conditioning and heat pumps. The bill would authorize the Energy Commission to adopt regulations to increase compliance with permitting and inspection requirements for central air conditioning and heat pumps, and associated sales and installations, consistent with that plan.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Reliable Electric Service Investments Act states the intent of the Legislature that the Public Utilities Commission continue to administer cost-effective energy efficiency programs that produce cost-effective energy savings, reduce customer demand, and contribute to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical distribution grid. Under the act, in order to receive a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for an energy efficiency improvement or for the installation of energy efficient components, equipment, or appliances in buildings, the recipient is required to certify that the improvement or installation complied with any applicable permitting requirements and, if a contractor performed the installation or improvement, that the contractor holds the appropriate license for the work performed.
This bill would limit the application of the above energy efficiency rebate and incentive provisions to customer or contractor recipients. The bill would require a customer or contractor to certify that an energy efficiency improvement or installation complies with any applicable specifications or requirements set forth in the California Building Standards Code in order to receive a rebate or incentive. The bill would require a customer or contractor receiving a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for purchasing or installing central air conditioning or a heat pump, and their related fans, to additionally provide a proof of permit closure. The bill would also more specifically identify the Public Utility Commission’s statutory authority for supervising cost-effective energy efficiency programs.","An act to add Section 25402.12 to the Public Resources Code, and to amend Section 399.4 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

(c) A designation under subdivision (a) shall be made for a taxable year on the original return for that taxable year and once made shall be irrevocable. If payments and credits reported on the return, together with any other credits associated with the individual’s account, do not exceed the individual’s tax liability, the return shall be treated as though no designation has been made.
(d) (1) The Franchise Tax Board shall revise the form of the return to include a space labeled “Revive the Salton Sea Fund” to allow for the designation permitted under subdivision (a). The form shall also include in the instructions information that the contribution may be in the amount of one dollar ($1) or more and that the contribution shall be used to fund all of the following:

There is hereby established in the State Treasury the Revive the Salton Sea Fund to receive contributions made pursuant tocal agencies, nonprofit organizations, and projects identified as necessary for the restoration and maintenance of the Salton Sea, including projects identified by the Salton Sea Authority.
(B) Up to 5 percent of the funds to the Natural Resources Agency for development of a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness through activities that will promote the charitable tax deduction for the fund and seek continued contributions.

(C) Funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall not be used for administrative costs.
(b) Money in the Revive the Salton Sea Fund shall not be used to supplant state General Fund money for any purpose.
18738.

(B) Provide written notification to the Natural Resources Agency of the amount determined in subparagraph (A).
(C) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Franchise Tax Board shall estimate the amount of contributions to be received by using the actual amounts received and an estimate of the contributions that will be received by the end of that calendar year.
(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article shall be inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year and shall be repealed on December 1 of that year.
(3) For purposes of this section, the minimum contribution amount for a calendar year means two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the second calendar year after the first appearance of the Revive the Salton Sea Fund on the personal income tax return or the minimum contribution amount as adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c).
(c) For each calendar year, beginning with the third calendar year after the first appearance of the Revive the Salton Sea Fund on the personal income tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall adjust, on or before September 1 of that calendar year, the minimum contribution amount specified in subdivision (b) as follows:
(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.","Existing law authorizes an individual taxpayer to contribute amounts in excess of his or her personal income tax liability for the support of specified funds. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would allow an individual to designate on his or her tax return that a specified amount in excess of his or her tax liability be transferred to the Revive the Salton Sea Fund, which would be created by this bill. The bill would prohibit a voluntary contribution designation for the Revive the Salton Sea Fund from being added on the tax return until another voluntary contribution designation is removed or a space is available and would require, once the designation is added, specified information to be on the tax form, including the purposes for which the contribution would be used.
This bill would require money contributed to the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of costs, as provided, and to the Natural Resources Agency for distribution of competitive grants to provide funds or supplement funding of the state, county and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and projects identified as necessary for the restoration and maintenance of the Salton Sea and to develop a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness, as specified.
The bill would provide that these provisions would remain in effect only until January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the first appearance of the fund on the tax return, but would further provide for an earlier repeal if the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount, as defined, for that calendar year, in which case these provisions would be repealed on December 1 of that year.","An act to add and repeal Article 4 (commencing with Section 18735) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to the Salton Sea."

This bill would extend eligibility for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals 19 years of age and older who are otherwise eligible for those benefits but for their immigration status if the department determines that sufficient funding is available, or for limited scope Medi-Cal benefits if funding for full-scope benefits is not available. The bill would require these individuals to enroll into Medi-Cal managed care health plans, and to pay copayments and premium contributions, to the extent required of otherwise eligible Medi-Cal recipients who are similarly situated. The bill would require that benefits for those services to be provided with state-only funds only if federal financial participation is not available. Because counties are required to make Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and this bill would expand Medi-Cal eligibility, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the department to adopt regulations by July 1, 2018, and, commencing July 1, 2016, would require the department to provide a status report to the Legislature on a semiannual basis until regulations have been adopted.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of clinical laboratories and clinical laboratory personnel by the State Department of Public Health and makes a violation of a provision under this law a misdemeanor. Existing law authorizes a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform specified clinical laboratory tests, including pregnancy, glucose level, cholesterol, and occult blood tests. Existing law authorizes a registered clinical laboratory to perform these tests if the test is subject to a certificate of waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and the laboratory has registered with the State Department of Public Health.
Existing law authorizes the results of the test to be provided directly to the person requesting the test if the test is on or for his or her own body. Existing law requires that those test results be provided in a manner that presents clear information and that identifies results indicating the need for referral to a physician.
This bill would repeal those provisions and instead allow a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform, any laboratory test that the laboratory offers to the public on a direct access basis without a healing arts licensee’s order. If a laboratory test is conducted without an order from a healing arts licensee, the bill would require any report of the test results to be provided to the person who was the subject of the test. The bill would require the report to state in bold type that it is the responsibility of the person who was tested to arrange with his or her health care provider for consultation and interpretation of the test results. The bill would make additional conforming changes. By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1288 of, and to repeal and add Section 1246.5 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to clinical laboratories.
An act to add Section 14102.1 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Improving occupational health and safety in all lines of work is a priority for the State of California, and that focus should extend to child care caregivers.
(b) Child care caregivers are at risk for occupational health and safety risks on the job, including from toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards such as lifting and bending. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, child care workers have musculoskeletal injury rates comparable to those of industrial truck and tractor operators and construction equipment operators.
(c) The federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG) (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9857 et. seq) was reauthorized in 2014 (Public Law 113-186). The changes to the CCDBG include a requirement that caregivers complete preservice or orientation training on topics including infectious disease prevention and control, building and physical premises safety, emergency preparedness and disaster response, and handling/storage of hazardous materials and disposal of biocontaminants. Requiring caregivers to complete occupational health and safety training will satisfy several of the new CCDBG health and safety requirements and will also help caregivers with child development permits satisfy the 105 hours of professional growth activities necessary to renew their permits. The training will also improve health and safety for caregivers and the children in their care, and will therefore benefit the families of the children served and the economy of the state.

Section 35179 of the
Education Code
is amended to read:
35179.
(a)Each school district governing board shall have general control of, and be responsible for, all aspects of the interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities in its district, including, but not necessarily limited to, eligibility, season of sport, number of sports, personnel, and sports facilities. In addition, the school district governing board shall ensure that all interscholastic policies, programs, and activities in its district are in compliance with state and federal law.
(b)School district governing boards may enter into associations or consortia with other school district governing boards for the purpose of governing regional or statewide interscholastic athletic programs by permitting the public schools under their jurisdictions to enter into a voluntary association with other schools for the purpose of enacting and enforcing rules relating to eligibility for, and participation in, interscholastic athletic programs among and between schools.
(c)Each school district governing board, or its designee, shall represent the individual schools located within its jurisdiction in any voluntary association of schools formed or maintained pursuant to this section.
(d)No voluntary interscholastic athletic association, of which any public school is a member, shall discriminate against, or deny the benefits of any program to, any person on any basis prohibited by Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 200) of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 1.
(e)Notwithstanding any other law, no voluntary interscholastic athletic association shall deny a school from participating in interscholastic athletic activities because of the religious tenets of the school, irrespective of whether that school is directly controlled by a religious organization.
(f)Interscholastic athletics is defined as those policies, programs, and activities that are formulated or executed in conjunction with, or in contemplation of, athletic contests between two or more schools, either public or private.","Existing federal law, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, which is administered by the State Department of Education in California, requires that a state plan include requirements that specified child care providers receive minimum health and safety training relating to, among other things, the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the handling and storage of hazardous materials in order to receiving funding for child care.
Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, administered by the State Department of Education, requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer child care and development programs that offer a full range of services for eligible children from infancy to 13 years of age, including, among others, resource and referral programs, alternative payment programs, and family child care home education networks.
This bill would, effective July 1, 2017, require a caregiver, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession, and on how to identify and avoid those risks. The bill would require the State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Public Health and child care caregivers, to develop the curriculum for the training, which is required to include, among other things, a discussion of specified risks, including chemical and biological hazards. The bill would also require the department to contract with an entity to provide the occupational health and safety training and to compensate a caregiver for his or her time for attending the training.
Existing law provides that each school district governing board has general control of, and responsibility for, all aspects of the interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities in its district, as specified. Existing law authorizes school district governing boards to enter into associations or consortia with other school district governing boards for the purpose of governing regional or statewide interscholastic athletic programs, as specified. Existing law prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from discriminating against, or denying the benefits of any program to, any person on the basis of specified personal characteristics. Existing law also prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from denying a school from participation in interscholastic athletic activities because of the religious tenets of the school.

Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
799.
(a) With respect to all taxes enacted by any local jurisdiction, including any city, county, or city and county, including a chartered city or county, any district, including an agency of the state, formed pursuant to general law or special act, for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries, or any public or municipal corporation, and imposed on the customers of public utilities or other service suppliers, which taxes have been collected by the public utilities and other service suppliers and remitted to the local jurisdiction all of the following shall apply:
(1) The public utility or other service supplier shall have no duty to independently investigate or inquire with the local jurisdiction concerning the validity of the tax ordinance.
(2) In connection with any actions or claims relating to or arising from the invalidity of the tax ordinance, in whole or in part, the public utility or other service supplier shall not be liable to any customer as a consequence of collecting the tax.
(3) In the event a local jurisdiction is ordered to refund the tax, it shall be the sole responsibility of the local jurisdiction to refund the tax. Unless a public utility or other service supplier is reimbursed by the local jurisdiction for the actual cost of assisting the local jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, calculating or verifying refunds, distributing refunds, providing data, or providing data processing assistance, the public utility or other service supplier shall not be required to assist the local jurisdiction to refund the tax, including, but not limited to, calculating or verifying refunds, distributing refunds, providing data, or providing data processing assistance.
(4) In any action seeking to enjoin collection of taxes imposed on customers of utilities or other service suppliers and collected by the utilities or other service suppliers, in any action seeking declaratory relief concerning the taxes, in any action seeking a refund of the taxes, or in any action seeking otherwise to invalidate the taxes, the sole necessary party defendant in the action shall be the local jurisdiction on whose behalf the taxes are collected and the public utility or other service supplier collecting the taxes shall not be named as a party in the action.
(5) If a local jurisdiction repeals the tax, reduces an existing tax rate, changes the tax base, or makes any other changes to the tax that would affect the collection and remittance of the tax, the local jurisdiction shall submit, on and after the effective date of the enactment of the change, a written notification and supply all requisite information to the public utility or service supplier, in accordance with the procedures established by the public utility or service supplier. The public utility or other service supplier shall not be required to implement the changes any earlier than 60 days from the date on which the public utility or other service provider receives the written notification and all other information required by the public utility or other service supplier. If the 60th day is not the first day of a month, then the public utility or other service provider shall implement the changes on the first day of the month following the month in which the 60th day occurs.
(6) If a local jurisdiction adopts a new tax, the local jurisdiction shall submit, on and after the effective date of the adoption of the new tax, a written notification to the public utility or other service supplier, in accordance with procedures established by the public utility or other service supplier, requesting that the tax be collected. The public utility or other service supplier shall not be required to begin collecting the tax any earlier than 90 days from the date on which the public utility or other service provider receives written notification and all other information required by the public utility or other service supplier. If the 90th day is not the first day of a month, then the public utility or other service provider shall begin the tax collection on the first day of the month following the month in which the 90th day occurs. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the public utility or other service provider from beginning the tax collection at an earlier date.
(b) For purposes of this section, “other service supplier” shall include, but not be limited to, a holder of a state franchise issued pursuant to Section 5840.
(c) The Legislature finds and declares that the limitations imposed by this section constitute an issue of statewide concern. The Legislature further finds and declares that the limitations imposed by this section are not municipal affairs as that term is used in Article XI of the California Constitution. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that the limitations imposed by this section apply to all cities, counties, and cities and counties, including chartered cities and chartered counties, any district, including an agency of the state, formed pursuant to general law or special act, for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries, and any public or municipal corporation.

The amendment of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code made by this act does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law.","Under existing law, a public utility is required to bill its customers for various taxes imposed by a public entity and remit the revenues from those taxes that are collected to the public entity. The Public Utilities Act provides that a public utility or other service supplier is not liable to any customer as a result of collecting these taxes, and grants various rights to, and imposes various requirements on, public utilities and other service suppliers with respect to the imposition, repeal, or collection of the taxes. Existing law, the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006, establishes a procedure for the issuance of state franchises for the provision of video service, defined to include cable service and open-video systems, administered by the Public Utilities Commission.
This bill would explicitly define the term “other service supplier” for the purpose of those provisions to include, but not be limited to, a holder of a state franchise for the provision of video service.","An act to amend Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to public utilities."

54953.
(a) All meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(b) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the legislative body of a local agency may use teleconferencing for the benefit of the public and the legislative body of a local agency in connection with any meeting or proceeding authorized by law. The teleconferenced meeting or proceeding shall comply with all requirements of this chapter and all otherwise applicable provisions of law relating to a specific type of meeting or proceeding.
(2) Teleconferencing, as authorized by this section, may be used for all purposes in connection with any meeting within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body. All votes taken during a teleconferenced meeting shall be by rollcall.
(3) If the legislative body of a local agency elects to use teleconferencing, it shall post agendas at all teleconference locations and conduct teleconference meetings in a manner that protects the statutory and constitutional rights of the parties or the public appearing before the legislative body of a local agency. Each teleconference location shall be identified in the notice and agenda of the meeting or proceeding, and each teleconference location shall be accessible to the public. During the teleconference, at least a quorum of the members of the legislative body shall participate from locations within the boundaries of the territory over which the local agency exercises jurisdiction, except as provided in subdivision (d). The agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to address the legislative body directly pursuant to Section 54954.3 at each teleconference location.
(4) For the purposes of this section, “teleconference” means a meeting of a legislative body, the members of which are in different locations, connected by electronic means, through either audio or video, or both. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a local agency from providing the public with additional teleconference locations.
(c) (1) No legislative body shall take action by secret ballot, whether preliminary or final.
(2) The legislative body of a local agency shall publicly report any action taken and the vote or abstention on that action of each member present for the action.
(3) Prior to taking final action, the legislative body shall orally report a summary of a recommendation for a final action on the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of a local agency executive, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 3511.1, during the open meeting in which the final action is to be taken. This paragraph shall not affect the public’s right under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1) to inspect or copy records created or received in the process of developing the recommendation.
(d) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions relating to a quorum in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), when a health authority conducts a teleconference meeting, members who are outside the jurisdiction of the authority may be counted toward the establishment of a quorum when participating in the teleconference if at least 50 percent of the number of members that would establish a quorum are present within the boundaries of the territory over which the authority exercises jurisdiction, and the health authority provides a teleconference number, and associated access codes, if any, that allows any person to call in to participate in the meeting and that number and access codes are identified in the notice and agenda of the meeting.
(2) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as discouraging health authority members from regularly meeting at a common physical site within the jurisdiction of the authority or from using teleconference locations within or near the jurisdiction of the authority. A teleconference meeting for which a quorum is established pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject to all other requirements of this section.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, a health authority means any entity created pursuant to Sections 14018.7, 14087.31, 14087.35, 14087.36, 14087.38, and 14087.9605 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, any joint powers authority created pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of Chapter 5 of Division 7 for the purpose of contracting pursuant to Section 14087.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and any advisory committee to a county sponsored health plan licensed pursuant to Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code if the advisory committee has 12 or more members.

Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
This act ensures that more Californians can meaningfully participate in the meetings of legislative bodies of local agencies.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.","The Ralph M. Brown Act requires that all meetings of a legislative body of a local agency be open and public, except that closed sessions may be held under prescribed circumstances. Existing law authorizes the legislative body to hold a closed session to consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee, but generally prohibits the closed session from including discussion or action on proposed compensation. Existing law authorizes the legislative body to hold a closed session with the local agency’s designated representatives regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of its represented and unrepresented employees, but prohibits the closed session from including final action on the proposed compensation of one or more unrepresented employees. Existing law prohibits the legislative body from calling a special meeting regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of a local agency executive, as defined.
This bill, prior to taking final action, would require the legislative body to orally report a summary of a recommendation for a final action on the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of a local agency executive during the open meeting in which the final action is to be taken.
By imposing new requirements on cities, counties, cities and counties, and special districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

(c) Every school year, kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, parents across California pay at their own expense to obtain vital educational resources and services that are essential to those children entrusted to their parents’ care.
(d) Financial pressures weighing upon California families have also made it difficult to ensure for their children a quality elementary and secondary education while at the same time generating funds for college.

SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA establishes a procedure by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and a procedure for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings upon the filing of an action or proceeding challenging a lead agency’s action on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA.
The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 (Proposition 1), approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of bonds pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program.
This bill would require a lead agency, in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approvals for certain water storage projects funded, in whole or in part, by Proposition 1, to comply with specified procedures. Because a public agency would be required to comply with those new procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the lead agency to concurrently prepare the record of proceedings for the project. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2017, to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings seeking judicial review of a lead agency’s action in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approval for those projects that require the actions or proceedings, including any appeals therefrom, be resolved, to the extent feasible, within 370 days of the certification of the record of proceedings. The bill would prohibit a court from staying or enjoining those projects unless it makes specified findings.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 21168.6.7 to the Public Resources Code, relating to environmental quality."

The exemption provided by this paragraph shall be shown on the local roll and shall reduce the full value of the corporate property.

SEC. 6.
Notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act.
SEC. 7.
This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, a disabled veteran’s property tax exemption for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran’s spouse, including an unmarried surviving spouse, if the veteran, because of an injury incurred in military service, is blind in both eyes, has lost the use of 2 or more limbs, or is totally disabled, as those terms are defined, or if the veteran has, as a result of a service-connected injury or disease, died while on active duty in military service. That law defines a veteran for its purposes as a person who, among other things, is serving in or has served in and has been discharged under honorable conditions from service in the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.
This bill, for property tax lien dates for the 2017–18 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, would expand that definition of veteran to include a person who has been discharged in other than dishonorable conditions from service under those same conditions and who has been determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to be eligible for federal veterans’ health and medical benefits.
Existing property tax law allows the correction of certain errors resulting in incorrect entries on the property tax roll within 4 years after the making of the assessment.
This bill would extend the time for correcting errors to the roll related to the disabled veterans’ exemption to 8 years.
Existing law requires property taxes to be refunded upon the filing of a claim within 8 years after making the payment sought to be refunded if the claim relates to the disabled veterans’ exemption.
This bill would instead require a refund on a claim filed within 8 years after making the payment sought to be refunded, or within 60 days of the date of a specified notice, whichever is later.
Existing property tax law authorizes any taxes paid before or after delinquency to be refunded by the county tax collector within 4 years after the date of payment under specified conditions.
This bill would authorize any taxes paid before or after delinquency to be refunded by the county tax collector within 8 years after the date of payment if the amount paid exceeds the amount due on the property as a result of corrections to the roll that relate to the disabled veterans’ exemption.
By changing the manner in which local county officials administer property tax refunds with respect to the disabled veterans’ exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","An act to amend Sections 205.5 and 5097 of, and to add Sections 4831.1 and 5097.3 to, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy."

The officer shall state in his or her report the facts upon which that belief and that clear indication are based. The officer shall advise the person that he or she is required to submit to an additional test. The person shall submit to and complete a blood test. If the person arrested is incapable of completing the blood test, the person shall submit to and complete a urine test.

In that case, the officer shall advise the person of those tests that are available at the medical facility and that the person’s choice is limited to those tests that are available.
(4) The officer shall also advise the person that he or she does not have the right to have an attorney present before stating whether he or she will submit to a test or tests, before deciding which test or tests to take, or during administration of the test or tests chosen, and that, in the event of refusal to submit to a test or tests, the refusal may be used against him or her in a court of law.
(5) A person who is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him or her incapable of refusal is deemed not to have withdrawn his or her consent and a test or tests may be administered whether or not the person is told that his or her failure to submit to, or the noncompletion of, the test or tests will result in the suspension or revocation of his or her privilege to operate a motor vehicle. A person who is dead is deemed not to have withdrawn his or her consent and a test or tests may be administered at the direction of a peace officer.
(b) A person who is afflicted with hemophilia is exempt from the blood test required by this section, but shall submit to, and complete, a urine test.
(c) A person who is afflicted with a heart condition and is using an anticoagulant under the direction of a licensed physician and surgeon is exempt from the blood test required by this section, but shall submit to, and complete, a urine test.
(d) (1) A person lawfully arrested for an offense allegedly committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle in violation of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153 may request the arresting officer to have a chemical test made of the arrested person’s blood or breath for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of that person’s blood, and, if so requested, the arresting officer shall have the test performed.
(2) If a blood or breath test is not available under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), or under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), or under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the person shall submit to the remaining test in order to determine the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the person’s blood. If both the blood and breath tests are unavailable, the person shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her urine and shall submit to a urine test.
(e) If the person, who has been arrested for a violation of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153, refuses or fails to complete a chemical test or tests, or requests that a blood or urine test be taken, the peace officer, acting on behalf of the department, shall serve the notice of the order of suspension or revocation of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle personally on the arrested person. The notice shall be on a form provided by the department.
(f) If the peace officer serves the notice of the order of suspension or revocation of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, the peace officer shall take possession of all driver’s licenses issued by this state that are held by the person.

(g) (1) The peace officer shall immediately forward a copy of the completed notice of suspension or revocation form and any driver’s license taken into possession under subdivision (f), with the report required by Section 13380, to the department. If the person submitted to a blood or urine test, the peace officer shall forward the results immediately to the appropriate forensic laboratory. The forensic laboratory shall forward the results of the chemical tests to the department within 15 calendar days of the date of the arrest.
(2) (A) Notwithstanding any other law, a document containing data prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system that is electronically transmitted or retrieved through public or private computer networks to or by the department is the best available evidence of the chemical test results in all administrative proceedings conducted by the department. In addition, any other official record that is maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory, relates to a chemical test analysis prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system, and is electronically transmitted and retrieved through a public or private computer network to or by the department is admissible as evidence in the department’s administrative proceedings.

(B) Notwithstanding any other law, the failure of an employee of the department to certify under subparagraph (A) is not a public offense.
(h) A preliminary alcohol screening test that indicates the presence or concentration of alcohol based on a breath sample in order to establish reasonable cause to believe the person was driving a vehicle in violation of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153 is a field sobriety test and may be used by an officer as a further investigative tool.
(i) A preliminary oral fluid screening test that indicates the presence or concentration of a drug or controlled substance based on a sample in order to establish reasonable cause to believe the person was driving a vehicle in violation of Section
23140, 23152,
23152
or 23153 is a field sobriety test and may be used by an officer as a further investigative tool.
(j) If the officer decides to use a preliminary alcohol or oral fluid screening test, the officer shall advise the person that he or she is requesting that person to take a preliminary alcohol or oral fluid screening test to assist the officer in determining if that person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs. The person’s obligation to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test, as required by this section, for the purpose of determining the alcohol or drug content of that person’s blood, is not satisfied by the person submitting to a preliminary alcohol or oral fluid screening test. The officer shall advise the person of that fact and of the person’s right to refuse to take the preliminary alcohol or oral fluid screening test.","Existing law provides that a person who drives a motor vehicle is deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her blood for the purpose of determining the drug content of his or her blood if lawfully arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Existing law provides that if a blood test is unavailable, the person shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her urine and shall submit to a urine test. Existing law authorizes an officer to use a preliminary alcohol screening test that indicates the presence or concentration of alcohol based on a breath sample as a further investigatory tool in order to establish reasonable cause to believe the person was driving a vehicle in violation of certain prohibitions against driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
This bill would authorize an officer to use a preliminary oral fluid screening test that indicates the presence or concentration of a drug or controlled substance as a further investigatory tool in order to establish reasonable cause to believe the person was driving a vehicle in violation of certain prohibitions against driving under the influence of drugs.","An act to amend Section 23612 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

Existing law establishes the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians, a continuously appropriated account, within the Health Professions Education Fund that is managed by the Health Professions Education Foundation and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, to primarily provide funding for the ongoing operations of the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and imposes certain requirements on health care service plans. Existing law imposes various fines and administrative penalties on health care service plans for certain violations of the act, which are deposited into the Managed Care Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund. Existing law requires the first $1,000,000 in the fund to be transferred each year to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program. Existing law requires all remaining funds to be transferred each year to the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program.
This bill would expand the eligibility for loan repayment funds under the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program to include those physicians providing psychiatric services. The bill would provide that continuously appropriated funds deposited into the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians shall not be made available under the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program to fund the repayment of loans for those physicians providing psychiatric services or those physicians whose primary specialty is psychiatry, as specified.
The bill would instead require, after the first $1,000,000 is transferred from the Managed Care Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians, $1,000,000 to be transferred each year to the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program. The bill would require any amount remaining over the amounts transferred to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians and the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund to be transferred each year to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program, and provide that one-half of these moneys

398,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
254.5.
(a) Claims for the welfare exemption and the veterans’ organization exemption shall be filed on or before February 15 of each year with the assessor.
The assessor may not approve a property tax exemption claim until the claimant has been issued a valid organizational clearance certificate pursuant to Section 254.6. Financial statements shall be submitted only if requested in writing by the assessor.
(b) (1) The assessor shall review all claims for the welfare exemption to ascertain whether the property on which the exemption is claimed meets the requirements of Section 214. The assessor shall also review all claims for the veterans’ organization exemption to ascertain whether the property on which the exemption is claimed meets the requirements of Section 215.1. In this connection, the assessor shall consider, among other matters, whether:
(A) Any capital investment of the owner or operator for expansion of a physical plant is justified by the contemplated return thereon, and required to serve the interests of the community.
(B) The property on which the exemption is claimed is used for the actual operation of an exempt activity and does not exceed an amount of property reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the exempt purpose.
(2) The assessor may institute an audit or verification of the operations of the owner or operator of the applicant’s property to ascertain whether both the owner and operator meet the requirements of Section 214.
(c) (1) The assessor may deny a claim for the welfare exemption on a property, notwithstanding that the claimant has been granted an organizational clearance certificate by the board.
(2) If the assessor finds that the claimant’s property is ineligible for the welfare exemption or the veterans’ organization exemption, the assessor shall notify the claimant in writing of all of the following:
(A) That the property is ineligible for the exemption.
(B) That the claimant may seek a refund of property taxes paid by filing a refund claim with the county.
(C) That if the claimant’s refund claim with the county is denied, the claimant may file a refund action in superior court.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), an applicant, granted a welfare exemption and owning any property exempted pursuant to Section 214.15 or Section 231, shall not be required to reapply for the welfare exemption in any subsequent year in which there has been no transfer of, or other change in title to, the exempted property and the property is used exclusively by a governmental entity or by a nonprofit corporation described in Section 214.15 for its interest and benefit. The applicant shall notify the assessor on or before February 15 if, on or before the preceding lien date, the applicant became ineligible for the welfare exemption or if, on or before that lien date, the property was no longer owned by the applicant or otherwise failed to meet all requirements for the welfare exemption.
Prior to the lien date, the assessor shall annually mail a notice to every applicant relieved of the requirement of filing an annual application by this subdivision.
The notice shall be in a form and contain that information that the board may prescribe, after consultation with the California Assessors’ Association, and shall set forth the circumstances under which the property may no longer be eligible for exemption, and advise the applicant of the duty to inform the assessor if the property is no longer eligible for exemption.
The notice shall inform any applicant desiring to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption under Section 214.15 or Section 231 for the next fiscal year of the procedure to reaffirm exemption eligibility. The failure to reaffirm eligibility for the exemption does not of itself constitute a waiver of exemption as called for by the California Constitution, but may result in additional contact by the assessor to verify exempt activity.

(e) Upon any indication that a welfare exemption or veterans’ organization exemption on the property has been incorrectly granted, the assessor shall redetermine eligibility for the exemption. If the assessor determines that the property, or any portion thereof, is no longer eligible for the exemption, he or she shall immediately cancel the exemption on so much of the property as is no longer eligible for the exemption.
(f) If a welfare exemption or veterans’ organization exemption on the property has been incorrectly allowed, an escape assessment as provided by Article 4 (commencing with Section 531) of Chapter 3 in the amount of the exemption, with interest as provided in Section 506, shall be made, and a penalty shall be assessed for any failure to notify the assessor as required by this section in an amount equaling 10 percent of the escape assessment, but may not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250).
(g) Pursuant to Section 15640 of the Government Code, the board shall review the assessor’s administration of the welfare exemption and the veterans’ organization exemption as part of the board’s survey of the county assessment roll to ensure the proper administration of the exemption.
SEC. 2.
Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
1840.
If any county, city and county, or municipal corporation desires to secure a review, equalization, or adjustment of the assessment of its property by the board pursuant to subdivision (g) of Section 11 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, it shall apply to the board for that review, equalization, or adjustment in writing on or before November 30. If the assessment objected to is one made outside the regular period for those assessments, the application for review shall be filed with the board within 60 days from the date the tax bill is mailed to the assessee.
Every application shall show the facts claimed to require action of the board, and a copy of the application shall be filed with the assessor whose assessment is questioned. Upon receipt of a timely application, the board shall afford the applicant notice and a hearing in accordance with any rules and regulations as the board may prescribe. The failure to file a timely application shall bar the applicant from relief under subdivision (g) of Section 11 of Article XIII or this section.
SEC. 3.
Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
4674.
Any excess in the proceeds deposited in the delinquent tax sale trust fund remaining after satisfaction of the amounts distributed under Sections 4672, 4672.1, 4672.2, 4673, and 4673.1 shall be retained in the fund on account of, and may be claimed by parties of interest in the property as provided in, Section 4675. At the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (e) of Section 4675, any excess proceeds not claimed under Section 4675 may be transferred to the county general fund of the county by the county auditor, except that prior to the transfer, the county may deduct those costs of maintaining the redemption and tax-defaulted property files, and those costs of administering and processing the claims for excess proceeds, that have not been recovered under any other law.","Existing law relieves applicants granted a welfare exemption and owning certain exempt property from reapplying for the welfare exemption in any subsequent year in which there has been no transfer of, or other change in title to, the exempted property and the property is used exclusively by a governmental entity or by a nonprofit corporation, as specified. Existing law requires the assessor to annually mail a notice to every applicant relieved of the requirement of filing an annual application as so described and requires the notice to be in a form and contain that information that the State Board of Equalization may prescribe. Existing law also requires the notice to include a card that is to be returned to the assessor by an applicant desiring to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption.
This bill would instead require the State Board of Equalization to prescribe the form and content of the notice after consultation with the California Assessors’ Association. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the notice include a card and would instead require the notice to inform any applicant desiring to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption for the next fiscal year of the procedure to reaffirm exemption eligibility.
The California Constitution generally exempts real property that is owned by a local government from property taxation, but provides that real property owned by a local government that is located outside its boundaries is taxable if it was taxable when acquired. Existing law authorizes a county, city and county, or municipal corporation that owns taxable property to apply to the State Board of Equalization for a review, equalization, or adjustment of a property tax assessment relating to this publicly owned property. Existing law requires that this application be submitted to the board on or before the later of either July 20 or within 2 weeks of the date upon which a county assessor delivers the local roll containing that assessment to the county auditor.
This bill would instead require that this application be submitted to the board on or before November 30.
Existing law generally authorizes a county tax collector to sell tax-defaulted property 5 years or more, or 3 years or more, as applicable, after that property has become tax defaulted. Existing law requires the proceeds from the sale of tax-defaulted property to be deposited in the delinquent tax sale trust fund and requires the proceeds in the fund to be distributed in a specified manner. Existing law requires any excess proceeds remaining in the delinquent tax sale trust fund after distribution of the proceeds to be retained in the fund subject to being claimed by parties of interest, as provided. Existing law, at the expiration of a specified time period, authorizes any excess proceeds not claimed to be transferred to the county general fund.
This bill would authorize the county to deduct certain costs prior to transferring any excess proceeds not claimed to the county general fund.","An act to amend Sections 254.5, 1840, and 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."
399,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 42010 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
42010.
(a) (1) On and after January 1, 2016, a prepaid MTS surcharge shall be imposed on each prepaid consumer and shall be collected by a seller from each prepaid consumer at the time of each retail transaction in this state. The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be imposed as a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in this state.
(2) The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be in lieu of any charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act (Part 20 (commencing with Section 41001)) and the Public Utilities Commission surcharges for prepaid mobile telephony services.
(b) The prepaid MTS surcharge shall be annually calculated by the board by no later than November 1 of each year commencing November 1, 2015, by adding the following:
(1) The surcharge rate reported pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 41030.
(2) The Public Utilities Commission’s reimbursement fee and telecommunications universal service surcharges, established by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 319 of the Public Utilities Code.
(c) (1) The board shall post, for each local jurisdiction, the combined total of the rates of prepaid MTS surcharge and the rate or rates of local charges, as calculated pursuant to Sections 42102 and 42102.5, that each local jurisdiction has adopted, not later than December 1 of each year, on its Internet Web site. The posted combined rate shall be the rate that applies to all retail transactions during the calendar year beginning April 1 following the posting.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if a local agency notifies the board pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 42101.5 that the posted rate is inaccurate or it no longer imposes a local charge or local charges or that the rate of its local charge or local charges has decreased, the board shall promptly post a recalculated rate that is applicable to the jurisdiction of that local agency. The change shall become operative on the first day of the calendar quarter commencing more than 60 days from the date the local agency notifies the board of the inaccuracy or that it no longer imposes a local charge or that the rate of its local charge has decreased. Nothing in this section modifies the notice obligations of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code. However, beginning January 1, 2016, the notification and implementation requirements of paragraphs (5) and (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code shall not apply to prepaid mobile telephony services.
(3) The board shall also separately post on its Internet Web site the individual rates for each of the following:
(A) Each of the Public Utilities Commission surcharges that make up the Public Utilities Commission surcharge portion of the prepaid MTS surcharge, as reported pursuant to Section 319 of the Public Utilities Code.
(B) The rate for the emergency telephone users surcharge reported pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 41030.
(C) Each of the individual local charges reported pursuant to Section 42101.5.
(4) A seller collecting the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges pursuant to this part and Part 21.1 (commencing with Section 42100) may rely upon the accuracy of the information posted on the board’s Internet Web site in collecting and remitting all amounts of the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges.
(d) (1) Except for amounts retained pursuant to subdivision (e), and except as provided in subdivision (f) for a seller that is a direct seller, all amounts of the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges collected by sellers shall be remitted to the board pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 42020).
(2) A seller that is authorized to provide lifeline service under the state lifeline program or federal lifeline program, that sells prepaid mobile telephony services directly to the prepaid customer, shall remit the prepaid MTS surcharge to the board, less any applicable exemption from the surcharge that is applicable to the retail transaction pursuant to Section 42012.
(e) A seller that is not a direct seller shall be permitted to deduct and retain an amount equal to 2 percent of the amounts that are collected by the seller from prepaid consumers for the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges, on a pro rata basis, according to that portion of the revenues collected by the seller for each of the following:
(1) The emergency telephone users surcharge.
(2) The Public Utilities Commission surcharges.
(3) Local charges.
(f) A direct seller shall remit the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges as follows:
(1) That portion of the prepaid MTS surcharge that consists of the Public Utilities Commission surcharges shall be remitted to the commission with those reports required by the commission. The amounts remitted to the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into the respective universal service funds created pursuant to Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 270) of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code and to the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement Account described in Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 401) of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code.
(2) That portion of the prepaid MTS surcharge that consists of the emergency telephone users surcharge shall be remitted to the board pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act (Part 20 (commencing with Section 41001)) for those retail transactions with a prepaid consumer in the state, with a return filed with the board using electronic media. The amount remitted to the board pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into the State Emergency Telephone Number Account in the General Fund.
(3) Local charges, if applicable, shall be remitted to the local jurisdiction or local agency imposing the local charge. Remittance of the local charges shall be separately identified from any other local taxes or other charges that are remitted to the local jurisdiction or local entity imposing the local tax or other charge. The amounts remitted to the local jurisdiction or local agency imposing the local charge pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into the respective local jurisdiction or local agency account.
(g) A direct seller shall utilize the amounts posted by the board pursuant to subdivision (c) when determining what amounts to remit to the Public Utilities Commission, the board, and each local jurisdiction or local agency.
(h) A prepaid MTS provider shall offer prepaid consumers the option to make payment for additional prepaid usage directly to the prepaid MTS provider at the provider’s retail location or Internet Web site.
(i) The amount of the combined prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges shall be separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by the seller, or otherwise disclosed electronically to the prepaid consumer, at the time of the retail transaction.
(j) The prepaid MTS surcharge that is required to be collected by a seller and any amount unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that is not owed as part of the surcharge, but was collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that it was owed as part of the surcharge, constitute debts owed by the seller to this state. The local charge that is required to be collected by a seller and any amounts unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that are not owed as part of the local charge, but that were collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that they were owed as part of the local charge, constitute debts owed by the seller jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing that local charge.
(k) A seller that has collected any amount of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges in excess of the amount of the surcharge imposed by this part and actually due from a prepaid consumer may refund that amount to the prepaid consumer, even though the surcharge amount has already been paid over to the board and no corresponding credit or refund has yet been secured. Any seller making a refund of any charge to a prepaid consumer may repay therewith the amount of the surcharge paid.
(l) (1) Every prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services in this state is liable for the prepaid MTS surcharge and any local charges until they have been paid to this state, except that payment to a seller registered under this part relieves the prepaid consumer from further liability for the surcharge and local charges. Any surcharge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed to the state by the person required to collect and remit the surcharge. Any local charge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing the local charge by the person required to collect and remit the local charge. Nothing in this part shall impose any obligation upon a seller to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the surcharge or local charge imposed by this section.
(2) A credit shall be allowed against, but shall not exceed, the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges imposed on any prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by this part to the extent that the prepaid consumer has paid emergency telephone users charges, state utility regulatory commission fees, state universal service charges, or local charges on the purchase to any other state, political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. The credit shall be apportioned to the charges against which it is allowed in proportion to the amounts of those charges.
(m) (1) A seller is relieved from liability to collect the prepaid MTS surcharge imposed by this part that became due and payable, insofar as the base upon which the surcharge is imposed is represented by accounts that have been found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes by the seller or, if the seller is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A seller that has previously paid the surcharge may, under rules and regulations prescribed by the board, take as a deduction on its return the amount found worthless and charged off by the seller. If any such accounts are thereafter in whole or in part collected by the seller, the amount so collected shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the surcharge shall be paid with the return.
(2) The board may by regulation promulgate such other rules with respect to uncollected or worthless accounts as it shall deem necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.

Section 42014 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
42014.
(a) For purposes of this part, a retail transaction occurs in the state under any of the following circumstances:
(1) The prepaid consumer makes the retail transaction in person at a business location in the state (point-of-sale transaction).
(2) If paragraph (1) is not applicable, the prepaid consumer’s address is in the state (known-address transaction). A known-address transaction occurs in the state under any of the following circumstances:
(A) The retail sale involves shipping of an item to be delivered to, or picked up by, the prepaid consumer at a location in the state.
(B) If the prepaid consumer’s address is known by the seller to be in the state, including if the seller’s records maintained in the ordinary course of business indicate that the prepaid consumer’s address is in the state and the records are not made or kept in bad faith.
(C) The prepaid consumer provides an address during consummation of the retail transaction that is in the state, including an address provided with respect to the payment instrument if no other address is available and the address is not given in bad faith.
(3) If an address is not available to the seller to determine whether any of the circumstances in paragraph (2) exist, the transaction will be deemed to be a known-address transaction occurring in this state if the mobile telephone number is associated with a location in this state.
(b) (1) A retail transaction shall occur at only one location for purposes of determining local charges. If the retail transaction is a point-of-sale transaction, the consumption of, use of, or access to, the prepaid mobile telephony service shall be presumed to be at that location.
(2) If the retail transaction is a known-address transaction, the location shall be as determined in descending order beginning with subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a); if subparagraph (A) of that paragraph is inapplicable, then pursuant to subparagraph (B) of that paragraph; if both subparagraphs (A) and (B) of that paragraph are inapplicable, then subparagraph (C) of that paragraph; and if subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of that paragraph are inapplicable, then paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). In a known-address transaction, the consumption of, use of, or access to, the prepaid mobile telephony service shall be presumed to be at the known address.
(c) (1) A seller that relies in good faith on information provided by the board to match the location of a point-of-sale transaction to the applicable prepaid MTS surcharge amount and local charges, that collects that amount from the prepaid consumer, and that remits the amount to the board in compliance with this part, shall not be liable for any additional MTS surcharge or local charges and shall not be required to refund any amounts collected and paid to the board to the prepaid consumer.
(2) For a known-address transaction, the seller may collect the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges that correspond to the five-digit postal ZIP Code of the prepaid consumer’s address. A seller that, with due diligence and in good faith, relies on credible information to match the five-digit postal ZIP Code of the prepaid consumer’s address to the applicable prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges amount, that collects that amount from the prepaid consumer, and that remits the amount to the board in compliance with this part, shall not be liable for any additional MTS surcharge or local charges and shall not be required to refund any amounts collected and paid to the board to the prepaid consumer, even if the five-digit postal ZIP Code of the prepaid consumer’s address that the seller uses corresponds to more than one local charge.
SEC. 3.
Section 42022 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
42022.
Every seller, except a seller that is not required to collect the prepaid MTS surcharge pursuant to Section 42010.7 and local charges pursuant to Section 42101.7, shall register with the board. Nothing in this section prevents a seller from registering with the board on a voluntary basis to collect and remit the surcharge even if the seller meets the de minimis sales threshold provided by Sections 42010.7 and 42101.7. The board shall establish a method for registration of sellers under this part that utilizes the existing registration process for a seller’s permit established pursuant to Section 6066 of the Sales and Use Tax Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001)). Every application for registration shall be made upon a form prescribed by the board and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of its place or places of business, and such other information as the board may require. An application for registration shall be authenticated in a form or pursuant to methods as may be prescribed by the board.","The Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Surcharge Collection Act establishes a prepaid MTS surcharge, as defined, based upon a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in this state for prepaid mobile telephony services, as defined, that is imposed in lieu of any charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act and specified Public Utility Commission surcharges. The act requires, on and after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2020, the prepaid MTS surcharge imposed by that act on a prepaid consumer to be collected by a seller, as defined, from each prepaid consumer at the time of each retail transaction that occurs in this state. The act specifies the circumstances for determining when a transaction occurs in the state.
This bill would make correct an erroneous cross-reference and make minor revisions in the requirements relative to imposition of the prepaid MTS surcharge and the circumstances for determining when a transaction occurs in the state.
The act requires every seller to register with the State Board of Equalization. The act, commencing January 1, 2017, exempts a seller, other than a direct seller, with de minimis sales of prepaid mobile telephony services of less than $15,000 during the previous calendar year from collecting the prepaid MTS surcharge, and requires the Department of Finance to annually review and adjust that de minimis sales threshold, as provided.
This bill would exempt from the registration requirement those sellers with de minimis sales of prepaid mobile telephony services, but would not prevent those sellers from registering with the board on a voluntary basis to collect and remit the surcharge.","An act to amend Sections 42010, 42014, and 42022 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to telecommunications."
