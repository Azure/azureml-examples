400,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Isla Vista community encompasses a population of approximately 15,000 residents situated within approximately a half square mile of land in Santa Barbara County. It is adjacent to the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and its student population, of which approximately 8,000 students reside in university owned housing. Including university property, the area totals about 1,200 acres. Isla Vista represents one of the largest urban communities in California not governed as a city.
(b) Isla Vista faces various challenges in local governance. As a university community, Isla Vista must accommodate the service needs associated with its transient student population and a predominantly renter-oriented community while balancing the needs of local homeowners and long-term residents. Isla Vista’s situation is complicated by its unincorporated status, which limits its local participation in managing public services and providing needed public improvements.
(c) As an unincorporated area, various county agencies provide services to the residents and businesses of Isla Vista. Since these agencies must provide services throughout the whole county, Isla Vista must compete for attention and funding for the services they need. Isla Vista is represented at the county level by one of five supervisors and is situated in the largest and most diverse geographic supervisorial district in the county.
(d) The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District is the only local district providing limited services exclusively to Isla Vista. Due to its stewardship of protected wetlands and the coastline, as well as the dwindling amount of available open space, the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District should remain an independent district.
(e) There have been multiple attempts at achieving cityhood for Isla Vista; however, cityhood has been denied for a variety of reasons, including financial and political feasibility. In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury found that establishing a community services district would be the best governance option to expand and improve services to Isla Vista; however, no action was taken by the community at that time.
(f) Over the last year, the Isla Vista community has been faced with many challenges due to tragic events, including multiple injuries from students falling off cliffs, multiple violent sexual assaults, riots, a mass murder, and homicides that have brought focus to the unique needs of Isla Vista that can only be addressed by direct, local governance. Following these events, a local coalition was formed to determine the best direction for Isla Vista self-governance and the community services district has garnered much local support.
(g) Additionally, following these events, many trustees on the UC Santa Barbara Foundation Board expressed a strong desire to support the chancellor and the university in efforts to create change in Isla Vista, to ensure a safer and more enhanced community for students. The UC Santa Barbara Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies was formed to analyze the conditions and dynamics of Isla Vista and develop mid- and long-term recommendations to establish a viable, safe, and supportive environment. Among their recommendations is that the State of California create a Community Services District/Municipal Improvement District in Isla Vista with potential powers of infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security, and roads.

SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique community needs in the Isla Vista area that would be served by the Isla Vista Community Services District.
SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","The Community Services District Law authorizes the establishment of community services districts and specifies the powers of those districts including, among others, the power to acquire, construct, improve, maintain, and operate community facilities, as specified. Existing law authorizes the formation of the Isla Vista College Community Services District within the unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County known as Isla Vista for the performance of various services, including, but not limited, to public parks, police protection, and transportation facilities.
This bill would authorize the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District by requiring the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara to submit a resolution of application to the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission, and, upon direction by the commission, place the questions of whether the district should be established and whether a utility user tax should be imposed on the ballot at the next countywide election following the completion of the review by the commission. By imposing new duties on the County of Santa Barbara, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would provide that if a utility user tax is not passed by the voters of the district on or before January 1, 2023, the district would be dissolved. The bill would set forth the board of directors of the district and would specify the services that district would be authorized to provide, including, among others, the power to create a tenant mediation program and to exercise the powers of a parking district.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Isla Vista Community Services District.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Part 4 (commencing with Section 61250) to Division 3 of Title 6 of the Government Code, relating to local government."

SEC. 9.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 10.
The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","(1) The Political Reform Act of 1974 prohibits a public official at any level of state or local government from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence a governmental decision in which the public official knows or has reason to know that he or she has a financial interest. A public official has a financial interest in a governmental decision if it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the public generally, on a business entity in which the public official has a direct or indirect investment worth $2,000 or more, real property in which the public official has a direct or indirect interest worth $2,000 or more, and sources of income aggregating $500 or more in value within 12 months before the time when the decision is made.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 requires persons holding specified public offices to file disclosures of investments, real property interests, and income within specified periods of assuming or leaving office, and annually while holding the office. The act requires the disclosures to include a statement indicating, within a specified value range, the fair market value of investments or interests in real property and the aggregate value of income received from a source.
This bill would increase the thresholds at which a public official has a disqualifying financial interest in sources of income from $500 to $1,000, in investments in business entities from $2,000 to $5,000, and in interests in real property from $2,000 to $10,000.
This bill would make conforming adjustments to the thresholds at which income, investments, and interests in real property must be disclosed on a public official’s statement of economic interests. The bill would also revise the dollar amounts associated with the value ranges for reporting the value of economic interests.
This bill would require certain public officials to disclose information on the official’s statement of economic interests relating to governmental decisions for which the public official had a disqualifying financial interest, as specified.
Existing law makes a knowing or willful violation of the act a misdemeanor and subjects offenders to criminal penalties.
By creating additional crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 87207 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 21, that would become operative only if SB 21 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
(3)  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4)  The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","An act to amend Sections 82033, 82034, 87103, 87206, and 87207 of, and to add Sections 87206.5 and 87211 to, the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."
402,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Nearly every worker in
the State of
California will at some time during the year need some time off from work to take care of his or her own health or the health of family members.
(b) Many workers in California do not have any paid sick days, or have an inadequate number of paid sick days, to care for their own health or the health of family members.
(c) Providers of in-home supportive services under Section 14132.95, 14132.952, or 14132.956 of, or Article 7 (commencing with Section 12300) of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of Division 9 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, do not qualify for the mandatory paid sick leave benefit that had been provided under Assembly Bill 1522, the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014.
(d) Providing workers time off to attend to their own health care and the health care of family members will ensure a healthier and more productive workforce in California.
(e) Paid sick days will have an enormously positive impact on the public health of Californians by allowing sick workers paid time off to care for themselves when ill, thus lessening their recovery time, reducing the likelihood of spreading illness to other members of the workforce, and increasing the likelihood that they seek care from a primary health care provider instead of costly emergency room services.
(f) Paid sick days will allow parents to provide personal care for their sick children. Parental care ensures children’s speedy recovery, prevents more serious illnesses, and improves children’s overall mental and physical health.
(g) Providing paid sick days is affordable for employers.
(h) Employers who provide paid sick days enjoy greater employee retention and reduce the likelihood of employees coming to work sick. Studies have shown that costs of decreased productivity caused by sick workers exceed the costs of employee absenteeism.
(i) Workers whose jobs involve significant contact with the public, such as providers of in-home support services, are very unlikely to have paid sick days. Often, these workers have no choice but to come to work when they are ill, thereby spreading illness to coworkers and customers.
(j) Domestic violence and sexual assault affect many persons without regard to age, race, national origin, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.
(k) Domestic violence is a crime that has a devastating effect on families, communities, and the workplace. It impacts productivity, effectiveness, absenteeism, and employee turnover in the workplace. The National Crime Survey estimates that 175,000 days of work each year are missed due to domestic violence.
(l) Survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault may be vulnerable at work when trying to end an abusive relationship because the workplace may be the only place where the perpetrator knows to contact the victim. Studies show that up to one-half of domestic violence victims experience job loss. Forty percent reported on-the-job harassment. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.
(m) Affording survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault paid sick days is vital to their independence and recovery.
SEC. 2.
In enacting this act, it is the intent of the Legislature to do the following:
(a) Ensure that workers in California can address their own health needs and the health needs of their families by requiring employers to provide a minimum level of paid sick days including time for family care.
(b) Decrease public and private health care costs in California by enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for themselves and their family members and to address domestic violence or sexual assault.
(c) Protect employees in California from losing their jobs while they use sick days to care for themselves or their families.
(d) Provide economic security to employees in California who take time off from work for reasons related to domestic violence or sexual assault.
(e) Safeguard the welfare, health, safety, and prosperity of the people of and visitors to California.
(f) Extend equal protection of paid sick leave benefits to providers of in-home supportive services.

SECTION 1.
Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 11366) is added to Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
CHAPTER  3.6. Regulatory Reform
Article  1. Findings and Declarations
11366.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340), Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 11370), Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400), and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500)) requires agencies and the Office of Administrative Law to review regulations to ensure their consistency with law and to consider impacts on the state’s economy and businesses, including small businesses.
(b) However, the act does not require agencies to individually review their regulations to identify overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations that may exist.
(c) At a time when the state’s economy is slowly recovering, unemployment and underemployment continue to affect all Californians, especially older workers and younger workers who received college degrees in the last seven years but are still awaiting their first great job, and with state government improving but in need of continued fiscal discipline, it is important that state agencies systematically undertake to identify, publicly review, and eliminate overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations, both to ensure they more efficiently implement and enforce laws and to reduce unnecessary and outdated rules and regulations.
Article  2. Definitions
11366.1.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “State agency” means a state agency, as defined in Section 11000, except those state agencies or activities described in Section 11340.9.
(b) “Regulation” has the same meaning as provided in Section 11342.600.
Article  3. State Agency Duties
11366.2.
On or before January 1, 2018, each state agency shall do all of the following:
(a) Review all provisions of the California Code of Regulations
applicable to, or adopted by,
adopted by
that state agency.
(b) Identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date.
(c) Adopt, amend, or repeal regulations to reconcile or eliminate any duplication, overlap, inconsistencies, or out-of-date provisions, and shall comply with the process specified in Article 5 (commencing with Section 11346) of Chapter 3.5, unless the addition, revision, or deletion is without regulatory effect and may be done pursuant to Section 100 of Title 1 of the California Code of Regulations.
(d) Hold at least one noticed public hearing,
that
which
shall be noticed on the Internet Web site of the state agency, for the purposes of accepting public comment on proposed revisions to its regulations.
(e) Notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of each house of the Legislature of the revisions to regulations that the state agency proposes to make at least 30 days prior to initiating the process under Article 5 (commencing with Section 11346) of Chapter 3.5 or Section 100 of Title 1 of the California Code of Regulations.
(g) (1) Report to the Governor and the Legislature on the state agency’s compliance with this chapter, including the number and content of regulations the state agency identifies as duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date, and the state agency’s actions to address those regulations.
(2) The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
11366.3.
(a) On or before January 1, 2018, each agency listed in Section 12800 shall notify a department, board, or other unit within that agency of any existing regulations adopted by that department, board, or other unit that the agency has determined may be duplicative, overlapping, or inconsistent with a regulation adopted by another department, board, or other unit within that agency.

11366.4.
An agency listed in Section 12800 shall notify a state agency of any existing regulations adopted by that agency that may duplicate, overlap, or be inconsistent with the state agency’s regulations.
11366.45.
This chapter shall not be construed to weaken or undermine in any manner any human health, public or worker rights, public welfare, environmental, or other protection established under statute. This chapter shall not be construed to affect the authority or requirement for an agency to adopt regulations as provided by statute. Rather, it is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that state agencies focus more efficiently and directly on their duties as prescribed by law so as to use scarce public dollars more efficiently to implement the law, while achieving equal or improved economic and public benefits.
Article  4. Chapter Repeal
11366.5.
This chapter shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2019, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law authorizes various state entities to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations for various specified purposes.

The same rate shall be uniformly charged nonresident students attending any terms or sessions maintained by the community college. The rate charged shall be the rate established for the fiscal year in which the term or session ends.
(g) Any loss in district revenue generated by the nonresident tuition fee shall not be offset by additional state funding.

(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

Section 52.5 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
52.5.
(a) A victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, may bring a civil action for actual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, any combination of those, or any other appropriate relief. A prevailing plaintiff may also be awarded attorney’s fees and costs.
(b) In addition to the remedies specified in this section, in an action under subdivision (a), the plaintiff may be awarded up to three times his or her actual damages or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever is greater. In addition, punitive damages may also be awarded upon proof of the defendant’s malice, oppression, fraud, or duress in committing the act of human trafficking.
(c) An action brought pursuant to this section shall be commenced within seven years of the date on which the trafficking victim was freed from the trafficking situation or, if the victim was a minor when the act of human trafficking against the victim occurred, within 10 years after the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority.
(d) If a person entitled to sue is under a disability at the time the cause of action accrues so that it is impossible or impracticable for him or her to bring an action, the time of the disability is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action. Disability will toll the running of the statute of limitations for this action.
(1) Disability includes being a minor, lacking legal capacity to make decisions, imprisonment, or other incapacity or incompetence.
(2) The statute of limitations shall not run against a plaintiff who is a minor or who lacks the legal competence to make decisions simply because a guardian ad litem has been appointed. A guardian ad litem’s failure to bring a plaintiff’s action within the applicable limitation period will not prejudice the plaintiff’s right to do so after his or her disability ceases.
(3) A defendant is estopped from asserting a defense of the statute of limitations when the expiration of the statute is due to conduct by the defendant inducing the plaintiff to delay the filing of the action, or due to threats made by the defendant causing duress upon the plaintiff.
(4) The suspension of the statute of limitations due to disability, lack of knowledge, or estoppel applies to all other related claims arising out of the trafficking situation.
(5) The running of the statute of limitations is postponed during the pendency of criminal proceedings against the victim.
(e) The running of the statute of limitations may be suspended if a person entitled to sue could not have reasonably discovered the cause of action due to circumstances resulting from the trafficking situation, such as psychological trauma, cultural and linguistic isolation, and the inability to access services.
(f) A prevailing plaintiff may also be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and litigation costs including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and expenses as part of the costs.
(g) Restitution paid by the defendant to the victim shall be credited against a judgment, award, or settlement obtained pursuant to an action under this section. A judgment, award, or settlement obtained pursuant to an action under this section shall be subject to Section 13963 of the Government Code.
(h) A civil action filed under this section shall be stayed during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim. As used in this section, a “criminal action” includes investigation and prosecution, and is pending until a final adjudication in the trial court or dismissal.

11362.777.
(a) The Department of Food and Agriculture shall establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program to be administered by the secretary and, except as specified in subdivision (c), shall administer this section as it pertains to the cultivation of medical marijuana. For purposes of this section and Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 19300) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, medical cannabis is an agricultural product.
(b) (1) A person or entity shall not cultivate medical marijuana without first obtaining both of the following:

(3) A person or entity shall not submit an application for a state pursuant to this section shall notify the department in a manner prescribed by the secretary.
(3) A city, county, or city and county’s locally issued conditional permit requirements must be at least as stringent as the department’s state licensing requirements.
(d) (1) The secretary may prescribe, adopt, and enforce regulations relating to the implementation, administration, and enforcement of this part, including, but not limited to, applicant requirements, collections, reporting, refunds, and appeals.
(2) The secretary may prescribe, adopt, and enforce any emergency regulations as necessary to implement this part. Any emergency regulation prescribed, adopted, or enforced pursuant to this section shall be adopted in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and, for purposes of that chapter, including Section 11349.6 of the Government Code, the adoption of the regulation is an emergency and shall be considered by the Office of Administrative Law as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, and general welfare.
(3) The secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement with a county agricultural commissioner to carry out the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, administration, investigations, inspections, licensing and assistance pertaining to the cultivation of medical marijuana. Compensation under the cooperative agreement shall be paid from assessments and fees collected and deposited pursuant to this chapter and shall provide reimbursement to the county agricultural commissioner for associated costs.
(e) (1) The department, in consultation with, but not limited to, the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall implement a unique identification program for medical marijuana. In implementing the program, the department shall consider issues, including, but not limited to, water use and environmental impacts. In implementing the program, the department shall ensure that:
(A) Individual and cumulative effects of water diversion and discharge associated with cultivation do not affect the instream flows needed for fish spawning, migration, and rearing, and the flows needed to maintain natural flow variability.
(B) Cultivation will not negatively impact springs, riparian wetlands, and aquatic habitats.
(2) The department shall establish a program for the identification of permitted medical marijuana plants at a cultivation site during the cultivation period. The unique identifier shall be attached at the base of each plant. A unique identifier, such as, but not limited to, a zip tie, shall be issued for each medical marijuana plant.

For purposes of this section, the area used to cultivate marijuana shall be measured by the aggregate area of vegetative growth of live marijuana plants on the premises. Exemption from the requirements of this section does not limit or prevent a city, county, or city and county from exercising its police authority under Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution.
SEC. 2.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
To allow local governments to protect the health of their citizens by regulating marijuana at the earliest possible date, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law, enacted by the Legislature, provides for the licensing and regulation by both state and local entities of medical marijuana and its cultivation. Existing law provides that if a city, county, or city and county does not have land use regulations or ordinances regulating or prohibiting the cultivation of marijuana, commencing March 1, 2016, the Department of Food and Agriculture is the sole licensing authority for medical marijuana cultivation applicants in that city, county, or city and county.
This bill would delete the provision that grants the department the sole licensing authority under those circumstances.
Existing law exempts certain persons cultivating medical marijuana from the requirement to obtain both a state license from the Department of Food and Agriculture and a license, permit, or other entitlement allowing cultivation from the city, county, or city and county in which the cultivation will occur. Existing law authorizes a city, county, or city and county to regulate or ban the cultivation, storage, manufacture, transport, provision, or other activity by a person otherwise exempt from state regulation, or to enforce that regulation or ban.
This bill would instead provide that an exemption from these licensure requirements does not limit or prevent a city, county, or city and county from exercising its police power authority under a specified provision of the California Constitution.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 11362.777 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to medical marijuana, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

Existing law requires, as a condition to obtaining a certificate or permit, that the applicant, among other things, participate in a program to regularly check the driving records of all vehicle operators and provide a mandatory controlled substance and alcohol testing certification program. A violation of the act is generally a misdemeanor. Existing law defines a transportation network company as an organization, whether a corporation, partnership, sole proprietor, or other form, operating in California that provides prearranged transportation services for compensation using an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.

Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

(E) An otherwise qualifying institution for which no three-year cohort default rate or graduation rate has been reported by the United States Department of Education shall be provisionally eligible to participate in the Cal Grant Program until a three-year cohort default rate or graduation rate has been reported for the institution by the United States Department of Education.

(ii) Notify renewal Cal Grant recipients attending an institution that is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards at the institution under subparagraph (C) or (F) that the student’s Cal Grant award will be reduced by 20 percent, or eliminated, as appropriate, if the student attends the ineligible institution in an academic year in which the institution is ineligible.
(iii) Provide initial and renewal Cal Grant recipients seeking to attend, or attending, an institution that is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards at the institution under subparagraph (C) or (F) with a complete list of all California postsecondary educational institutions at which the student would be eligible to receive an unreduced Cal Grant award.
(iv) (I)   Establish an appeal process for an otherwise qualifying institution that fails to satisfy the three-year cohort default rate and graduation rate requirements in subparagraphs (C) and (F), respectively.

(m) “Satisfactory academic progress” means those criteria required by applicable federal standards published in Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The commission may adopt regulations defining “satisfactory academic progress” in a manner that is consistent with those federal standards.","The Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.
Existing law requires the commission to certify by November 1 of each year a qualifying institution’s latest 3-year cohort default rate and graduation rate as most recently reported by the United States Department of Education. Existing law provides that an otherwise qualifying institution with a 3-year cohort default rate that is equal to or greater than 15.5% is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards at the institution. Existing law provides that an otherwise qualifying institution is ineligible for an initial or renewal Cal Grant award at the institution if the institution has a graduation rate of 30% or less for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements, as specified, with certain exceptions.
This bill would require the commission to establish an appeal process for an otherwise qualifying institution that fails to satisfy the 3-year cohort default rate and graduation rate requirements and would authorize the commission to grant the appeal for an academic year only if the commission makes a specified determination.","An act to amend Section 69432.7 of the Education Code, relating to financial aid."

(g) Any computer, computer system, computer network, or any software or data, owned by the defendant, that is used during the commission of any public offense described in subdivision (c) or any computer, owned by the defendant, which is used as a repository for the storage of software or data illegally obtained in violation of subdivision (c) shall be subject to forfeiture, as specified in Section 502.01.
(h) (1) Subdivision (c) does not apply to punish any acts which are committed by a person within the scope of his or her lawful employment. For purposes of this section, a person acts within the scope of his or her employment when he or she performs acts which are reasonably necessary to the performance of his or her work assignment.
(2) Paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) does not apply to penalize any acts committed by a person acting outside of his or her lawful employment, provided that the employee’s activities do not cause an injury, to the employer or another, or provided that the value of supplies or computer services which are used does not exceed an accumulated total of two hundred fifty dollars ($250).

(1) The court shall consider prohibitions on access to and use of computers.
(2) Except as otherwise required by law, the court shall consider alternate sentencing, including community service, if the defendant shows remorse and recognition of the wrongdoing, and an inclination not to repeat the offense.","Existing law establishes various crimes relating to computer services and systems, including to knowingly and without permission disrupt or cause the disruption of computer services including government computer services or public safety infrastructure computer system computer services, add, alter, damage, delete, or destroy any computer data, software, or program, introduce a computer contaminant, use the Internet domain name or profile of another. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions punishable by specified fines or terms of imprisonment, or by both those fines and imprisonment.
This bill would clarify the criminal penalties for specified computer crimes by making a person who violates those provisions guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years and a fine not exceeding $10,000, or a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment.","An act to amend Section 502 of the Penal Code, relating to computer crimes."

SECTION 1.
Section 54141 of the Government Code is amended to read:
54141.
As used in this article:
(a) “Local agency” means county, city, whether general law or chartered, city and county, town, school district, municipal corporation, district, political subdivision, or any board, commission, or agency thereof, or other local public agency.
(b) “United States” includes any department, board, or agency thereof.
(c) “State” includes any department or agency thereof.
(d) “Legislative body” means a legislative body as defined in Section 54952.
(e) (1) “Surplus military equipment” means equipment made available to a local agency pursuant to Section 2576a of Title 10 of the United States Code.
(2) “Tactical surplus military equipment” means surplus military equipment identified on the list developed and maintained by the state coordinator pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 54145.
(f) “State coordinator” means the state agency that has signed a current memorandum of agreement with the federal Defense Logistics Agency for the purpose of administering a state program for acquiring surplus military equipment.
SEC. 2.
Section 54145 is added to the Government Code, to read:
54145.
(a) A local agency, other than a local law enforcement agency that is directly under the control of an elected officer, shall not apply to receive tactical surplus military equipment unless the legislative body of the local agency approves the acquisition of tactical surplus military equipment by ordinance or resolution, pursuant to subdivision (b), at a regular meeting held pursuant to the Ralph M. Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950)).
(b) The legislative body of a local agency may adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing the local law enforcement agency in that jurisdiction to apply for tactical surplus military equipment. The ordinance or resolution shall comply with both of the following requirements:
(1) The ordinance shall include a list of the types of tactical surplus military equipment that the legislative body authorizes the local law enforcement agency to acquire.
(2) The legislative body shall review the ordinance or resolution at least annually. During the review, the legislative body shall vote on whether to renew the ordinance or resolution authorizing the acquisition of tactical surplus military equipment. If the legislative body does not approve a renewal pursuant to this paragraph, the authorization shall expire.
(c) This section shall not be construed to require the legislative body of a local agency to approve the acquisition of each individual item of tactical surplus military equipment, unless specified by the ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (b).
(d) The Legislature finds and declares that this section constitutes a matter of statewide concern, and shall apply to charter cities and charter counties. The provisions of this section shall supersede any inconsistent provisions in the charter of any city, county, or city and county.
(e) (1) The state coordinator, by January 31, 2016, shall develop a list of tactical surplus military equipment. The list shall identify surplus military equipment that warrants public input pursuant to this article. The state coordinator shall post this list on its Internet Web site and update it at least annually.
(2) In developing the list required by this subdivision, the state coordinator shall consider the current list of controlled property designated by the federal Defense Logistics Agency, as well as any other state or federal regulations or policies governing the use of surplus military equipment.
(3) The list required by this subdivision shall include, at minimum, the following types of equipment:
(A) Weapons.
(B) Armored vehicles.
(C) Watercraft.
(D) Aircraft.
(E) Other tactical equipment as determined by the state coordinator.
(f) Notwithstanding any other law, a local agency shall not apply to receive the following types of surplus military equipment:
(1) Tracked armored vehicles.
(2) Weaponized vehicles.
(3) Firearms of .50 caliber or greater.
(4) Ammunition of .50 caliber or greater.
(5) Grenade launchers.
(6) Bayonets.
(7) Camouflage uniforms.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 54145 to the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
Requiring local agencies to hold public meetings prior to the acquisition of federal surplus military equipment further exposes that activity to public scrutiny and enhances public access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII   B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Federal Surplus Property Acquisition Law of 1945, authorizes a local agency, as defined, to acquire surplus federal property without regard to any law which requires posting of notices or advertising for bids, inviting or receiving bids, delivery of purchases before payment, or prevents the local agency from bidding on federal surplus property. Existing federal law authorizes the Department of Defense to transfer surplus personal property, including arms and ammunition, to federal or state agencies for use in law enforcement activities, subject to specified conditions, at no cost to the acquiring agency.
This bill would prohibit a local agency, other than a local law enforcement agency that is directly under the control of an elected officer, from applying to receive tactical surplus military equipment, as defined, pursuant to the above-described federal law unless the legislative body of the local agency approves the acquisition by ordinance or resolution at a regular public meeting. The bill would require the ordinance or resolution to include a list of the types of tactical surplus military equipment and would require the legislative body to review the ordinance at least annually, as specified. The bill would prohibit a local agency from applying to receive specified types of equipment. The bill would also declare that this is a matter of statewide concern.
The bill would also require the state agency that has signed a current memorandum of agreement with the Defense Logistics Agency for the purpose of administering a state program for acquiring surplus military equipment to develop a list of tactical surplus military equipment by January 31, 2016, as specified, and post the list on its Internet Web site.
By adding to the duties of local government officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 54141 of, and to add Section 54145 to, the Government Code, relating to local government."

Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to ensure the safety of persons involved in investigations and to preserve the integrity of those investigations, it is necessary that this act take effect.","Existing law generally provides for the establishment of public libraries. Existing law requires every public library that receives specified state funds and that provides public access to the Internet or to video recordings to, by a majority vote of the governing board, adopt a policy regarding access by minors to the Internet or to video recordings.
This bill would require every public library that provides public access to a 3D printer, as defined, to post a notice on or near the 3D printer that would alert users of the 3D printer of the potential liability of the user for misuse of the 3D printer, as specified. This bill would require the Department of Justice to draft and distribute this notice, as specified, and annually review and revise the notice for accuracy. By imposing additional duties upon local officials, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.

This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system by September 30, 2015. Existing federal law requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop and implement operational and certification requirements for the operation of public unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace system by December 31, 2015.
This bill would generally prohibit public agencies from using unmanned aircraft systems, or contracting for the use of unmanned aircraft systems, as defined, with certain exceptions applicable to law enforcement agencies and in certain other cases, including when the use or operation of the unmanned aircraft system achieves the core mission of the agency and the purpose is unrelated to the gathering of criminal intelligence, as defined.
The bill would require reasonable public notice to be provided by public agencies intending to deploy unmanned aircraft systems, as specified. The bill would require images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system under these provisions to be permanently destroyed within one year, except as specified. The bill would generally prohibit images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system under these provisions from being disseminated outside the collecting public agency, except as specified. Unless authorized by federal law, the bill would prohibit a person or entity, including a public agency subject to these provisions, or a person or entity under contract to a public agency, for the purpose of that contract, from equipping or arming an unmanned aircraft system with a weapon or other device that may be carried by or launched from an unmanned aircraft system and that is intended to cause bodily injury or death, or damage to, or the destruction of, real or personal property. The bill would also provide that specified surveillance restrictions on electronic devices apply to the use or operation of an unmanned aircraft system by a public agency.
The bill would apply its provisions to all public and private entities when contracting with a public agency for the use of an unmanned aircraft system.
Existing law, the California Public Records Act, requires state and local agencies to make public records available for inspection, subject to certain exceptions.
This bill would make certain images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system under its provisions, or any related record, including, but not limited to, usage logs or logs that identify any person or entity that subsequently obtains or requests records of that system, subject to disclosure. The bill would except from disclosure above images, footage, data, and records obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system, if disclosure would endanger the safety of a person involved in an investigation, or would endanger the successful completion of the investigation.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

413,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) There are approximately 1.2 million adult Californians who suffer from severe mental illness and over 700,000 children in California who deal with severe emotional disturbance.
(2) Despite the importance of and emphasis on mental health parity, management of mental illness within a system of care is far more difficult than most types of physical illness. There are significant differences between the delivery systems for the Medi-Cal population and the delivery systems for those covered by private insurance, and there are unique problems associated with each system. While changes are needed in both, there is an immediate need to look for ways to better serve the insured population.
(3) The limited number of providers, the lack of facilities for treatment, and the difficulties of arranging for and coordinating ancillary services have made it extremely difficult for health insurers to meet the needs of enrollees facing significant mental health issues.
(4) Attempts to develop truly accessible provider networks that can link with the array of administrative and ancillary services that the mentally ill need to manage their disease and to improve will take an investment of time and resources.
(5) Systems of care known as Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) programs may hold the key to these problems. These integrated systems of care provide early intervention, assessment, diagnosis, a treatment plan, and the services necessary to implement that plan. EDAPT programs have interdisciplinary teams of physicians, clinicians, advocates, and staff that coordinate care on an outpatient basis.
(6) EDAPT programs do not yet exist in sufficient numbers to allow them to meet the provider network requirements health insurers must meet. While it is possible under existing law for health insurers to contract with existing EDAPT programs, there are a number of regulatory and practical issues that stand in the way of directing patients to them so that the patients’ conditions can be effectively managed. If insurers could designate an EDAPT program as an exclusive provider for their enrollees, an assessment could be made of the overall efficacy of the model.
(b) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide funding to augment private health benefit plan coverage in order to provide patients with the full range of necessary EDAPT services.
SEC. 2.
Part 6 (commencing with Section 5950) is added to Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
PART 6. EDAPT Funding Pilot Program
5950.
(a) There is hereby established the Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) Program Fund within the State Treasury. Moneys from private or other sources may be deposited into the fund and used for purposes of this part. General Fund moneys shall not be deposited into the fund.
(b) When the Department of Finance has determined that the total amount of the moneys in the fund established pursuant to subdivision (a) has reached or exceeded one million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000), the Controller shall distribute all of the moneys in the fund to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of providing reimbursement to an EDAPT program for services provided to persons who are referred to that program, but whose private health benefit plan does not cover the full range of required services.
(c) Funds distributed pursuant to this part shall not be used to pay for services normally covered by the patient’s private health benefit plan and shall only be used to augment private health benefit plan coverage to provide the patient with the full range of necessary services.
(d) For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “EDAPT program” means an Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment program and refers to a program that utilizes integrated systems of care to provide early intervention, assessment, diagnosis, a treatment plan, and necessary services for individuals with severe mental illness and children with severe emotional disturbance using an interdisciplinary team of physicians, clinicians, advocates, and staff who coordinate care on an outpatient basis.
(2) “Private health benefit plan” means a program or entity that provides, arranges, pays for, or reimburses the cost of health benefits, but does not include coverage provided through the Medi-Cal system.
5951.
(a) If the Regents of the University of California accept moneys from the fund established pursuant to this part, or accept federal funds distributed by the State Department of Health Care Services as described in subdivision (b), the regents shall report, on or after January 1, 2022, but prior to January 1, 2023, to the health committees of both houses of the Legislature all of the following:
(1) Evidence as to whether the early psychosis approach reduces the duration of untreated psychosis, reduces the severity of symptoms, improves relapse rates, decreases the use of inpatient care in comparison to standard care, supports educational and career progress, and reduces the cost of treatment in comparison to standard treatment methodologies.
(2) The number of patients with private health benefit plans served by an EDAPT program in the 12 months prior to the implementation of this part.
(3) The number of patients with private health benefit plans served by an EDAPT program that has received funding pursuant to this part.
(4) The number of patients participating in an EDAPT program that has received funding pursuant to this part who are considered stabilized, as a percentage of patients served.
(5) The number of patients participating in an EDAPT program that has received funding pursuant to this part who need services beyond those provided in the program and the nature of those services.
(6) Any other information the regents deem necessary.
(b) If the State Department of Health Care Services distributes federal funds to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of supporting an EDAPT program, the regents shall issue the report described in subdivision (a), to the extent permitted by federal law.
(c) A report to be submitted pursuant to this section shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
5952.
This part shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2023, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2023, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law, the Bronzan-McCorquodale Act, sets out a system of community mental health care services provided by counties and administered by the State Department of Health Care Services.
This bill would establish the Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) Program Fund in the State Treasury to provide funding to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of providing reimbursement to an EDAPT program that would utilize integrated systems of care to provide early intervention, assessment, diagnosis, a treatment plan, and necessary services for individuals with severe mental illness and children with severe emotional disturbance, as specified. The bill would authorize moneys from private or other sources to be deposited into the fund and used for purposes of the bill. The bill would require, when the Department of Finance has determined that the total amount of the moneys in the fund has reached or exceeded $1,200,000, the Controller to distribute all of the moneys in the fund to the Regents of the University of California for the purpose of providing reimbursement to an EDAPT program for services provided to persons who are referred to that program, but whose private health benefit plan, as defined, does not cover the full range of required services, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the Regents of the University of California, if the regents accept the money, or if the regents accept federal funding distributed by the State Department of Health Care Services for the purpose of supporting an EDAPT program, as specified, to report, on or after January 1, 2022, but prior to January 1, 2023, specified information to the health committees of both houses of the Legislature. The bill would repeal the program as of January 1, 2023.","An act to add and repeal Part 6 (commencing with Section 5950) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health, and making an appropriation therefor."

Article 5 (commencing with Section 15645) is added to Chapter 9 of Division 15 of the Elections Code, to read:
Article  5. State-Funded Recounts
15645.
(a) (1) Within five days after the Secretary of State files a statement of the vote, as required by subdivision (b) of Section 15501, the Governor may order a state-funded manual recount of all votes cast for a statewide office or state ballot measure if any of the following occurs, except as provided in paragraph (3):
(A) The official canvass of returns in a statewide primary election shows that the difference in the number of votes received by the second and third place candidates for a statewide office is less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast for that office except as provided in paragraph (2).
(B) The official canvass of returns in a statewide general election shows that the difference in the number of votes received by the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes for a statewide office is less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast for that office.
(C) The official canvass of returns in a statewide election shows that the difference in the number of votes cast for and against a state ballot measure is less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast on the measure.
(2) The Governor shall not order a state-funded manual recount of all votes cast for the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to this section unless the official canvass of returns in a statewide primary election shows either of the following:
(A) The number of votes received by the candidate receiving the greatest number of votes was either of the following:
(i) Between 0.49985 and 0.50015, inclusive, of the number of all votes cast.
(ii) Within 1,000 votes of 50 percent of the number of all votes cast.
(B) No candidate for the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction received votes on a majority of all the ballots cast for candidates for that office and the difference in the number of votes received by the second and third place candidates for that office was less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast for that office.
(3) If the conditions set forth in paragraph (1) are satisfied with respect to the number of votes cast for the office of Governor, the Secretary of State, but not the Governor, may order a state-funded manual recount pursuant to this section.
(4) For purposes of this subdivision, “statewide office” means the office of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Controller, Insurance Commissioner, Secretary of State, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Treasurer, or Member of the United States Senate.
(b) If a state-funded recount is conducted pursuant to this section, no other recount shall be conducted.
(c) The State shall reimburse counties for costs resulting from conducting a manual recount pursuant to this section in an expeditious manner upon certification of those costs.
15646.
(a) Upon the Governor or Secretary of State ordering a recount pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 15645, the Secretary of State shall notify the elections official of each county and shall direct the county elections officials to recount all the votes cast for the office or for and against the state ballot measure.
(b) (1) While conducting a recount pursuant to Section 15645, a county elections official shall also review ballots rejected pursuant to Section 15154 to ensure that no ballots were improperly discarded during the initial canvass.
(2) The process of reviewing rejected ballots pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be open to members of the public, including persons associated with a campaign or measure.
(c)  The elections official in each county shall complete a recount pursuant to this section as follows:
(1) In a primary election, by three business days before the Secretary of State issues the certified list of candidates for the associated general election pursuant to Section 8120.
(2) In a general election, within 60 days of the Governor or Secretary of State ordering the recount.

15648.
The Secretary of State may adopt, amend, and repeal rules and regulations necessary for the administration of this article.
15649.
A county elections official shall only be required to conduct a recount pursuant to this article to the extent funds are appropriated for purposes of this article in the annual Budget Act or other statute.
SEC. 9.
Section 19204.5 is added to the Elections Code, to read:
19204.5.
(a) The Secretary of State shall not certify or conditionally approve a voting system that cannot facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit.
(b) (1) For purposes of this subdivision, a voting system that is “noncompliant” is a voting system that cannot facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit.
(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the Secretary of State may, until January 1, 2021, approve a proposed change or modification to a noncompliant voting system even if the voting system will remain noncompliant after the change or modification. This paragraph shall become inoperative on January 1, 2021.
SEC. 10.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations relating to the use of voting systems in recounting ballots.
This bill would also require the Secretary of State to revise and adopt regulations relating to procedures for recounting ballots, including regulations establishing guidelines for the charges a county elections official may impose when conducting a manual recount.
(2) Existing law establishes procedures by which a voter may request a recount of the votes cast in an election following completion of the official canvass. Existing law requires a voter to make this request within 5 days beginning on the 29th day after the election.
This bill would instead permit a voter to file a request for a recount within 5 days beginning on the 30th day after the election.
(3) Any time during the conduct of a recount and for 24 hours thereafter, existing law permits any other voter to request a recount of any precincts in an election for the same office, slate of presidential electors, or measure not recounted as a result of the original request. Existing law also provides that, where applicable, a voter requesting a recount may select whether the recount shall be conducted manually, or by means of the voting system used originally, or both.
This bill would instead require a voter to select, for each type of voting system used, whether the recount is to be conducted manually, or by means of the voting system used originally, but not both. This bill would also specify that if more than one voter requests a recount of the same office or measure, and at least one request is for a manual recount, then the county elections official of any county subject to multiple requests is only obligated to conduct one manual recount of the ballots subject to the request, and that those results will control.
(4) Under existing law, a voter seeking a recount is required, before the recount is commenced and at the beginning of each subsequent day, to deposit with the elections official the amount of money required by the elections official to cover the cost of the recount for that day.
This bill would permit the Governor or Secretary of State, as specified, to order a state-funded manual recount of all votes cast for a statewide office or a state ballot measure if the difference in the number of votes received is less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast, as specified. This bill would also require a county elections official to review rejected ballots as part of a state-funded recount.
(5) Under existing law, upon completion of a recount showing that a different candidate was nominated or elected, that a different presidential slate of electors received a plurality of the votes, or that a measure was defeated instead of approved or approved instead of defeated, the result of the recount in each affected precinct is entered and is thereafter considered the official return of the affected precincts. Existing law provides that if an office, slates of presidential electors, or measure is voted on statewide, the results of any recount are null and void unless each vote cast for the office, slates, or measure in any county specified in the request for recount is recounted.
This bill would instead provide that if an office, slates of presidential electors, or measure is voted on statewide, the results of any recount are null and void unless each vote cast statewide for the office, slates, or measure is recounted.
(6) Existing law requires the Secretary of State to certify or conditionally approve a voting system prior to any election at which it is to be used, as specified. Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system or part of a voting system that does not have certain technical capabilities.
This bill would also prohibit the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system that cannot facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit; however, it would expressly permit the Secretary of State to approve a proposed change or modification to a noncompliant voting system even if the voting system would be unable to facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit after the change or modification.
By imposing new duties on local elections officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 15601, 15620, 15621, 15626, 15627, and 15632, of, to add Sections 15621.5 and 19204.5 to, and to add Article 5 (commencing with Section 15645) to Chapter 9 of Division 15 of, the Elections Code, relating to elections."
415,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)  In 1977, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that feeding livestock low doses of antibiotics from antibiotic classes that are used in human disease treatment could promote the development of antibiotic-resistance in bacteria and pose a risk to human health. The FDA, however, did not act in response to these findings, despite laws requiring the agency to do so.
(b)  The FDA issued voluntary guidance in December 2013 on the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics; however, this guidance is unlikely to significantly reduce the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock because of a broad exemption allowing for the use of antibiotics for disease prevention.
(c)  Not only do antibiotic-resistant bacteria affect the health of our society, but they also have a monetary impact. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of four to five billion dollars in costs to United States society and individuals every year. In 2009, in a study funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cook County Hospital and Alliance for Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health care cost of antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States was between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually. Societal costs from lost productivity due to illnesses were estimated to be an additional $35 billion.
(d)  In April 1999, the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a study concluding that three strains of microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals. These microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals. These microorganisms are salmonella, campylobacter, and E. Coli.
(e)  In 1999, 2006, and 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service conducted large-scale, voluntary surveys that revealed all of the following:
(1)  Eighty-four percent of grower and finisher swine farms, 83 percent of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep farms administer antimicrobials in feed or water for either health or growth promotion reasons.
(2)  Many of the antimicrobials that were identified were identical or closely related to drugs used in human medicine, including tetracyclines, macrolides, bactricin, penicilllins, and sulfonamides.
(3)  These drugs are used in people to treat serious diseases, such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, sexually transmitted infections, and skin infections; pandemics such as malaria and plague; and bioterrorism agents such as anthrax.
(f) In June 2002, the peer-reviewed journal, “Clinical Infectious Diseases,” published a report based on a two-year review, by experts in human and veterinary medicine, public health, microbiology, biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more than 500 scientific studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in agriculture. The report recommended that antimicrobial agents should not be used in agriculture in the absence of disease and should be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals or prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock.
(g) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of Sciences stated that a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little effect on the rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and that substantial efforts must be made to decrease the inappropriate overuse of antimicrobials in animals and agriculture.
(h) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal, “Molecular Cell,” published a study demonstrating that a low-dosage use of antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.
(i) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration testified that the Danish ban of the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.
(j) In 2011, the FDA found that in 2010:
(1) Thirteen million five hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold for use on food animals in the United States.
(2) Three million three hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used for human health.
(3) Eighty percent of antibacterial drugs, and over 70 percent of medically important antibacterial drugs, disseminated in the United States were sold for use on food-producing animals, rather than being used for human health.
(k) In 2011, a review of all scientific studies on antimicrobial use in farm animals, published in Clinical Microbiology Reviews, found the following:
(1) That the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals leads to the development of reservoirs of antibiotic resistance, that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread through food, water, air, soil, and meat-industry workers, and that bacteria can share resistance genes with each other.
(2) A ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in food-producing animals would preserve the use of antibiotics for medicine.
(3) A Danish ban on nontherapeutic antibiotics in food-producing animals resulted in little change in animal morbidity and mortality, and only a modest increase in production cost.
(l) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded in a recent report, “Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013,” that overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human medicine or in agriculture. The CDC estimated that antibiotic resistance causes at least 23,000 deaths and two million illnesses every year.
(m) In 2013, the peer-reviewed journal, “The Journal of the American Medical Association,” published a study showing higher levels of antibiotic-resistant skin and soft-tissue infections in people living in proximity to hog farms or fields treated with swine manure in Pennsylvania. Similarly, in 2014, the peer-reviewed journal, “Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,” published a study focused on hospitalized veterans in rural areas of Iowa, finding that people living in close proximity to a swine-feeding operation were nearly three times as likely to have been affected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the time of admission to the hospital.
(n) The FDA’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics that are important to human medicine.
(o) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, “the largest nonhuman use of antimicrobial agents is in food-producing animal production, and most of this is in healthy animals to increase growth or prevent diseases. Evidence now exists that these uses of antimicrobial agents in food-producing animals have a direct negative impact on human health and multiple impacts on the selection and dissemination of resistance genes in animals and the environment. Children are at increased risk of acquiring many of these infections with resistant bacteria and are at great risk of severe complications if they become infected.”
(p) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people.
(q) The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a risk to the health of Californians and reduced use of antibiotics for livestock production is likely to reduce the risks of the rise and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food and other pathways, thus reducing the risk to Californians.
SEC. 2.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production.","Under existing law, the Department of Food and Agriculture is responsible for enforcing provisions relating to the importation of animals, milk and milk products, produce dealers, and other agricultural regulations. Existing law requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to make and enforce provisions relating to the manufacture, sale, and use of livestock drugs.
This bill would make various legislative findings and declarations relating to the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock, and would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production.",An act relating to livestock drugs.
416,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to United States Census Bureau, California has a poverty rate of 23.5 percent, the highest rate of any state in the country.
(b) Children born into poverty are at higher risk of health and developmental disparities, including, but not limited to, premature birth, low birth weight, infant mortality, crime, domestic violence, developmental delays, dropping out of high school, substance abuse, unemployment, and child abuse and neglect.
(c) In 2014, the Legislature passed Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 155 by Assembly Member Raul Bocanegra, recognizing that research over the last two decades in the evolving fields of neuroscience, molecular biology, public health, genomics, and epigenetics reveals that experiences in the first few years of life build changes into the biology of the human body that, in turn, influence the person’s physical and mental health over his or her lifetime.
(d) On May 3, 2012, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued Executive Order B-19-12, establishing the “Let’s Get Healthy California Task Force” to develop a 10-year plan for improving the health of Californians, controlling health care costs, promoting personal responsibility for individual health, and advancing health equity.
(e) The task force identified several priorities, including a subset for “Healthy Beginnings,” which include reducing infant deaths, increasing vaccination rates, reducing childhood trauma, and reducing adolescent tobacco use.
(f) The final report of the task force states, “the challenge going forward is to identify evidence-based interventions and quicken the pace of uptake across the state” in order to meet the ambitious goals in the Governor’s directive.
(g) Voluntary evidence-based home visiting programs, such as Nurse-Family Partnership, Healthy Families America, Early Head Start (Home-Based Program Option), Parents as Teachers, and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters, strengthen the critical parent-child relationship and connect families with information and resources during the pivotal time from pregnancy to five years of age. Extensive research has shown that evidence-based home visiting programs serving pregnant and parenting mothers, prenatal to the child turning five years of age, increase family self-sufficiency, positive parenting practices, child literacy and school readiness, and maternal and child health.
(h) Voluntary evidence-based home visiting program models focused on the prenatal period to five years of age range from low to high intensity, reflecting the broad spectrum of family needs that home visiting can impact. Many experts hail home visiting program diversity as essential to providing parents with choices and ensuring that programs are well matched with local needs and strengths, as well as responsive to the diverse needs of California’s children and families.
(i) In 2013, more than 248,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries gave birth to a child. Because Medi-Cal covers half of all births in the state, this has increased costs for taxpayers. Medi-Cal expansion has resulted in an 18 percent increase in Medi-Cal enrollment to a total of 11.3 million, and enrollment is expected to exceed 12 million in 2015.
(j) The California Health and Human Services Agency recently submitted its State Health Care Innovation Plan, including the Maternity Care initiative, which addresses issues of high costs in maternity care, to the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Child deliveries and related expenses, including high-risk births, rank among the top 10 high-cost episodes of health care, and in the last 15 years, California has seen a continual rise in maternal mortality.
(k) The cost of health care specifically related to high-risk pregnancies, neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) services, toxic stress, and emergency room visits has increased and is projected to continue to rise. Average health care costs for women were 25 percent more than men primarily due to higher costs of health care during childbearing years.
(l) With more than three decades of evidence from randomized, controlled trials and rigorous followup evaluation studies, evidence-based home visiting programs have demonstrated sustained improvements in maternal health, child health, positive parenting practices, child development and school readiness, reductions in child maltreatment, family economic self-sufficiency, linkages and referrals, and reductions in family violence.
(m) Evidence-based home visiting programs have specifically demonstrated reductions in preterm births, preventable maternal mortality, smoking during pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, closely spaced subsequent births, childhood injuries resulting in costly emergency department use and hospitalizations, improved childhood immunization rates, compliance with well child visit schedules, lower body mass index rates, higher birth weights, and improved family well-being, including increased family health literacy, and parent self-help development. As a result of families benefiting from evidence-based home visiting, there have been cost savings to federal, state, and local governments with respect to programs and services, including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
(n) The strong evidence of effectiveness and predictable return on investment demonstrate that evidence-based home visiting programs should be brought to scale in California to improve maternal and child health outcomes and help reduce health care costs for generations to come.
(o) By supporting families from the start, voluntary evidence-based home visiting programs serving families from prenatal to five years of age provide a foundation for subsequent early childhood programs and family support efforts to build upon, and can help ensure that families are well-equipped to raise California’s next generation of productive, healthy, and successful adults.
(p) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to develop a means to leverage public and private dollars to substantially expand the scale of evidence-based home visiting programs throughout California, beginning with communities and populations with the greatest need.
SEC. 2.
Section 14148.25 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
14148.25.
(a) The department shall, in consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to, representatives from Medi-Cal managed care plans, public and private hospitals, evidence-based home visiting programs, and other governmental entities including local and state law enforcement and corrections agencies, local and state social services agencies, and local and state educational agencies, develop a feasibility plan on or before January 1, 2017, that describes the costs, benefits, and any potential barriers related to offering evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women. The department shall consult with stakeholders from diverse geographical regions of the state. The department shall consider all of the following in developing the plan:
(1) Establishing Medi-Cal coverage for evidence-based home visiting program services.
(2) Incentives for Medi-Cal providers to offer evidence-based home visiting program services.
(3) Other mechanisms to fund evidence-based home visiting program services for Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women.
(4) Identifying among evidence-based home visiting programs those with established evidence to improve health outcomes, the experience of care, and cost savings to the health care system.
(b) In developing the plan, the department shall prioritize the identification of funding sources, other than General Fund moneys, to fund evidence-based home visiting program services, including local, federal, or private funds, or any other funds made available for these program services.
(c) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Evidence-based program” means a program that is based on scientific evidence demonstrating that the program model is effective. An evidence-based program shall be reviewed on site and compared to program model standards by the model developer or the developer’s designee at least every five years to ensure that the program continues to maintain fidelity with the program model. The program model shall have had demonstrated and replicated significant and sustained positive outcomes that have been in one or more well-designed and rigorous randomized controlled research designs, and the evaluation results shall have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
(2) “Evidence-based home visiting program” means a program or initiative that does all of the following:
(A) Meets, on or before April 1, 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) criteria, as described in Section 511(d)(3)(A)(i)(l) of Title V of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 711).
(B) Contains home visiting as a primary service delivery strategy by providers satisfying home visiting program requirements to provide services to families with a pregnant or parenting woman who is eligible for medical assistance.
(C) Offers services on a voluntary basis to pregnant women, expectant fathers, and parents and caregivers of children from prenatal to five years of age.
(D) Targets participant outcomes that include all of the following:
(i) Improved maternal and child health.
(ii) Prevention of child injuries, child abuse or maltreatment, and reduction of emergency department visits.
(iii) Improvements in school readiness and achievement.
(iv) Reduction in crime or domestic violence.
(v) Improvements in family economic self-sufficiency.
(vi) Improvements in coordination of, and referrals to, other community resources and support.
(vii) Improvements in parenting skills related to child development.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including perinatal services for pregnant women.
Existing law establishes the Nurse-Family Partnership program, which is administered by the State Department of Public Health, to provide grants for voluntary nurse home visiting programs for expectant first-time mothers, their children, and their families. Under existing law, a county is required to satisfy specified requirements in order to be eligible to receive a grant.
This bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services, in consultation with specified stakeholders, to develop a feasibility plan on or before January 1, 2017, that describes the costs, benefits, and any potential barriers related to offering evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women. The bill would also require the department, in developing the plan, to consider, among other things, establishing Medi-Cal coverage for evidence-based home visiting program services and incentives for Medi-Cal providers to offer those services, and would require the department, in developing the plan, to prioritize the identification of funding sources, other than General Fund moneys, to fund evidence-based home visiting program services.","An act to add Section 14148.25 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to perinatal care."

(b) A county that provides assisted outpatient treatment services pursuant to this article also shall offer the same services on a voluntary basis.

Section 5349.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5349.5.
This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2022, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2022, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law, the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Demonstration Project Act of 2002, known as Laura’s Law, until January 1, 2017, grants each county the authority to offer certain assisted outpatient treatment services for their residents by adoption of a resolution or through the county budget process and by making a finding that no mental health program, as specified, may be reduced as a result of implementation. Under that law, participating counties are required to provide prescribed assisted outpatient services, including a service planning and delivery process, that are client-directed and employ psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery principles. Existing law authorizes participating counties to pay for the services provided from moneys distributed to the counties from various continuously appropriated funds, including the Local Revenue Fund and the Mental Health Services Fund when included in a county plan, as specified. Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to submit a report and evaluation of all counties implementing any component of these provisions to the Governor and the Legislature by July 1, 2015.
This bill would extend the operation of the program until January 1, 2022, and would delete that reporting requirement. By extending the authorization to pay for the services using moneys from various continuously appropriated funds, the bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law requires a county that operates an assisted outpatient treatment program pursuant to these provisions to provide data to the department, and requires the department to report to the Legislature on or before May 1 of each year based on that data, as specified.
This bill would additionally require the department to report that information to the Governor.","An act to amend Sections 5348 and 5349.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health services, and making an appropriation therefor."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 6.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to implement measures as quickly as possible and as necessary to prevent fraud on immigrants by attorneys and other persons by making promises of benefits and relief under pending and proposed federal immigration reform acts before their enactment or before their relief and remedies become available, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law, the State Bar Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of attorneys by the State Bar of California, a public corporation. Existing law prohibits an attorney from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law requires the State Bar to provide specified information relating to immigration reform act services on its Internet Web site.
This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President’s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States without inspection, who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, or who stayed beyond an approved period, to attain a lawful status under federal law or to otherwise remain in the country. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued. This bill would provide that it is unlawful for an attorney to demand or accept the advance payment of any funds for immigration reform act services in connection with requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, requests for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or other future relief, as provided, under federal law. This bill would also provide that an advance payment of funds for immigration reform act services may be placed into a client trust account, as specified.
Existing law provides for the regulation of a person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of an immigration consultant, and provides that a violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires an immigration consultant to establish a client trust account and to deposit in this account any funds received from the client prior to performing immigration reform act services, as defined, for that client. Existing law prohibits an immigration consultant from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law prescribes civil penalties, not to exceed $1,000 per day for each violation, for immigration consultants who violate these provisions.
This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President’s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who either entered the United States without inspection or who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, to attain a lawful status under federal law. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued. This bill would provide that it is unlawful for an immigration consultant to demand or accept the advance payment of any funds for immigration reform act services in connection with requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, requests for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, expanded Provisional Waivers of Unlawful Presence, or other future relief, as provided, under federal law.
Because a violation of these provisions by an immigration consultant would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 6240, 6242, 22442.5, and 22442.6 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to immigration services, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

The bill would require the department to develop a matching grant program for local jurisdictions that would either allow the state to apply for federal matching funds on behalf of a local law enforcement entity, or to reimburse a local law enforcement entity that has expended its funds for purposes of obtaining federal matching funds for body-worn cameras, as described.

The retention period for evidentiary data are subject to state evidentiary laws.
(2) For purposes of this section, “nonevidentiary data” refers to data that does not necessarily have value to aid in an investigation or prosecution, such as data of an incident or encounter that does not lead to an arrest or citation, or data of general activities the officer might perform while on duty.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit the public’s right to access recorded data under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).","Existing law makes it a crime to intentionally record a confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the communication. Existing law exempts specified peace officers from that provision if they are acting within the scope of their authority.
This bill would require law enforcement agencies to consider specified best practices when establishing policies and procedures for downloading and storing data from body-worn cameras, including, among other things, prohibiting the unauthorized use, duplication, or distribution of the data, and establishing storage periods for evidentiary and nonevidentiary data, as defined.","An act to add Section 832.18 to the Penal Code, relating to peace officers."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) On February 27, 2014, the President of the United States launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and to ensure that all young people can reach their full potential.
(b) The My Brother’s Keeper Task Force recognizes that challenges facing boys and young men of color affect others as well and that it is important to break down barriers wherever they exist and to identify means of creating ladders of opportunity for all.
(c) The My Brother’s Keeper Task Force was established to develop a coordinated federal effort to significantly improve the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans, and to improve their contributions to the nation’s prosperity, so that all youth have an equal opportunity at achieving the American dream.
(d) The My Brother’s Keeper Task Force noted that significant diversity exists within and among boys and men of color as a segment of the population. Differences of language status, income, disability, sexual orientation, and many other factors influence the identity and experience of these young people, just as with any other population.
(e) My Brother’s Keeper is focused on the following milestones: (1) getting a healthy start and entering school ready to learn; (2) reading at grade level by third grade; (3) graduating from high school ready for college and career; (4) completing postsecondary education or training; (5) successfully entering the workforce; and (6) keeping kids on track and giving them second chances.
(f) The My Brother’s Keeper Task Force Report to the President (May 2014) cites numerous areas in which boys and men of color consistently experience disproportionately negative outcomes. These areas include living in poverty, living without a male parent in the household, high school dropout rates, unemployment, death by homicide, and imprisonment.
(g) The My Brother’s Keeper Task Force has identified initial recommendations and areas of opportunity at each of these key milestones or “focus areas.” The task force has also identified several cross-cutting areas of opportunity that span all focus areas.
(h) The recommendations in the My Brother’s Keeper Task Force Report to the President inform and influence California policy and California’s compliance with those recommendations makes the state more competitive for federal funding and strengthens its economic competitiveness.
(i) Our state’s future prosperity and health depend on all Californians having a fair chance to thrive and succeed. One of the best investments we can make is to be certain we do everything possible to help young people become healthy, productive adults. As California becomes more diverse, we must nurture and harness the talents, skills, and hopes of young people of color — boys and young men in particular.
(j) The Department of Finance projects California’s population of boys and men of color will increasingly represent a growing percentage of the state's male population, reaching close to 80 percent for boys and men of color compared to 20 percent for non-Hispanic white males by 2050.
(k) The Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California has recognized that boys and young men of color are in jeopardy, and this poses a serious threat to California’s economic strength and competitiveness.
(l) The Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color’s policy framework emphasizes the following issues: (1) health and safety; (2) education; (3) juvenile justice; (4) employment and wealth; and (5) youth development. Related issues that have been recommended for expansion of the committee’s work include higher education, immigration, and housing.
(m) Community and youth leaders from across the state have taken a significant interest in partnering with government and systems leaders through the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color in order to improve the health and success of our state’s young people of color.

Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 50408 of the Health and Safety Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 388. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, (2) each bill amends Section 50408 of the Health and Safety Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 388, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.","Existing law establishes the Department of Housing and Community Development in the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency. The department is responsible for administering various housing and home loan programs throughout the state. Existing law also establishes the California Housing Finance Agency within the department, and provides that the primary purpose of the agency is to meet the housing needs of persons and families of low to moderate income.
Existing federal law requires the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish a Housing Trust Fund to provide grants to states to increase the supply of rental housing for extremely low- and very low income families, including homeless families, and home ownership for extremely low- and very low income families.
This bill would designate the Department of Housing and Community Development as the state agency responsible for administering funds received by the state from the federal Housing Trust Fund. This bill would require the department to administer the funds through existing or newly created programs that produce, preserve, rehabilitate, or support the operation of rental housing for extremely low income and very low income households, except that up to 10% of funding may be used to support home ownership for extremely low income and very low income households. The bill would require any rental project funded from the federal Housing Trust Fund to restrict affordability for 55 years, as specified, and require any home ownership program funded from the federal Housing Trust Fund to restrict affordability for 30 years, as specified.
This bill would require the department to collaborate with the California Housing Finance Agency to develop an allocation plan to demonstrate how the funds will be distributed, based on the priority housing needs identified in the state’s consolidated plan, and to convene a stakeholder process to inform the development of the plan. The bill would require the allocation plan and guidelines to give priority to projects based on specified factors. The bill would require the department to submit the plan to the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development and the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee 30 days after receipt of the federal funds.
The bill would authorize the department to adopt, amend, or repeal guidelines to implement these provisions. The bill would exempt these guidelines from the Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law requires, on or before December 31 of each year, the department to submit an annual report, containing specified information, to the Governor and both houses of the Legislature on the operations and accomplishments during the previous fiscal year of the housing programs administered by the department.
This bill would require that annual report to also include an evaluation of any program established by the department to meet the legal requirements of the Federal Housing Trust Fund program guidelines.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 50408 of the Healthy and Safety Code proposed by AB 388 that would become operative if this bill and AB 388 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.","An act to amend Section 50408 of, and to add Chapter 6.8 (commencing with Section 50676) to Part 2 of Division 31 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing."

SEC. 13.
This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.","(1) Existing law requires any new diversion of water from any stream having populations of salmon and steelhead that is determined by the Department of Fish and Wildlife to be deleterious to salmon and steelhead to be screened by the owner of the diversion. Existing law requires the department to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead within 30 days of receipt of a notice of a diversion of water from a stream having populations of salmon and steelhead.
This bill would instead require the department, within 30 days of providing written notice to the owner that the department has determined that the diversion is deleterious to salmon and steelhead, to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead.
(2) Existing law prohibits the construction or maintenance, in certain fish and game districts, of any device or contrivance that prevents, impedes, or tends to prevent or impede, the passing of fish up and down stream. A violation of this provision is a misdemeanor.
This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $8,000 for a violation of this provision.
(3) Existing law declares that the diversion or use of water other than as authorized by specified provisions of law is a trespass. Existing law authorizes the executive director of the State Water Resources Control Board to issue a complaint to a person who violates certain laws regarding the use and diversion of water, and subjects the violator to administrative civil liability. Existing law requires that the complaint be served by personal notice or certified mail and inform the party served that the party may request a hearing not later than 20 days from the date the party was served.
This bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or his or her designee, to issue a complaint in accordance with the above-specified provisions alleging that an unauthorized diversion or use of water harms fish and wildlife resources.
(4) Existing law prohibits a charter city from receiving or using state funding or financial assistance for a construction project if the city has a charter provision or ordinance that authorizes a contractor to not comply with prevailing wage provisions on any public works contract or if the city has awarded, within the prior 2 years, a public works contract without requiring the contractor to comply with prevailing wage provisions, as specified. Existing law authorizes charter cities to receive or use state funding or financial assistance if the city has a local prevailing wage ordinance, applicable to all of its public works contracts, that includes requirements that are equal to or greater than the state’s prevailing wage requirements, as specified.
This bill would exempt from that prohibition funding and financial assistance provided to a charter city in response to an emergency.
(5) Existing law provides various technical assistance opportunities to disadvantaged communities for projects relating to groundwater sustainability, clean drinking water, and water recycling and advanced treatment water technology projects.
This bill would establish the Office of Sustainable Water Solutions within the State Water Resources Control Board to promote permanent and sustainable drinking water and wastewater treatment solutions to ensure effective and efficient provision of safe, clean, affordable, and reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment services. The bill would authorize the office to take certain actions in furtherance of this purpose.
(6) Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, authorizes the imposition and collection of civil and criminal penalties for specified violations of that act. The act requires certain moneys, including General Fund revenues of penalties, collected pursuant to these provisions to be deposited in the State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account in the State Water Quality Control Fund. The act continuously appropriates the moneys in the account to the State Water Resources Control Board for specified cleanup programs.
The act authorizes the state board, upon application by a public agency, specified tribal governments, or not-for-profit organizations serving disadvantaged communities that have authority to clean up a waste or abate the effects of a waste to order moneys in the account to be paid to the entity to assist in cleaning up the waste or abating its effects on waters.
This bill would, until July 1, 2018, additionally authorize the state board to pay these moneys to a community water system that serves a disadvantaged community and would authorize moneys in the account to be used to assist in addressing an urgent drinking water need. By authorizing new expenditures from a continuously appropriated account, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would exempt projects using moneys paid pursuant to these provisions from state contracting and procurement requirements, as specified, and would authorize the state board to adopt guidelines for the allocation and administration of moneys in the account that would be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act.
(7) Existing law establishes the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund and provides that the moneys in the fund are available to the Department of Water Resources, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of water use efficiency projects. Existing law requires moneys in the fund to be used for purposes that include, but are not limited to, at or below market interest rate loans to local agencies, as defined, and permits the department to enter into agreements with local agencies that provide water or recycled water service to provide loans.
Existing law, the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. The bond act provides that the sum of $810,000,000 is to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for expenditures on, and competitive grants and loans to, projects that are included in and implemented in an adopted integrated regional water management plan and respond to climate change and contribute to regional water security. The bond act authorizes the use of $100,000,000 of those funds for direct expenditures, and for grants and loans, for certain water conservation and water use efficiency plans, projects, and programs.
This bill would transfer to the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund the sum of $10,000,000 of the proceeds of these bonds for water conservation and water use efficiency projects and programs to achieve urban water use targets. This bill would require the department to use $5,000,000 for a pilot project for local agencies to provide water efficiency upgrades to eligible residents. This bill would require the department to use the other $5,000,000 for local agencies to provide low-interest loans to customers to finance the installation of onsite improvements to repair or replace, as necessary, cracked or leaking water pipes to conserve water. The bill would authorize the department to provide local agencies with zero-interest loans of up to $3,000,000 and would require a local agency that receives a loan pursuant to these provisions to exercise reasonable efforts to recover the costs of the loan. The bill would also authorize the department to waive up to 10% of the repayment amount for costs that could not be recovered by a local agency.
(8) The State Contract Act generally provides for a contracting process by state agencies for public works of improvement pursuant to a competitive bidding process, under which bids are awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, with specified alternative bidding procedures authorized in certain cases.
Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, sets forth the emergency powers of the Governor under its provisions and empowers the Governor to proclaim a state of emergency for certain conditions, including drought. During a state of emergency, existing law authorizes the Governor to suspend any regulatory statute, or statute prescribing the procedure for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency where the Governor determines and declares that strict compliance with any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency. Pursuant to this authority, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency, and a continued state of emergency, due to drought conditions and suspended certain statutes.
This bill would suspend the provisions of the Government Code and the Public Contract Code applicable to state contracts for purposes of state agencies implementing the Governor’s orders proclaiming a state of emergency as long as the state of emergency due to drought conditions remains in effect. The bill would specify that these suspensions only apply to contracts that respond to conditions arising from the drought and that support the state agencies in specified actions. The bill would require approval by the Department of Finance prior to the execution of any contract entered into pursuant to this provision and would require that certain information relating to these contracts be posted on the California Drought Internet Web site.
This bill would require an agency receiving moneys from one or more sources as appropriated pursuant to Assembly Bill 91 or Senate Bill 75 of the 2015–16 Regular Session to use the services of the California Conservation Corps or a certified community conservation corps, as defined, for restoration, ecosystem protection projects, or other similar work.
(9) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","An act to amend Section 6100 of, and to add Sections 12025.1 and 12025.2 to, the Fish and Game Code, to add Section 8687.9 to the Government Code, to amend Section 4629.6 of the Public Resources Code, and to amend Section 81046 of, to amend, repeal, and add Section 13442 of, and to add Sections 189 and 81023 to, the Water Code, relating to water, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

(a) There is worldwide concern regarding the plight of elephants and rhinoceroses, who are being poached at alarming rates — an average of 96 elephants per day are killed in Africa.

(c) International, federal, and state laws are all being strengthened to protect these iconic species from cruelty and extinction. The states of New York and New Jersey recently enacted strong prohibitions on intrastate ivory and rhinoceros horn commerce and the federal government has proposed strengthened ivory trade and import regulations.

SEC. 5.
This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.
SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, would allow an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment in excess of that amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law requires any bill authorizing a new personal income tax credit to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax credit will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements, as provided.
To measure whether the earned income credit achieves its intended purpose, this bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to annually prepare a specified written report and to provide that report to specified legislative committees.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account, and provides that payments required to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account.
By authorizing new payments from that account for amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, this bill would make an appropriation.
The Personal Income Tax Law imposes taxes based upon taxable income and also imposes interest and penalties with regard to those taxes under specified circumstances, including a penalty for the underpayment of estimated tax. Existing law provides no addition to tax shall be imposed to the extent that the underpayment was created or increased by any law that is chaptered during and operative for the taxable year of the underpayment.
This bill would provide that addition to tax shall not be imposed if the applicable percentage for the earned income tax credit for the taxable year was less than the applicable percentage for that credit for the preceding taxable year and would impose a penalty, in conformity with federal law, for failure to be diligent in determining eligibility for the earned income tax credit, as specified.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","An act relating to the Budget Act of 2015.
An act to amend Sections 19136 and 19167 of, and to add Section 17052 to, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

The board shall defer all augmentations in excess of 20 percent of the amount appropriated for each design-build project until the Legislature makes additional funds available for the specific project.
(e) In addition to the powers provided by Section 15849.6, the State Public Works Board may further increase the additional amount in Section 15849.6 to include a reasonable construction reserve within the construction fund for any capital outlay project without augmenting the project. The amount of the construction reserve shall be within the 20 percent augmentation limitation. The board may use this amount to augment the project, when and if necessary, after the lease-revenue bonds are sold to ensure completion of the project.

Each bond issued under this part, if subject to call or redemption prior to maturity, shall contain a recital to that effect.

SEC. 9.
Section 15832 of the Government Code is amended to read:

Upon receipt of a resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of bonds, the Treasurer shall provide for their preparation in accordance with the resolution.

For purposes of this chapter, the method for determining the lowest interest cost bid shall be determined by the Treasurer and shall be limited to either the net interest cost method or the true interest cost method determined by the bids as submitted in accordance with the notice of sale. The net interest cost of each bid shall be determined by ascertaining the total amount of interest that the state would be required to pay under that bid, from the date of the bonds to the respective maturity dates of the bonds then offered for sale, at the interest rate or rates specified in the bid, less the total amount of the premium, if any, or plus the total amount of the discount, if any, offered by the bid. The bid under which the amount ascertained is the least shall be deemed to be the bid resulting in the lowest net interest cost. Under the true interest cost method, the bonds shall be awarded to the bidder submitting the lowest interest rate bid determined by the nominal interest rate that, when compounded semiannually and used to discount the debt service payments on the bonds to the date of the bonds, results in an amount equal to the price bid for the bonds, excluding interest accrued to the date of delivery.
Temporary or interim bonds, certificates, or receipts of any denomination whatever, to be signed by the Treasurer, may be issued and delivered until the definitive bonds are executed and available for delivery. Signature of the Treasurer may be by signature stamp.

This appropriation shall be inoperative as to any facility for which jurisdiction has been transferred pursuant to Section 15816.
SEC. 11.
This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.","(1) Existing law, except as specified, prohibits any state agency from expending funds appropriated for design-build projects until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria or performance criteria and concept drawings for the project. Existing law, for these purposes, defines the term “performance criteria” to mean the information that fully describes the scope of the proposed project, as specified. Existing law, for these purposes, defines the term “concept drawings” to mean any schematic drawings or architectural renderings that are prepared, in addition to performance criteria, in the detail necessary to sufficiently describe the state’s needs.
This bill would revise the definition of “performance criteria,” for these purposes, to include concept drawings, as specified. The bill would additionally make conforming changes.
(2) Existing law establishes the State Public Works Board which consists of the Director of Finance, the Director of Transportation, and the Director of General Services. Existing law authorizes the Director of Transportation and the Director of General Services to appoint a deputy or assistant director in their respective departments to act in their place on the board, as specified.
This bill would repeal that authorization.
(3) Existing law requires the State Public Works Board to notify the Department of General Services whenever the revenues, rentals, or receipts from the operation of a public building that was acquired or constructed by the board are no longer required or pledged for the payment of principal or interest on any of the certificates or revenue bonds of the board. Existing law provides that thereafter, that public building is under the jurisdiction of, and operated and maintained by, the Department of General Services.
This bill would repeal this notification requirement and instead require those buildings to return to the jurisdiction of, and be operated and managed by, the state agency that had jurisdiction of the property prior to the board’s financing of the public building. The bill would additionally make conforming changes.
Existing law exempts from these provisions any public buildings that are acquired by lease by the board from a state agency, for the purposes of leasing the public building back to the state agency, as specified, and public buildings constructed for lease purchase to the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Maritime Academy, or any community college district. Existing law provides that when the revenues, rentals, or receipts from the operation of any public facility or public building are no longer required or pledged for the payment of principal or interest on the certificates or revenue bonds of the board, title to the public building vests in the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Maritime Academy, or the community college district.
This bill would repeal these exemption and vesting provisions.
(4) Existing law, until July 1, 2015, authorizes the State Public Works Board to acquire public buildings by lease from any state agency, and to lease those public buildings back to the state agency and pledge the revenues, rentals, or receipts to the lease to secure repayment of revenue bonds, notes, or certificates issued by the board for the purpose of facilitating the financing of public buildings, as specified.
This bill would eliminate the repeal date and require the Department of Finance to report to the Legislature by June 30, 2017, on the effects of this repeal, as specified.
(5) Existing law requires all revenue bonds issued for state building construction to bear the signature of the Governor, and the facsimile countersignature of the Controller and the Treasurer, as specified. Existing law requires all interest coupons attached to each bond to bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer, as specified. Existing law specifies that the rate of interest to be born by the bonds need not be uniform for all bonds of the same issue or series or division and provides that the rate may be determined and fixed by the State Public Works Board by resolution adopted at or after the sale of the bonds.
This bill would eliminate the requirement that all interest coupons attached to each bond bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer and all references to interest coupons in these provisions. The bill would additionally provide that a “not to exceed” interest rate may be determined and fixed by the board by resolution adopted prior to or after the sale of the bonds.
(6) Existing law requires the highest bid received on the sale of the bonds to be determined by deducting the total amount of the premium bid, if any, from the total amount of the interest that the state would be required to pay from the date of the bonds or the last preceding interest payment date, whichever is latest, to the respective maturity date of the bonds, as specified, and requires the award to be made on the basis of the lowest net interest cost to the state. Existing law requires the Treasurer, upon receipt of a resolution of the State Public Works Board authorizing the issuance of bonds, to provide for the preparation of the bonds in accordance with the resolution. In the case of a public sale, existing law authorizes the Treasurer to sell the bonds at the time, and with the notice, determined by the Treasurer, upon sealed bids, to the bidder whose bid will result in the lowest net interest cost on account of the bonds.
This bill would instead authorize the Treasurer, for a public sale, to set forth the form and means of bids, and to sell to the bidder whose bid will result in the lowest interest cost to the state on account of the bonds. The bill would set forth the procedures the Treasurer may use to determine the lowest interest cost to the state, including the net interest cost of each bid, or the true interest cost of each bid, as defined.
(7) Existing law authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, participating counties, and the State Public Works Board to acquire, design, and construct local jail facilities approved by the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC). Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the amounts of $365,771,000 and $854,229,000, in 2 phases, to finance the acquisition, design, and construction, and a reasonable construction reserve, of approved local jail facilities, as specified. Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the amount of $500,000,000 to finance the acquisition, design, and construction, and a reasonable construction reserve, of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, as defined. The funds derived from those revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes are continuously appropriated for the purposes described above.
This bill would decrease the authorization for revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the first phase from $365,771,000 to $340,866,000 and increase the authorization of the 2nd phase from $854,229,000 to $870,074,000. The bill would also increase the authorization to be used for adult local criminal justice facilities from $500,000,000 to $509,060,000.
(8) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","An act to amend Sections 13332.19, 15816, 15817.1, 15820.903, 15820.913, 15820.922, 15831, 15832, and 15848 of, and to repeal Section 15770.5 of, the Government Code, relating to public works, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

There is in the State Treasury the Annuitants’ Health Care Coverage Fund that is a trust fund and a retirement fund, within the meaning of Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
Notwithstanding
Subject to the limitation provided in subdivision (b), notwithstanding

SEC. 9.
This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.
SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","(1) The Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA), which is administered by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, governs the funding and provision of postemployment health care benefits for eligible retired public employees and their families. PEMHCA defines “family member” for these purposes. PEMHCA authorizes the board to contract with carriers offering health benefit plans and prohibits employees, annuitants, and their family members who are eligible for Medicare, as specified, from enrolling in a basic health benefit plan. PEMHCA requires the board to make certain notifications and reports to the Legislature in connection with health benefit plans offered pursuant to its provisions.
This bill would clarify the definition of family for the purposes of PEMHCA by specifically excluding former spouses and former domestic partners. The bill would require the employing office, as specified, of a state employee or state annuitant, pursuant to standards established by the Department of Human Resources, to possess documentation verifying eligibility of an employee’s family member prior to the enrollment of a family member in a health benefit plan and to verify continued eligibility pursuant to a specified schedule. The bill would prohibit the board from granting further exceptions to the rule against enrolling in employees, annuitants, and their family members who are eligible for Medicare, as specified, in a basic health benefit plan. The bill would revise the entities to which the board is required to provide notification of approval of proposed benefit and premium readjustments to exclude the Legislature as a whole and to instead require provision of an initial estimate of proposed changes in writing to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, the chairpersons of the committees and subcommittees in each house of the Legislature that consider the Public Employees’ Retirement System’s budget and activities, the State Controller, the Director of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst. The bill would specify the latest date that this notification may take place. The bill would require the board to provide a specified, detailed report to the Legislature and the Director of Finance annually, on November 1, regarding the health benefit plans it provides.
(2) PEMHCA establishes the Annuitants’ Health Care Coverage Fund, which is continuously appropriated for the purpose of prefunding of health care coverage for annuitants, including administrative costs. PEMHCA defines “prefunding” for these purposes.
This bill would prohibit the use of certain state funds in the Annuitants’ Health Care Coverage Fund for the payment of benefits until the earlier of 2 specified dates. The bill would revise the definition of prefunding to include employee as well as employer payments and to provide that payments may fund the actuarially determined normal costs of postemployment health care benefits. By providing a new funding source for a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
(3) Existing law prescribes the duties of the Controller, which generally regard supervision of the fiscal concerns of the state. Existing law requires the Controller to abolish a state position that is vacant for 6 consecutive monthly pay periods on the following July 1, and permits the Director of Finance to authorize reestablishment of a position abolished pursuant to this authority under certain conditions. Among other things, existing law requires the Controller to reestablish a position abolished pursuant to this authority if the director of the department in which that position existed prior to abolishment makes a certification by August 15, as specified.
This bill would repeal the provisions pertaining to vacant positions described above.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","An act relating to the Budget Act of 2015.
An act to amend Sections 22775, 22781, 22844, 22865, 22866, and 22940 of, to add Section 22843.1 to, and to repeal Section 12439 of, the Government Code, relating to state government, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

SEC. 16.
This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.","(1) The California Constitution provides that the civil service includes every officer and employee in the state except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, and existing statutory law, the State Civil Service Act, prescribes a comprehensive civil service personnel system for the state. The act grants eligibility for promotional civil service examinations and career executive assignment examinations to persons who meet certain requirements and minimum qualifications and who are employed by the Legislature, persons who are retired from the United States armed forces, honorably discharged from active military duty with a service-connected disability, or honorably discharged from active duty, or persons who were employees of the executive branch in exempt positions.
This bill would revise eligibility standards applicable to people who were employed by the Legislature, people who retired or were discharged from the armed forces, and people who were formerly employed in exempt, executive branch positions, as described above, to permit them, upon request, to obtain civil service appointment list eligibility by taking promotional exams or career executive exams for which they meet minimum qualifications, as specified. The bill would eliminate the requirement that an employee or veteran, in this context, select only one promotional examination in which to compete when multiple examinations are given. Among other things, the bill would also remove a time limit on this eligibility granted to specified former employees of the Legislature and employees of the executive branch in exempt positions.
(2) Existing law generally requires that appointments to vacant positions be made by lists. Existing law requires, with specified exceptions, that an appointing power receive the names and addresses of the three persons highest on a promotional employment list for the class in which a position belongs, and if there are fewer than three names, as specified, additional names are provided from the various lists next lower in order of preference. Existing law prescribes requirements for providing names to an appointing power for positions designated as management and specifies a method of ranking eligible candidates in this context. Existing law prescribes requirements for providing names to an appointing power for positions designated as supervisory and not professional, scientific, or administrative, and that are not examined for on an open basis, and specifies a method of ranking eligible candidates in this context. Existing law requires an appointing power to fill a position from the names of the persons provided.
This bill would repeal these provisions and make conforming changes.
(3) Existing law provides for career executive assignments to encourage the development for well-qualified executives and requires the State Personnel Board to establish, by a rule, a system of merit personnel administration specifically suited to the selection and placement of executive personnel. The State Civil Service Act defines career executive. Existing law requires the State Personnel Board, by rule, to provide that employees whose appointments to career executive assignments are terminated to be reinstated to civil service positions, as specified, at their option.
This bill would revise the definition of career executive to eliminate the requirement that the person have permanent status in the civil service. This bill would provide that various provisions relating to personnel examinations don’t apply to career executive assignments unless provided for by rule, as specified. The bill would grant reinstatement rights to employees who at the time of appointment to a career executive assignment were not employed by the state but who had previously worked for it and had gained permanent civil service status. The bill would grant an employee who at the time of his or her appointment to a career executive assignment
did not have
was from outside
civil service
status eligibility to compete in any promotional examination for which he or she meets the minimum qualifications as prescribed by the class specification, except as specified, and would provide these employees other rights in this context, including
the right to defer
examinations and to transfer list eligibility in the same manner as civil service employees.
examination for any open eligible list, as specified, in existence at the time of the termination of the career executive assignment for which he or she meets the minimum qualifications of the class to which appointment is sought. The bill would require, in this regard, that related experience gained in a career executive assignment be considered state civil service experience in a comparable class, as specified.
The bill would make an appropriation from the General Fund of $300,000 to the Department of Finance for the purpose of funding the posting on the department’s Internet Web site of all budget requests included as part of the Governor’s Budget.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","An act to amend Sections 18546, 18990, 18991, 18992, 18993, 19057.1, 19057.3, 19889, 19889.2, and 19889.3 of, to add Section 19889.4 to, and to repeal Sections 19057, 19057.2, and 19057.4 of, the Government Code, relating to state civil service, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

(2)
The reforms included in the framework endorsed by the Regents will create capacity for all campuses of the university to serve more resident students, including by easing transfer from the community colleges, reducing the amount of time it takes students to complete programs, and using technology and data to improve allocation of available resources.
(3)
In addition to the funds included in this appropriation and those described in the framework, other funds, including existing resources that can be redirected to higher priorities, such as those currently being used to provide financial aid to nonresident students, are also available to enable more resident students to enter the university at all of its campuses.
(4)
Furthermore, it is the intent of the Legislature that those funds generated by an increase in the number of nonresident students enrolled in the 2015–16 academic year, compared to the number of nonresident students enrolled in the 2014–15 academic year, and increases in nonresident supplemental tuition, as approved by the Regents on May 21, 2015, be used specifically to support an increase in the number of resident students enrolled.

To address immediate needs, the university is expected to enroll, no later than the 2016–17 academic year, at least 5,000 more resident undergraduate students than the number enrolled in the 2014–15 academic year.
(c)
If the Regents provide sufficient evidence to the Director of Finance on or before May 1, 2016, to demonstrate that the university will satisfy the expectation enumerated in subdivision (b), the Director of Finance shall increase this appropriation by $25,000,000 and notify the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.

434,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Educators and policymakers have long acknowledged that the skills and competencies needed to be an effective teacher are supported through early and structured mentoring and assessment.
(b) Induction programs help beginning teachers transition into the profession by providing standards-based, individualized assistance that combines the application of theory with intensive mentor-based support and formative assessment.
(c) In 1998, California created its two-tiered teaching credential system and established the completion of a statewide, standards-based induction program, Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA), as a path toward a clear credential.
(d) Until 2009, the state provided $4,000 per participating teacher to BTSA providers as part of the Teacher Credentialing Block Grant.
(e) In order to receive state funding, a local educational agency (LEA) was required to make a local in-kind contribution of $2,000 per participating teacher.
(f) The combined level of dedicated funding was sufficient for running the program and allowed LEAs to provide induction at no charge to beginning teachers.
(g) In 2009, due to the Great Recession, the state gave increased flexibility to LEAs by allowing Teacher Credentialing Block Grant funds to be used for any educational purpose.
(h) In 2013, the state eliminated the majority of K–12 categorical programs, including the Teacher Credentialing Block Grant, with the establishment of the local control funding formula (LCFF).
(i) Although former Teacher Credentialing Block Grant funds are included in LEAs’ base LCFF funding, some induction providers have shifted the costs of induction onto teacher participants, while others have closed their programs altogether.
(j) According to data collected by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, nearly 12 percent of providers are charging teachers an average of $2,000 per year for induction.
(k) The large fees place heavy financial burdens on teachers just starting their careers and put the entire responsibility of identifying, accessing, and completing a quality induction program solely on new teachers.
(l) A new teacher’s inability to access an induction program compromises that teacher’s professional growth and greatly reduces the chance that the teacher will stay in the profession.
(m) This is particularly troubling because enrollment in teacher preparation programs, and the number of new teaching credentials being issued, have reduced considerably in recent years.
(n) In 2013, according to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, there were fewer than 20,000 students enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state, less than half of the number that were enrolled in 2008.
(o) The shortage is expected to worsen within the next 20 years with projected increases in student enrollment and teacher retirements.
(p) Access to high quality induction programs is critical to addressing the teacher shortage because induction is an important tool for recruiting and retaining teachers.
(q) Teacher retention data collected by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of induction, showing that 87 percent of teachers who participated in a BTSA program were still teaching five years later.
(r) The Governor and Legislature recognized induction’s importance by including $490 million in the 2015–16 Budget Act for activities that promote educator quality and effectiveness, including support and mentoring for both beginning teachers and administrators.
(s) The 2015–16 Budget Act also directs the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, by September 1, 2015, to work with stakeholders to evaluate any burdens of existing induction requirements and identify funding recommendations, including state, LEA, and teacher candidate responsibilities.
(t) The allocation and forthcoming report by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing provide a great opportunity to protect and support new teachers by strengthening access and the quality of induction programs.

It is the intent of the Legislature that the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) be applied only to persons who enter a program of professional preparation on or after January 1, 1997.","Existing law prescribes the minimum requirements for a clear multiple or single subject teaching credential, including the completion of either a beginning teacher induction program approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to the Marian Bergeson Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment System, an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is provided by one or more local educational agencies and has been approved by the commission and the Superintendent on the basis of initial review and periodic evaluations of the program in relation to appropriate standards of credential program quality and effectiveness that have been adopted by the commission, the Superintendent, and the State Board of Education, as provided, or an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is sponsored by a regionally accredited college or university, in cooperation with one or more local school districts, that addresses the individual professional needs of beginning teachers and meets the commission’s standards of induction, except as provided. Existing law also requires credentials for teaching specialties, including, but not limited to, bilingual education, early childhood education, and special education, to be based upon a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution, completion of a program of professional preparation, and any other standards which the commission may establish.
This bill would, commencing with hiring for the 2016–17 school year, and each school year thereafter, prohibit a school district, county office of education, or charter school from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in a beginning teacher induction program that is approved by the commission and the Superintendent, and would define a beginning teacher for purposes of that provision to include a teacher with a preliminary multiple or single subject teaching credential, or a preliminary education specialist credential. The bill also would prohibit a local educational agency from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in an alternative program of beginning teacher induction program that it provides, and would prohibit a school district from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is sponsored by a regionally accredited college or university, in cooperation with one or more local school districts.","An act to amend Section 44259 of the Education Code, relating to teacher credentialing."

This subdivision shall not apply to, and shall not in any way affect, Amador Water Agency’s water rights application 5647X03 pending before the State Water Resources Control Board.
(g) (1) The secretary shall develop a cost estimate of the study and report required by subdivision (c) and enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority. The cost-sharing agreement shall require that the state pay not more than 50 percent of the cost of the study and report required by subdivision (c), with the remaining cost to be paid by the authority. The payment by the authority may consist of appropriated funds or a contribution of services.
(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude any private donations or contributions from interested parties to be used for the purposes of this subdivision.

SEC. 4.
Section 5093.56 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:
5093.56.
No department or agency of the state may assist or cooperate, whether by loan, grant, license, or otherwise, with any department or agency of the federal, state, or local government, in the planning or construction of a dam, reservoir, diversion, or other water impoundment facility that could have an adverse effect on the free-flowing condition and natural character of either of the following:
(a) The rivers and segments thereof designated in Section 5093.54 as included in the system.
(b) The segments of the Mokelumne River designated in Section 5093.549 for study by the secretary as potential additions to the system until after the study period and implementation of any recommendations have been completed, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first. This subdivision shall not apply to, and shall not in any way affect, Amador Water Agency’s water rights application 5647X03 pending before the State Water Resources Control Board, or prejudice, alter, affect in any way, or interfere with the maintenance, repair, or operation by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company of the Mokelumne River Project (FERC 137) currently under the 2001 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for the project, the incorporated settlement agreement, any license amendments made with the agreement of the parties to the incorporated settlement agreement, and any adjustment of flows permitted to occur pursuant to the license for enhancement of ecological resources.
SEC. 5.
Due to the unique geographical features of the Mokelumne River and its tributaries, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that a special law is necessary and a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution.
SEC. 6.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district are the result of a program for which legislative authority was requested by that local agency or school district, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code and Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law, the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, provides for a system of classification of those rivers or segments of rivers in the state that are designated as wild, scenic, or recreational rivers, for purposes of preserving the highest and most beneficial use of those rivers. The act requires the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to study and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report that analyzes the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of rivers or segments of rivers that are designated by the Legislature as potential additions to the system, and requires that each report contain specified information and recommendations with respect to the proposed designation.
This bill would require the secretary, in a report analyzing the suitability or nonsuitability of a proposed designation of the Mokelumne River, its tributaries, or segments thereof as additions to the system, to consider the potential effects of the proposed designation on future water requirements, as specified, and the effects of climate change on river values and current and projected water supplies, and to consider other factors. The bill would include any segment of the Mokelumne River designated for potential addition within certain protections afforded to wild and scenic rivers until the completion of the study period and the implementation of any recommendation to add the segment of the Mokelumne River to the system, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first.
The bill would also designate specified segments of the Mokelumne River for potential addition to the system. The bill would require the secretary to submit a report pursuant to the above-described requirements to the Legislature and Governor no later than December 31, 2017, and would require the report to include a clear recommendation on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of each of the designated segments of the Mokelumne River. The bill would require the secretary to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority that would require the state and the authority to each pay a specified portion of the cost of the report. By imposing new duties on a local government entity, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The bill would declare that due to the unique geographical features of the Mokelumne River and its tributaries, a general statute within the meaning of specified provisions of the California Constitution cannot be made applicable and a special statute is necessary.
(3)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 5093.56 of, and to add Sections 5093.548 and 5093.549 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to wild and scenic rivers."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, establishes uniform health and sanitation standards for retail food facilities, as defined. Existing law exempts from the definition of food facility premises set aside for wine tasting, regardless of whether there is a charge for the wine tasting, if no other beverage, except for bottles of wine and prepackaged nonpotentially hazardous beverages, is offered for sale for onsite consumption and no food, except for crackers, is served. Existing law prohibits certain premises from having a food display area that exceeds 25 square feet, and subjects certain facilities or premises with a food display area of 25 square feet or less to specified provisions of the code. Existing law imposes certain enforcement duties on the State Department of Public Health, but provides that local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing these provisions. A person who violates any provision of the code is guilty of a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided.
This bill would additionally exclude from the definition of food facility a premises set aside for wine tasting that offers pretzels or prepackaged nonpotentially hazardous food for sale or for onsite consumption. The bill would limit the food display area in premises set aside for wine tasting to 25 square feet and subject those premises to specified provisions of the California Retail Food Code. By imposing new duties on local health agencies, and by expanding the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, for the purposes of the California Retail Food Code, defines “community event” to mean an event that is of a civic, political, public, or educational nature.
This bill would limit the definition of a community event to include only an event of a civic, political, public, or educational nature conducted for not more than 25 consecutive or nonconsecutive days in a 90-day period.
Under existing law, a permanent food facility is required to provide clean toilet facilities in good repair for consumers, guests, and invitees, except that a building constructed before January 1, 2004, that has a food facility that provides space for the consumption of food on the premises may either provide clean toilet facilities in good repair or prominently post a sign in a public area stating that toilet facilities are not provided.
This bill would limit the above exemption to food facilities that have been in continuous operation since January 1, 2004.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Sections 113755, 113789, 114276, and 114289 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to food facilities."

(c) A person violating subdivision (a) or (b) is guilty of an infraction. Each day that waste placed, deposited, or dumped in violation of subdivision (a) or (b) remains unabated is a separate violation.
(d) This section does not restrict a private owner in the use of his or her own private property, unless the placing, depositing, or dumping of the waste matter on the property creates a public health and safety hazard, a public nuisance, or a fire hazard, as determined by a local health department, local fire department or district providing fire protection services, or the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, in which case this section applies.
(e) A person convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) shall be punished by a mandatory fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon a first conviction, by a mandatory fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) upon a second conviction, and by a mandatory fine of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) upon a third or subsequent conviction. If the court finds that the waste matter placed, deposited, or dumped was used tires, the fine prescribed in this subdivision shall be doubled.
(f) The court may require, in addition to any fine imposed upon a conviction, that, as a condition of probation and in addition to any other condition of probation, a person convicted under this section remove, or pay the cost of removing, any waste matter which the convicted person dumped or caused to be dumped upon public or private property.
(g) Except when the court requires the convicted person to remove waste matter which he or she is responsible for dumping as a condition of probation, the court may, in addition to the fine imposed upon a conviction, require as a condition of probation, in addition to any other condition of probation, that a person convicted of a violation of this section pick up waste matter at a time and place within the jurisdiction of the court for not less than 12 hours.
(h) (1) A person who places, deposits, or dumps, or causes to be placed, deposited, or dumped, waste matter in violation of this section in commercial quantities shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months and by a fine. The fine is mandatory and shall amount to not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) upon a first conviction, not less than three thousand dollars ($3,000) nor more than six thousand dollars ($6,000) upon a second conviction, and not less than six thousand dollars ($6,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) upon a third or subsequent conviction.
(2) “Commercial quantities” means an amount of waste matter generated in the course of a trade, business, profession, or occupation, or an amount equal to or in excess of one cubic yard. This subdivision does not apply to the dumping of household waste at a person’s residence.
(i) (1) A person who places, deposits, or dumps, or causes to be placed, deposited, or dumped, waste matter upon private property, including on any private highway or road, without the consent of the owner shall be punished by a fine. The fine is mandatory and shall amount to not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon a first conviction, not less than five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) upon a second conviction, and not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) upon a third conviction. Upon a fourth or subsequent conviction, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 30 days and by a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000).
(2)  If the court finds that the waste matter placed, deposited, or dumped includes used tires, the fine prescribed in this subdivision shall be doubled. A separate fine in the same amount as initially imposed shall accrue for each day that waste placed, deposited, or dumped remains unabated, but no additional conviction for the purposes of punishments in paragraph (1) shall arise for the same act. For the fourth or subsequent violation, each day that waste placed, deposited, or dumped remains shall not result in the accrual of a separate fine or violation for the purposes of punishments in paragraph (1).
(j) For purposes of this section, “person” means an individual, trust, firm, partnership, joint stock company, joint venture, or corporation.
(k) Except in unusual cases where the interests of justice would be best served by waiving or reducing a fine, the minimum fines provided by this section shall not be waived or reduced.

A violation of these provisions is an infraction punishable by a fine between $250 and $1,000 for a first conviction, between $500 and $1,500 for a 2nd conviction, and between $750 and $3,000 for a 3rd or subsequent conviction.
This bill would make dumping waste matter on private property, including on any private road or highways, without the consent of the owner punishable by a fine between $250 and $1,000 for a first conviction, between $500 and $1,500 for a 2nd conviction, and between $750 and $3,000 for a 3rd conviction. The bill would make a 4th or subsequent conviction a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 30 days and by a fine of not less than $750 nor more than $3,000.

The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider’s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that a patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device.","An act to add Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 111548) to Chapter 6 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to drugs and devices."

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the California Control of Profits of Organized Crime Act, provides the procedure for the forfeiture of property and proceeds acquired through a pattern of criminal profiteering activity, as specified, and requires the prosecution to file a petition for forfeiture in conjunction with certain criminal charges. Under existing law, criminal profiteering activity is defined to include specified crimes, including forgery and offenses relating to counterfeit of a registered mark. Existing law also defines organized crime for the purposes of these provisions as including, among other things, specified crimes that are of a conspiratorial nature and are either of an organized nature and seek to supply illegal goods and services or crimes that, through planning and coordination of individual efforts, seek to conduct specified illegal activities.
This bill would include within the definition of criminal profiteering activity offenses relating to piracy, and insurance fraud, as specified. The bill would also broaden the definition of organized crime to include pimping and pandering, counterfeiting of a registered mark, piracy of a recording or audiovisual work, embezzlement, securities fraud, grand theft, money laundering, and forgery. By increasing the burdens on local prosecuting agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Sales and Use Tax Law, imposes a tax on retailers measured by the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state, or on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. Existing law provides that a “retail sale” or “sale at retail” includes any sale by a convicted seller, as defined, of tangible personal property with a counterfeit mark on, or in connection with, that sale, regardless of whether the sale is for resale in the regular course of business. Existing law provides that “storage” or “use” includes a purchase by a convicted purchaser, as defined, of tangible personal property with a counterfeit mark on, or in connection with, that purchase, regardless of whether the purchase is for resale in the regular course of business.
Under this bill, a “retail sale” or “sale at retail” additionally would include any sale by a convicted seller of tangible personal property with a counterfeit label or an illicit label, as specified. The bill similarly would provide that “storage” and “use” additionally would include a purchase by a convicted purchaser of tangible personal property with a counterfeit label or an illicit label, as specified.
The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.
The amendments made by this bill would be incorporated into these laws.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3
of the membership of each house of the Legislature.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 186.2 of the Penal Code, and to amend Sections 6007 and 6009.2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to criminal profiteering."

The Legislature further finds and declares that it is an efficient and reasonable use of state funds to increase the annual budget for county veterans service officers in an amount not to exceed eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) if it is justified by the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the effort of these officers.
(2)It is the intent of the Legislature, after reviewing the department’s determination in subdivision (c), to consider an increase in the annual budget for county veterans service officers in an amount not to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000), if the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the assistance of county veteran service officers justify that increase in the budget.

972.1.
(a) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall, no later than July 1, 2016, develop an allocation formula based upon performance standards that encourage innovation and reward outstanding service by county veterans service officers. Upon appropriation by the Legislature of moneys for this purpose, the moneys shall be allocated each fiscal year in accordance with that formula among only those counties that, in the discretion of the secretary, comply with the following requirements:
(1) Establish and maintain a county veterans service officer, pursuant to Section 970.
(2) Collect and report all information required by the department in accordance with departmental regulations.
(3) Comply with the training and accreditation standards for county veterans service officers and veteran service representatives as may be set by the department.
(4) Require county veterans service officers and veteran service representatives to become accredited with the department for the purpose of providing representation services to claimants before the United States Department of Veterans Affairs within 18 months of the commencement of his or her employment, or on or before June 1, 2017, whichever date is later.
(b) The department shall annually report to the Legislature the efficacy, return on investment, work volume, and regional impact of the subvention funds on each county that receives those funds. The department shall, in addition to the requirements of Section 974, annually determine information including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) The amount of new or increased monetary benefits paid to eligible veterans by the federal government attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers and the basis for that determination.
(2) The amount paid to each county, including the amounts paid to each county for each category of workload unit included in the allocation formula.
(3) An evaluation as to each county’s use of subvention funds, including recommendations for improvement of each county’s use of subvention funds.
(c) The department shall, on or before October 1 of each year, prepare and transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The Department of Finance shall review the department’s determination in time to use the information in the annual Budget Act for the budget of the department for the next fiscal year. The department may combine this report with the report required by Section 974.
(d) For the purposes of this section, “workload unit” means a specific claim activity that is used to allocate subvention funds to counties, which is approved by the department, and performed by county veterans service officers.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department revise the allocation formula pursuant to this section on a regular basis to adjust for changes in veteran demographics and veteran needs.
SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are creating an entirely new generation of veterans who may be eligible for federal veterans benefits because of their war service and their physical and mental conditions.
(b)Californians make up to 10 percent of the federal military forces used in these conflicts. Furthermore, the California National Guard and California-based reserve units have contributed significantly to these current conflicts.
(c)Many of these returning California veterans are not aware of the federal and state benefits that are available to them.
(d)Additionally, it is estimated that in California there may be over two million veterans, and their widows or widowers, who are unaware that they may be eligible for pensions from the federal government based upon their, or their spouses’, past military service in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, or the Gulf War.
(e)California’s county veterans service officers are the initial local point of contact for claimants accessing the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
(f)The costs of maintaining county veterans service officers are shared from county general funds and state reimbursement to the counties. In 1997, in order to track performance, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Senate Bill 608, enacted as Chapter 318 of the Statutes of 1997, which required the California Department of Veterans Affairs to annually report the amount of monetary benefits paid to veterans by the federal government that were attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers. Senate Bill 608 also required the Department of Finance to consider an increase in the annual budget for county veterans service officers of up to $5 million, if approved in the annual budget process. In 2009, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Senate Bill 419 enacted as Chapter 183 of the Statutes of 2009, which raised this amount to $11 million, if approved in the annual budget process.
(g)As a result of this annual reporting, by the end of 2013, it had been determined that from 1995 to 2013, inclusive, the state had cumulatively budgeted $41.4 million for its share of the cost of the county veterans service officers. As a result of this investment, county veteran service officers were able to assist local veterans in obtaining $4.1 billion, in new federal moneys. This is a return of about $98 for every $1 the state allocates to county veterans service officers. Furthermore, the $4.1 billion only reflects the actual monetary benefits qualified for in a given year. The monetary benefits qualified for in prior years are not tracked, yet the veterans and their dependents may continue to receive those benefits for the rest of their lives. Added to this stellar return on the state’s investment, but not counted in the annual reporting, are the Medi-Cal cost avoidance savings incurred as a result of county veterans service officers qualifying and shifting veterans away from Medi-Cal and into the appropriate federal veterans program.
(h)The county veterans service officers had accomplished all of this without ever reaching the allowable state budget allocation of $11 million, set in 2009. To date, the county veterans service officers have not received more than $5.6 million per year from the state.
(i)It is critical that the county veterans service officers receive a steady stream of funding because there continues to be a large number of underserved veterans and their dependents who are not aware of the federal benefits available to them as a result of their military service. Studies from other states have shown that increases in county veterans service officers have resulted in larger amounts of federal moneys to veterans. These new federal moneys and benefits are paid directly from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to the qualifying veteran or their dependent and are used in the local economy.

(2)For the purposes of this subdivision, the department, by June 30, 2013, shall develop a performance-based formula that will incentivize county veterans service officers to perform workload units that help veterans access federal compensation and pension benefits and other benefits, in order to maximize the amount of federal money received by California veterans.
(b)The department shall annually determine the amount of new or increased monetary benefits paid to eligible veterans by the federal government attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers. The department shall, on or before October 1 of each year, prepare and transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The Department of Finance shall review the department’s determination in time to use the information in the annual Budget Act for the budget of the department for the next fiscal year.
(c)The department shall conduct a review of the high-performing and low-performing county veterans service officers, and, based on this review, shall produce a best-practices manual for county veterans service officers by June 30, 2013.
(d)The Legislature finds and declares that it is an efficient and reasonable use of state funds to increase the annual budget for county veterans service officers up to a total of eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) if it is justified by the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the effort of these officers.

443,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides millions of previously uninsured Californians access to health services, including physician care. As a result of this additional demand for physician services, the projected statewide physician shortfall is 17,000 for 2015.
(b) The San Joaquin Valley, which runs from Stockton to Bakersfield, is rich in cultural diversity and is the nation’s leading agricultural region. However, the valley is disproportionately affected by the state’s physician shortage, which is expected to intensify in the years ahead given the high rate of population growth in the area. Access to health care is 31 percent lower in the San Joaquin Valley than in the rest of California.
(c) Several regions of the San Joaquin Valley are federally designated Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs). The calculation of MUAs involves four variables: the ratio of primary medical care physicians per 1,000 population, the infant mortality rate, the percentage of the population with incomes below the poverty level, and the percentage of the population 65 years of age or over.
(d) To help address California’s physician workforce needs, the Regents of the University of California engaged in a comprehensive strategic planning process and, in May 2008, approved moving forward with planning efforts leading to the development of a possible medical school at the campus of the University of California, Merced (UC Merced). At that time, the regents also approved moving forward with other preparations, such as planning for the initial basic sciences and clinical infrastructure. Upon completion of these and other activities, the regents envisioned that a formal proposal to establish a new medical school eventually could be developed.
(e) The medical schools of the University of California, including a possible future medical school at UC Merced, will play an important role in addressing California’s physician shortages.
(f) Medical education and a possible future UC Merced School of Medicine will further contribute to the economic growth of the San Joaquin Valley and the state, as well as expand educational opportunities for valley residents, and will further support UC Merced’s trajectory toward becoming a top-tier university.
(g) UC Merced’s San Joaquin Valley Program in Medical Education (PRIME) is providing a key interim resource for training valley health care providers. This program accomplishes all of the following:
(1) Strengthens the desire for new physicians to practice in the San Joaquin Valley, which is one of California’s most medically underserved areas.
(2) Reduces health disparities and inequalities in the San Joaquin Valley.
(3) Forms lasting relationships between the program and communities, hospitals, clinics, and physicians to enhance health care in the region.
(h) Students who take part in PRIME benefit from firsthand experience with interdisciplinary health care by providing care in medically underserved communities, working with patients and families from culturally diverse backgrounds, and developing a true understanding of the issues and conditions that impact access to and quality of health care in the region.
(i) Despite its numerous benefits for its region, PRIME lacks an ongoing source of funding for its current enrollment as well as the financial resources to expand capacity to meet the needs of the valley.
(j) Given the San Joaquin Valley’s health care needs and the critical role that a possible future medical school at UC Merced would play in addressing those needs, it is essential for the State of California to continue developing the valley’s health care resources by sustaining the current PRIME enrollment, expanding that program’s capacity, and continuing to move toward the establishment of a medical school at UC Merced.

Existing law requires specified agencies to use additional separate collection categories and other tabulations for major Asian groups and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander groups, and also requires those agencies to take additional actions, including, among other things, posting, and annually updating, the demographic data collected on their Internet Web sites, and updating the reporting categories to reflect these Asian and Pacific Islander groups as they are reported for the 2020 decennial census.
This bill would require the updating of the reporting categories for future decennial censuses. The bill would require, on or after July 1, 2016, the Department of Managed Health Care to use the additional separate collection categories and other tabulations for specified Asian groups and Pacific Islander groups, and to take additional actions as specified above, under certain circumstances.
This bill would, on and after July 1, 2016, require the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Trustees of the California State University, and the Regents of the University of California, whenever those entities collect demographic data as to the ancestry or ethnic origin of students for a report that includes student admission, enrollment, completion, or graduation rates, to use specified collection and tabulation categories for Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups, as specified. The bill would require each entity specified above to make this demographic data publicly available by posting the data on the applicable entity’s Internet Web site and would require the updating of the reporting categories for each decennial census. The bill would not apply these categorization requirements to demographic data of graduate and professional schools of the University of California. The bill would be applicable to the University of California only if the Regents of the University of California, by resolution, make it applicable.
To the extent the bill would impose additional requirements on community colleges, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the State, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 66027.1 to the Education Code, and to amend Section 8310.7 of the Government Code, relating to data collection."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that the purpose of this act is to address ongoing vote dilution and discrimination in voting as matters of statewide concern, in order to enforce the fundamental rights guaranteed to California voters under Section 7 of Article I and Section 2 of Article II of the California Constitution. Therefore, the provisions of this act shall be construed liberally in furtherance of this legislative intent to eliminate minority vote dilution. It is the further intent of the Legislature that any remedy implemented under this act shall comply with the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Legislature also finds and declares that this act is consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660.

The heading of Article 2 (commencing with Section 14027) is added to Chapter 1.5 of Division 14 of the Elections Code, to read:
Article  2. At-Large Elections
SEC. 4.
Article 3 (commencing with Section 14040) is added to Chapter 1.5 of Division 14 of the Elections Code, to read:
Article  3. District-Based Elections
14040.
District-based elections shall not be imposed or applied in a manner that impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class.
14041.
(a) A violation of Section 14040 is established if it is shown that racially polarized voting occurs in elections for members of the governing body of the political subdivision or in elections incorporating other electoral choices by the voters of the political subdivision. Elections conducted prior to the filing of an action pursuant to Section 14040 and this section are more probative to establish the existence of racially polarized voting than elections conducted after the filing of the action.
(b) The occurrence of racially polarized voting shall be determined from examining results of elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class or elections involving ballot measures, or other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class. One circumstance that may be considered in determining a violation of Section 14040 and this section is the extent to which candidates who are members of a protected class and who are preferred by voters of the protected class, as determined by an analysis of voting behavior, have been elected to the governing body of a political subdivision that is the subject of an action based on Section 14040 and this section.
(c) The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated does not preclude a finding of racially polarized voting, or a violation of Section 14040 and this section, but may be a factor in determining an appropriate remedy.
(d) Proof of an intent on the part of the voters or elected officials to discriminate against a protected class is not required.
(e) Other factors such as the history of discrimination, the use of electoral devices or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the dilutive effects of the election system, denial of access to those processes determining which groups of candidates will receive financial or other support in a given election, the extent to which members of a protected class bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process, and the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns are probative, but not necessary factors, to establish a violation of Section 14040 and this section.
(f) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the fact that a district-based election was imposed on the political subdivision as a result of an action filed pursuant to Article 2 shall not be a defense to an action alleging a violation of this article.
(2) (A) If a court orders a political subdivision to adopt, and subsequently approves, a district-based election system as a result of an action filed pursuant to Article 2, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in any subsequent action filed pursuant to this article that the district-based election system of that political subdivision does not violate this article. The presumption shall apply only to the exact district-based election system that was approved by the court and shall not apply if the boundaries of the districts of the political subdivision are subsequently adjusted for any reason.
(B) This paragraph shall apply only to a district-based election system that is approved by a court on or after January 1, 2016.
14042.
(a) Upon a finding of a violation of Sections 14040 and 14041, the court shall implement an effective district-based elections system that provides the protected class the opportunity to elect candidates of its choice from single-member districts.
(b) If additional effective districts under subdivision (a) are not possible without increasing the size of the governing body, or will not alone provide an appropriate remedy, the court may order additional remedies, including any of the following:
(1) Incrementally increasing the size of the governing body upon approval of voters in the jurisdiction.
(2) Approving a single-member district-based election system that provides the protected class the opportunity to join in a coalition of two or more protected classes to elect candidates of their choice if there is demonstrated political cohesion among the protected classes.
(3) Requiring elections of the governing body to be held on the same day as a statewide election, as provided in Section 1001, taking into account in any such remedial determination the capacity of the county to consolidate the election date with statewide elections.
(4) Issuing an injunction to delay an election.
14043.
In any action to enforce Sections 14040 and 14041, the court shall allow the prevailing plaintiff party, other than the state or political subdivision thereof, a reasonable attorney’s fee consistent with the standards established in Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48-49, and litigation expenses including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and expenses as part of the costs. Prevailing defendant parties shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.
14044.
Any voter who is a member of a protected class and who resides in a political subdivision where a violation of Sections 14040 and 14041 is alleged may file an action pursuant to those sections in the superior court of the county in which the political subdivision is located.
14045.
If any provision of this article or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, Articles 1, 2 and the remainder of this article, or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected.","Existing law, the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA), prohibits the use of an at-large election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice or otherwise influence the outcome of an election. The CVRA provides that a voter who is a member of a protected class may bring an action in superior court to enforce the provisions of the CVRA, and, if the voter prevails in the case, he or she may be awarded reasonable litigation costs and attorney’s fees. The CVRA requires a court to implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of district-based elections, that are tailored to remedy a violation of the act.
This bill would prohibit the use of a district-based election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice. The bill would require a court to implement specified remedies upon a finding that a district-based election was imposed or applied in a manner that impaired the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice.","An act to add the heading of Article 1 (commencing with Section 14025) and the heading of Article 2 (commencing with Section 14027) to, and to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 14040) to, Chapter 1.5 of Division 14 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

5350.2.
Reasonable attempts shall be made by the county mental health program to notify family members, or any other person designated to receive notice by the person for whom conservatorship is sought, of the time and place of the conservatorship hearing. The person for whom the conservatorship is sought shall be advised by the facility treating the person, or by the court in a proceeding under the Probate Code if the conservatorship investigation order was made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 5352, that he or she may request that information about the time and place of the conservatorship hearing not be given to family members if the proposed conservator is not a family member. The request shall be honored by the mental health program. Neither this section nor Section 5350 shall be interpreted to allow the proposed conservatee to request that any proposed conservator not be advised of the time and place of the conservatorship hearing.
SEC. 2.
Section 5352 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5352.
(a) If the professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment determines that a person in his or her care is gravely disabled as a result of mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism and is unwilling to accept, or incapable of accepting, treatment voluntarily, he or she may recommend conservatorship of the person to the officer providing conservatorship investigation of the person’s county of residence before admitting the person as a patient in the facility.
(b) The professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment may recommend conservatorship for a person without the person being an inpatient in the facility if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) The professional person or another professional person designated by him or her has examined and evaluated the person and determined that the person is gravely disabled.
(2) The professional person or another professional person designated by him or her has determined that future examination on an inpatient basis is not necessary for a determination that the person is gravely disabled.
(c) (1) If a conservatorship has already been established under the Probate Code, the court, in a proceeding under the Probate Code, after an evidentiary hearing attended by the conservatee, unless the conservatee waives presence, and the conservatee’s counsel, may order an investigation from the officer providing conservatorship investigation of the person’s county of residence if the court, in a proceeding under the Probate Code, in consultation with a licensed physician or licensed psychologist satisfying the conditions of subdivision (c) of Section 2032.020 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing comprehensive evaluation or intensive treatment, determines based on evidence presented to the court, including medical evidence, that the conservatee may be gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism and is unwilling to accept or is incapable of accepting treatment voluntarily. If the conservatee cannot afford counsel, the court, in a proceeding under the Probate Code, shall appoint counsel for him or her.
(2) The officer providing conservatorship investigation shall file a copy of his or her report with the court making the conservatorship investigation order in a proceeding under the Probate Code.
(d) If the officer providing conservatorship investigation concurs with the recommendation of the professional person, pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), or the conservatorship investigation order of the court, pursuant to subdivision (c), he or she shall petition the superior court in the patient’s county of residence to establish conservatorship.
(e) If temporary conservatorship is indicated, that fact shall be alternatively pleaded in the petition. The officer providing conservatorship investigation or other county officer or employee designated by the county shall act as the temporary conservator.

Section 5354 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5354.
(a) The officer providing conservatorship investigation shall investigate all available alternatives to conservatorship and shall recommend conservatorship to the court only if no suitable alternatives are available. This officer shall render to the court a written report of investigation before the hearing. The report to the court shall be comprehensive and shall contain all relevant aspects of the person’s medical, psychological, financial, family, vocational, and social condition, and information obtained from the person’s family members, close friends, social worker, or principal therapist. The report shall also contain all available information concerning the person’s real and personal property. The facilities providing intensive treatment or comprehensive evaluation shall disclose any records or information that may facilitate the investigation. If the conservatorship investigation order was made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 5352, the conservator in a proceeding under the Probate Code shall disclose any records or information that may facilitate the investigation. If the officer providing conservatorship investigation recommends against conservatorship, he or she shall set forth all alternatives available. A copy of the report shall be transmitted to the individual who originally recommended conservatorship, or, in a proceeding under the Probate Code, to the court that originally made a conservatorship investigation order, to the person or agency, if any, recommended to serve as conservator, and to the person recommended for conservatorship. The court may receive the report in evidence and may read and consider the contents thereof in rendering its judgment.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 5328, when a court with jurisdiction over a person in a criminal case orders an evaluation of the person’s mental condition pursuant to Section 5200, and that evaluation leads to a conservatorship investigation, the officer providing the conservatorship investigation shall serve a copy of the report required under subdivision (a) upon the defendant or the defendant’s counsel. Upon the prior written request of the defendant or the defendant’s counsel, the officer providing the conservatorship investigation shall also submit a copy of the report to the court hearing the criminal case, the district attorney, and the county probation department. The conservatorship investigation report and the information contained in that report, shall be kept confidential and shall not be further disclosed to anyone without the prior written consent of the defendant. After disposition of the criminal case, the court shall place all copies of the report in a sealed file, except as follows:
(1) The defendant and the defendant’s counsel may retain their copy.
(2) If the defendant is placed on probation status, the county probation department may retain a copy of the report for the purpose of supervision of the defendant until the probation is terminated, at which time the probation department shall return its copy of the report to the court for placement into the sealed file.

Section 5360 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5360.
(a) The officer providing conservatorship investigation shall recommend, in his or her report to the court, for or against imposition of a disability set forth in Section 5357 on the basis of the determination of the professional person who recommended conservatorship pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 5352, or the determination of the physician or psychologist who presented medical evidence to the court pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 5352.
(b) The officer providing conservatorship investigation shall recommend in his or her report any of the additional powers of a conservator set forth in Section 2591 of the Probate Code if the needs of the individual patient or his estate require such powers. In making this determination, the officer providing conservatorship investigation shall consult with the professional person who recommended conservatorship pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 5352, or the physician or psychologist who presented medical evidence to the court pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 5352.
SEC. 5.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides a procedure for the appointment of a conservator for a person who is determined to be gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or an impairment by chronic alcoholism, and requires an officer, including a county public guardian or a county mental health program, to conduct a conservatorship investigation and render a written report to the court of his or her investigation. Under existing law, a professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment for a gravely disabled person may recommend a conservatorship for that person, and the agency is required to disclose any records or information that may facilitate an investigation. Existing law requires the officer providing conservatorship investigation, when he or she concurs with the recommendation of the professional person or facility, to petition the superior court in the patient’s county of residence for a conservatorship. Existing law also provides for the establishment of a conservatorship for a person who is unable to properly provide for his or her personal needs or is substantially unable to manage his or her finances.
This bill would authorize the court, if a conservatorship has already been established under the Probate Code, and after a hearing attended by the conservatee, unless he or she waives presence, and the conservatee’s counsel, to order an investigation from the officer providing conservatorship investigation if the court, in consultation with a licensed physician or psychologist, as specified, providing comprehensive evaluation or intensive treatment, determines, in a specified proceeding, that the conservatee may be gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism and is unwilling to accept, or is incapable of accepting, treatment voluntarily. The bill would also require the court to appoint counsel to a conservatee if he or she cannot afford counsel. The bill would require the officer providing conservatorship investigation to petition the superior court in the patient’s county of residence to establish conservatorship if he or she concurs with the conservatorship investigation order of the court, and to file a copy of his or her report with the court. The bill would require a conservator to disclose any records or information that may facilitate the investigation. The bill would also make conforming changes.
By expanding the duties of the county officer providing conservatorship investigation, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 5350.2, 5352, 5354, and 5360 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to conservatorships."

Existing law authorizes the department to construct exclusive or preferential lanes for buses only or for buses and other high-occupancy vehicles.
Existing law authorizes a regional transportation agency, as defined, in cooperation with the department to apply to the California Transportation Commission to develop and operate high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, including administration and operation of a value-pricing program and exclusive or preferential lane facilities for public transit, consistent with established standards, requirements, and limitations that apply to specified facilities. Existing law requires the commission to conduct at least one public hearing in northern California and one in southern California for each eligible application submitted by the regional transportation agency. Existing law limits the number of approved facilities to not more than 4, 2 in northern California and 2 in southern California, and provides that no applications may be approved on or after January 1, 2012.
This bill would authorize a regional transportation agency or the department to apply to the commission to develop and operate HOT lanes or other toll facilities, as specified, and would delete the January 1, 2012, deadline for HOT lane applications and remove the existing limitation on the number of facilities that may be approved. The bill would include the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority within the definition of regional transportation authority for these purposes. The bill would delete the requirement that the facilities be consistent with the established standards, requirements, and limitations that apply to specified facilities and would instead require the commission to establish eligibility criteria set forth in guidelines for the development and operation of the facilities and provide for the review and approval by the commission of each proposed toll facility pursuant to those eligibility criteria. The bill would require toll facilities approved by the commission on or after January 1, 2016, to be subject to specified minimum requirements, including those relating to toll facility revenues. The bill would authorize a regional transportation agency or the state, as applicable, to issue bonds, refunding bonds, or bond anticipation notes backed by revenues generated from the facilities. The bill would delete the requirement that the commission conduct at least one public hearing in northern California and one in southern California for each eligible application and would instead require the commission to conduct at least one public hearing at or near the proposed toll facility. The bill would require a regional transportation agency that applies to the commission to reimburse the commission for all of the commission’s costs and expenses incurred in processing the application and to enter into specified agreements with the department and the Department of the California Highway Patrol. Before submitting an application to the commission, the bill would require a regional transportation agency to consult with every local transportation authority and every congestion management agency whose jurisdiction includes the facility that the regional transportation agency proposes to develop and operate pursuant to the above-described provisions. The bill would require the regional transportation agency to give a local transportation authority or congestion management agency, as specified, the option of entering into agreements, as needed, for project development, engineering, financial studies, and environmental documentation for each construction project or segment, and would authorize the local transportation authority or congestion management agency to be the lead agency for those construction projects or segments. The bill would provide that these provisions do not authorize or prohibit the conversion of any existing nontoll or nonuser-fee lanes into tolled or user-fee lanes, except that a high-occupancy vehicle lane may be converted into a HOT lane pursuant to its provisions.
This bill would create the Highway Toll Account in the State Transportation Fund for the management of funds received by the Department of Transportation for toll facilities operated by the department under the bill. The bill would continuously appropriate to the department the portion of revenues designated and necessary for the payment of debt service for those facilities.
This bill would become operative only if AB 914 is enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2016.","An act to amend Section 149.7 of, and to add Section 149.12 to, the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation, and making an appropriation therefor."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) authorizes the State Air Resources Board to adopt regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions.
(b) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) requires the State Air Resources Board to reduce statewide emissions of greenhouse gases to at least the 1990 emissions level by 2020 and to maintain and continue reductions thereafter.
(c) Continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical for the protection of all areas of the state, but especially for the state’s most disadvantaged communities, as those communities are affected first, and most frequently, by adverse impacts of climate change, including increased frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, heat, and flooding. The state’s most disadvantaged communities are also disproportionately impacted by the deleterious effects of climate change on public health.
(d) The State Air Resources Board’s actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be done in a manner that is transparent and accountable to the public and the Legislature. To this end, the State Air Resources Board must enhance the accessibility of information used to inform and evaluate regulatory measures developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(e) Transparency and accountability also are essential to ensuring the state’s actions are done in an equitable fashion that is protective and mindful of the effects on the state’s most disadvantaged communities.
(f) In recognition of the need for ongoing, permanent oversight over the implementation of the state’s climate policies, the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies will be established. The committee will uniquely provide an oversight perspective that connects the jurisdictions of several legislative standing committees, including those that have the issues of air quality, transportation, energy, and local government within their jurisdiction, which is critical given that the state has integrated climate change policies throughout the activities of many state agencies in addition to the State Air Resources Board.

require the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, by July 1, 2016, to amend those emergency regulations to establish a fire prevention fee in an amount not to exceed $152.33 and would authorize the board, on July 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, to adjust the fire prevention fee, as specified. The bill would
extend the time when the fire prevention fee is due and payable from 30 to 60 days from the date of assessment by the State Board of Equalization and would authorize the petition for redetermination to be filed within 60 days after service of the notice of determination, as specified.","An act to amend Sections

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the oversight boards to individual successor agencies were established pursuant to the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution Act, which prescribes that all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles will be consolidated into a single countywide oversight board by July 1, 2016.
(b) The Legislature further finds that collapsing all functions of the 71 oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles into a single countywide oversight board would create administrative gridlock and be a severe impediment to the expeditious disposition of properties owned by former redevelopment agencies.
(c) In recognition of these findings and to ensure that the duties of the 71 oversight boards and successor agencies in the County of Los Angeles will be met in a timely manner, it is the intent of the Legislature to continue all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles in existence until the respective successor agency requests dissolution of its oversight board and transfer of fiduciary duties to the countywide oversight board.
SEC. 2.
Section 34179 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
34179.

(6) One member of the public appointed by the county board of supervisors.
(7) One member representing the employees of the former redevelopment agency appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of supervisors from the recognized employee organization representing the largest number of former redevelopment agency employees employed by the successor agency at that time. If city or county employees performed administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from the recognized employee organization representing those employees. If a recognized employee organization does not exist for either the employees of the former redevelopment agency or the city or county employees performing administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from among the employees of the successor agency. In voting to approve a contract as an enforceable obligation, a member appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interested in the contract by virtue of being an employee of the successor agency or community for purposes of Section 1090 of the Government Code.
(8) If the county or a joint powers agency formed the redevelopment agency, the largest city by acreage in the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency may select one member. If there are no cities with territory in a project area of the redevelopment agency, the county superintendent of education may appoint an additional member to represent the public.
(9) If there are no special districts of the type that are eligible to receive property tax pursuant to Section 34188 within the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency, the county may appoint one member to represent the public.
(10) If a redevelopment agency was formed by an entity that is both a charter city and a county, the oversight board shall be composed of seven members selected as follows: three members appointed by the mayor of the city, if that appointment is subject to confirmation by the county board of supervisors; one member appointed by the largest special district, by property tax share, with territory in the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency, that is the type of special district that is eligible to receive property tax revenues pursuant to Section 34188; one member appointed by the county superintendent of education to represent schools; one member appointed by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to represent community college districts; and one member representing employees of the former redevelopment agency appointed by the mayor of the city, if that appointment is subject to confirmation by the county board of supervisors, to represent the largest number of former redevelopment agency employees employed by the successor agency at that time.

Each oversight board shall designate an official to whom the department may make those requests and who shall provide the department with the telephone number and email contact information for the purpose of communicating with the department pursuant to this subdivision. Except as otherwise provided in this part, if the department requests a review of a given oversight board action, it shall have 40 days from the date of its request to approve the oversight board action or return it to the oversight board for reconsideration and the oversight board action shall not be effective until approved by the department. If the department returns the oversight board action to the oversight board for reconsideration, the oversight board shall resubmit the modified action for department approval and the modified oversight board action shall not become effective until approved by the department. If the department reviews a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule, the department may eliminate or modify any item on that schedule prior to its approval. The county auditor-controller shall reflect the actions of the department in determining the amount of property tax revenues to allocate to the successor agency. The department shall provide notice to the successor agency and the county auditor-controller as to the reasons for its actions. To the extent that an oversight board continues to dispute a determination with the department, one or more future recognized obligation schedules may reflect any resolution of that dispute. The department may also agree to an amendment to a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to reflect a resolution of a disputed item, however, this shall not affect a past allocation of property tax or create a liability for any affected taxing entity.
(i) Oversight boards shall have fiduciary responsibilities to holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that benefit from distributions of property tax and other revenues pursuant to Section 34188. Further, the provisions of Division 4 (commencing with Section 1000)

(j)
Commencing
Except as specified in subdivision (q), commencing
on and after July 1, 2016, in each county where more than one oversight board was created by operation of the act adding this part, there shall be
only
one oversight board appointed as follows:
(1) One member may be appointed by the county board of supervisors.
(2) One member may be appointed by the city selection committee established pursuant to Section 50270 of the Government Code. In a city and county, the mayor may appoint one member.
(3) One member may be appointed by the independent special district selection committee established pursuant to Section 56332 of the Government Code, for the types of special districts that are eligible to receive property tax revenues pursuant to Section 34188.
(4) One member may be appointed by the county superintendent of education to represent schools if the superintendent is elected. If the county superintendent of education is appointed, then the appointment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made by the county board of education.

(6) One member of the public may be appointed by the county board of supervisors.
(7) One member may be appointed by the recognized employee organization representing the largest number of successor agency employees in the county.
(k) The Governor may appoint individuals to fill any oversight board member position described in subdivision (j) that has not been filled by July 15, 2016, or any member position that remains vacant for more than 60 days.
(l) Commencing on and after July 1, 2016, in each county where only one oversight board was created by operation of the act adding this part,
then
there will be no change to the composition of that oversight board as a result of the operation of subdivision (b).
(m) Any oversight board for a given successor agency shall cease to exist when all of the indebtedness of the dissolved redevelopment agency has been repaid or a successor agency has dissolved the oversight board pursuant to subdivision (q).
(n) An oversight board may direct a successor agency to provide legal or financial advice in addition to that provided by agency staff.

(q) Notwithstanding subdivision (j), an oversight board within the County of Los Angeles shall continue to independently operate until its successor agency adopts a resolution dissolving its oversight board and its oversight board approves that resolution, after which time the successor agency shall be overseen by the oversight board established pursuant to subdivision (j).
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances of the County of Los Angeles.","Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law authorizes, in each county where more than one oversight board was created, only one oversight board to be appointed on and after July 1, 2016.
This bill would require an oversight board within the County of Los Angeles to continue to independently operate past the July 1, 2016, consolidation date, until its successor agency adopts a resolution dissolving the board and the board approves that resolution, as provided.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.","An act to amend Section 34179 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to redevelopment."

6. I have not entered into any form of lease arrangement, rental agreement, or given any consent whatsoever to any persons to reside within the Property.

SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the City of Eureka in the County of Humboldt, the City of Fairfield in the County of Solano, and the Counties of Humboldt and Lake, it is first necessary to establish this program in a limited setting to analyze its effectiveness before considering an extension to other local jurisdictions.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
This authorization is necessary to expand the pilot program created in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1513 (Ch. 666, Stats. 2014) to those local jurisdictions that have expressly requested inclusion in this program to enable them to address the challenges they are facing with squatters in their respective jurisdictions.","Until January 1, 2018, existing law permits an owner of specified residential property in the Cities of Palmdale and Lancaster in the County of Los Angeles or the City of Ukiah in the County of Mendocino to register vacant real property with the local law enforcement agency and to execute a Declaration of Ownership of Residential Real Property that may be filed with the local law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. Existing law requires the local law enforcement agency with which the property is registered to respond as soon as practicable after being notified that an unauthorized person has been found on the property and take specified action, including requiring a person who is found on the property to produce written authorization to be on the property or other evidence demonstrating the person’s right to possession, and notifying any person who does not produce that authorization or other evidence that the owner or owner’s agency may seek to obtain a court order and that the person will be subject to arrest for trespass if he or she is subsequently found on the property in violation of that order.
This bill would extend the residential property subject to these provisions to include the City of Eureka in the County of Humboldt, the City of Fairfield in the City of Solano, and the Counties of Humboldt and Lake. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury and by imposing new duties on local law enforcement agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Eureka in the County of Humboldt, the City of Fairfield in the County of Solano, and the Counties of Humboldt and Lake..
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 527.11 and 527.12 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to residential property, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
Section 3003 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
3003.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an inmate who is released on parole or postrelease supervision as provided by Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450) shall be returned to the county that was the last legal residence of the inmate prior to his or her incarceration. For purposes of this subdivision, “last legal residence” shall not be construed to mean the county wherein the inmate committed an offense while confined in a state prison or local jail facility or while confined for treatment in a state hospital.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), an inmate may be returned to another county if that would be in the best interests of the public. If the Board of Parole Hearings setting the conditions of parole for inmates sentenced pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1168, as determined by the parole consideration panel, or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation setting the conditions of parole for inmates sentenced pursuant to Section 1170, decides on a return to another county, it shall place its reasons in writing in the parolee’s permanent record and include these reasons in the notice to the sheriff or chief of police pursuant to Section 3058.6. In making its decision, the paroling authority shall consider, among others, the following factors, giving the greatest weight to the protection of the victim and the safety of the community:
(1) The need to protect the life or safety of a victim, the parolee, a witness, or any other person.
(2) Public concern that would reduce the chance that the inmate’s parole would be successfully completed.
(3) The verified existence of a work offer, or an educational or vocational training program.
(4) The existence of family in another county with whom the inmate has maintained strong ties and whose support would increase the chance that the inmate’s parole would be successfully completed.
(5) The lack of necessary outpatient treatment programs for parolees receiving treatment pursuant to Section 2960.
(c) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, in determining an out-of-county commitment, shall give priority to the safety of the community and any witnesses and victims.
(d) In making its decision about an inmate who participated in a joint venture program pursuant to Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 2717.1) of Chapter 5, the paroling authority shall give serious consideration to releasing him or her to the county where the joint venture program employer is located if that employer states to the paroling authority that he or she intends to employ the inmate upon release.
(e) (1) The following information, if available, shall be released by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to local law enforcement agencies regarding a paroled inmate or inmate placed on postrelease community supervision pursuant to Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450) who is released in their jurisdictions:
(A) Last, first, and midd>
(ii) City and ZIP Code.
(iii) Date that the address provided pursuant to this subparagraph was proposed to be effective.
(K) Contact officer and unit, including all of the following information:
(i) Name and telephone number of each contact officer.
(ii) Contact unit type of each contact officer such as units responsible for parole, registration, or county probation.
(L) A digitized image of the photograph and at least a single digit fingerprint of the parolee.
(M) A geographic coordinate for the inmate’s residence location for use with a Geographical Information System (GIS) or comparable computer program.
(2) Unless the information is unavailable, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall electronically transmit to the county agency identified in subdivision (a) of Section 3451 the inmate’s tuberculosis status, specific medical, mental health, and outpatient clinic needs, and any medical concerns or disabilities for the county to consider as the offender transitions onto postrelease community supervision pursuant to Section 3450, for the purpose of identifying the medical and mental health needs of the individual. All transmissions to the county agency shall be in compliance with applicable provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Public Law 104-191), the federal Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act (HITECH) (Public Law 111-005), and the implementing of privacy and security regulations in Parts 160 and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This paragraph shall not take effect until the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or his or her designee, determines that this provision is not preempted by HIPAA.
(3) Except for the information required by paragraph (2), the information required by this subdivision shall come from the statewide parolee database. The information obtained from each source shall be based on the same timeframe.
(4) All of the information required by this subdivision shall be provided utilizing a computer-to-computer transfer in a format usable by a desktop computer system. The transfer of this information shall be continually available to local law enforcement agencies upon request.
(5) The unauthorized release or receipt of the information described in this subdivision is a violation of Section 11143.
(f) Notwithstanding any other law, an inmate who is released on parole shall not be returned to a location within 35 miles of the actual residence of a victim of, or a witness to, a violent felony as defined in paragraphs (1) to (7), inclusive, and paragraph (16) of subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or a felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on a person other than an accomplice that has been charged and proved as provided for in Section 12022.53, 12022.7, or 12022.9, if the victim or witness has requested additional distance in the placement of the inmate on parole, and if the Board of Parole Hearings or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation finds that there is a need to protect the life, safety, or well-being of a victim or witness.
(g) Notwithstanding any other law, an inmate who is released on parole for a violation of Section 288 or 288.5 whom the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determines poses a high risk to the public shall not be placed or reside, for the duration of his or her parole, within one-half mile of a public or private school including any or all of kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive.
(h) Notwithstanding any other law, an inmate who is released on parole or postrelease community supervision for a stalking offense shall not be returned to a location within 35 miles of the victim’s actual residence or place of employment if the victim or witness has requested additional distance in the placement of the inmate on parole or postrelease community supervision, and if the Board of Parole Hearings or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or the supervising county agency, as applicable, finds that there is a need to protect the life, safety, or well-being of the victim. If an inmate who is released on postrelease community supervision cannot be placed in his or her county of last legal residence in compliance with this subdivision, the supervising county agency may transfer the inmate to another county upon approval of the receiving county.
(i) The authority shall give consideration to the equitable distribution of parolees and the proportion of out-of-county commitments from a county compared to the number of commitments from that county when making parole decisions.
(j) An inmate may be paroled to another state pursuant to any other law. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall coordinate with local entities regarding the placement of inmates placed out of state on postrelease community supervision pursuant to Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450).
(k) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall be the agency primarily responsible for, and shall have control over, the program, resources, and staff implementing the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS) in conformance with subdivision (e). County agencies supervising inmates released to postrelease community supervision pursuant to Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450) shall provide any information requested by the department to ensure the availability of accurate information regarding inmates released from state prison. This information may include the issuance of warrants, revocations, or the termination of postrelease community supervision. On or before August 1, 2011, county agencies designated to supervise inmates released to postrelease community supervision shall notify the department that the county agencies have been designated as the local entity responsible for providing that supervision.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Department of Justice shall be the agency primarily responsible for the proper release of information under LEADS that relates to fingerprint cards.
(l) In addition to the requirements under subdivision (k), the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall submit to the Department of Justice data to be included in the supervised release file of the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) so that law enforcement can be advised through CLETS of all persons on postrelease community supervision and the county agency designated to provide supervision. The data required by this subdivision shall be provided via electronic transfer.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law generally requires that an inmate released on parole or postrelease community supervision be returned to the county of last legal residence. Existing law provides, however, that an inmate who is released on parole for an offense involving stalking shall not be returned to a location within 35 miles of the victim’s actual residence or place of employment if specified criteria are satisfied.
This bill would make that provision applicable to an inmate released on postrelease community supervision. The bill would also authorize a supervising county agency to transfer an inmate who is released on postrelease community supervision to another county, upon approval of the receiving county, when the inmate cannot be placed in his or her county of last legal residence in compliance with this provision. The bill would make other clarifying changes. By imposing additional duties on supervising county agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 3003 of the Penal Code, relating to postconviction supervised release."

(l) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997, provides for the issuance of a driver’s license to an applicant who is at least 16 years of age but under 18 years of age pursuant to the provisional licensing program. Under existing law, a person licensed under this program is prohibited, during the first 12 months after issuance of a provisional license, from driving during the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or from transporting passengers who are under 20 years of age, subject to specified exceptions. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is an infraction.
This bill would prohibit a person with a provisional license, from engaging in those prohibited activities until the provisional period ends when the person reaches 18 years of age. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

SECTION 1.
Section 14026 of the
Elections Code
is amended to read:
14026.
As used in this chapter:
(a)“At-large method of election” means any of the following methods of electing members to the governing body of a political subdivision:
(1)One in which the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body.
(2)One in which the candidates are required to reside within given areas of the jurisdiction and the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body.
(3)One which combines at-large elections with district-based elections.
(b)“District-based elections” means a method of electing members to the governing body of a political subdivision in which the candidate must reside within an election district that is a divisible part of the political subdivision and is elected only by voters residing within that election district.
(c)“Political subdivision” means a geographic area of representation created for the provision of government services, including, but not limited to, a city, a school district, a community college district, or other district organized pursuant to state law.
(d)“Protected class” means a class of voters who are members of a race, color, or language minority group, as this class is defined in the federal Voting Rights Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973 et seq.).
(e)“Racially polarized voting” means voting in which there is a difference, as defined in case law regarding enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973 et seq.), in the choice of candidates or other electoral choices that are preferred by voters in a protected class, and in the choice of candidates and electoral choices that are preferred by voters in the rest of the electorate. The methodologies for estimating group voting behavior as approved in applicable federal cases to enforce the federal Voting Rights Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973 et seq.) to establish racially polarized voting may be used for purposes of this section to prove that elections are characterized by racially polarized voting.","Existing law prohibits a person in possession of a firearm, uniformed peace officer, private guard, or security personnel from being stationed or posted at a polling place without written authorization of the appropriate elections official. Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years, or in a county jail for not more than one year, or by both fine and imprisonment.
Existing law prohibits the hiring of or arranging for a person in possession of a firearm, uniformed peace officer, private guard, or security personnel to be stationed or posted at a polling place without written authorization of the appropriate elections official. Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years, or in a county jail for not more than one year, or by both fine and imprisonment.
This bill would increase the maximum fine for those offenses to $16,000 and require that the fine amount be adjusted annually by any annual increase in the California Consumer Price Index, as described.
The California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA) prohibits the use of an at-large election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice or otherwise influence the outcome of an election. The CVRA provides that a violation of the act is established if it is shown that racially polarized voting, as defined, has occurred, and provides that the occurrence of racially polarized voting shall be determined from examining the results of elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class or elections involving ballot measures or other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class. The CVRA provides that a voter who is a member of a protected class, as specified, may bring an action in superior court to enforce the provisions of the CVRA, and, if the voter prevails in the case, he or she may be awarded reasonable litigation costs and attorney’s fees.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to provisions of law defining several terms for purposes of the CVRA.","An act to amend

Existing law requires a health care provider prior to the delivery of health care services via telehealth to inform the patient about the use of telehealth and obtain verbal or written consent from the patient for the use of telehealth. Existing law, the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act, provides for the registration of marriage and family therapist interns and regulates marriage and family therapist trainees. Existing law requires applicants for a marriage and family therapist license to complete specified experience subject to certain limitations, including no more than a certain number of hours providing counseling services via telehealth. Existing law requires all marriage and family therapist trainees and registrants to be supervised at all times by a supervisor, as defined, responsible for ensuring that the extent, kind, and quality of counseling performed is consistent with the training and experience of the person being supervised. Existing law requires the supervisor to be responsible to the board for compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations governing the practice of marriage and family therapy.
This bill would expand the definition of health care provider to include a marriage and family therapist intern or trainee, as specified. The bill would also authorize a marriage and family therapist intern and trainee to provide services via telehealth if he or she is supervised as required by the act, and is acting within the scope authorized by the act and in accordance with any regulations governing the use of telehealth promulgated by the Board of Behavioral Sciences.","An act to amend Sections 2290.5 and 4980.43 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to healing arts."

SECTION 1.
Section 1720 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1720.
(a) As used in this chapter, “public works” means:
(1) Construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds, except work done directly by any public utility company pursuant to order of the Public Utilities Commission or other public authority. For purposes of this paragraph, “construction” includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction, including, but not limited to, inspection and land surveying work, and work performed during the postconstruction phases of construction, including, but not limited to, all cleanup work at the jobsite. For purposes of this paragraph, “installation” includes, but is not limited to, the assembly and disassembly of freestanding and affixed modular office systems.
(2) Work done for irrigation, utility, reclamation, and improvement districts, and other districts of this type. “Public work” does not include the operation of the irrigation or drainage system of any irrigation or reclamation district, except as used in Section 1778 relating to retaining wages.
(3) Street, sewer, or other improvement work done under the direction and supervision or by the authority of any officer or public body of the state, or of any political subdivision or district thereof, whether the political subdivision or district operates under a freeholder’s charter or not.

(1) The payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor, subcontractor, or developer.
(2) Performance of construction work by the state or political subdivision in execution of the project.

(5) Money loaned by the state or political subdivision that is to be repaid on a contingent basis.
(6) Credits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b):
(1) Private residential projects built on private property are not subject to the requirements of this chapter unless the projects are built pursuant to an agreement with a state agency, redevelopment agency, or local public housing authority.
(2) If the state or a political subdivision requires a private developer to perform construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work on a public work of improvement as a condition of regulatory approval of an otherwise private development project, and the state or political subdivision contributes no more money, or the equivalent of money, to the overall project than is required to perform this public improvement work, and the state or political subdivision maintains no proprietary interest in the overall project, then only the public improvement work shall thereby become subject to this chapter.
(3) (A) If the state or a political subdivision reimburses a private developer for costs that would normally be borne by the public, or provides directly or indirectly a public subsidy to a private development project that is de minimis in the context of the project, an otherwise private development project shall not thereby become subject to the requirements of this chapter.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a public subsidy is de minimis if it is both less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) and less than 2 percent of the total project cost. This subparagraph shall not apply to a project that was advertised for bid, or a contract that was awarded, before July 1, 2016.
(4) The construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing units for low- or moderate-income persons pursuant to paragraph (5) or (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the Health and Safety Code that are paid for solely with moneys from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund established pursuant to Section 33334.3 of the Health and Safety Code or that are paid for by a combination of private funds and funds available pursuant to Section 33334.2 or 33334.3 of the Health and Safety Code do not constitute a project that is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.
(5) Unless otherwise required by a public funding program, the construction or rehabilitation of privately owned residential projects is not subject to the requirements of this chapter if one or more of the following conditions are met:
(A) The project is a self-help housing project in which no fewer than 500 hours of construction work associated with the homes are to be performed by the home buyers.
(B) The project consists of rehabilitation or expansion work associated with a facility operated on a not-for-profit basis as temporary or transitional housing for homeless persons with a total project cost of less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
(C) Assistance is provided to a household as either mortgage assistance, downpayment assistance, or for the rehabilitation of a single-family home.
(D) The project consists of new construction, expansion, or rehabilitation work associated with a facility developed by a nonprofit organization to be operated on a not-for-profit basis to provide emergency or transitional shelter and ancillary services and assistance to homeless adults and children. The nonprofit organization operating the project shall provide, at no profit, not less than 50 percent of the total project cost from nonpublic sources, excluding real property that is transferred or leased. Total project cost includes the value of donated labor, materials, architectural, and engineering services.
(E) The public participation in the project that would otherwise meet the criteria of subdivision (b) is public funding in the form of below-market interest rate loans for a project in which occupancy of at least 40 percent of the units is restricted for at least 20 years, by deed or regulatory agreement, to individuals or families earning no more than 80 percent of the area median income.
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the following projects shall not, solely by reason of this section, be subject to the requirements of this chapter:
(1) Qualified residential rental projects, as defined by Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, financed in whole or in part through the issuance of bonds that receive allocation of a portion of the state ceiling pursuant to Chapter 11.8 (commencing with Section 8869.80) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code on or before December 31, 2003.
(2) Single-family residential projects financed in whole or in part through the issuance of qualified mortgage revenue bonds or qualified veterans’ mortgage bonds, as defined by Section 143 of the Internal Revenue Code, or with mortgage credit certificates under a Qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, as defined by Section 25 of the Internal Revenue Code, that receive allocation of a portion of the state ceiling pursuant to Chapter 11.8 (commencing with Section 8869.80) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code on or before December 31, 2003.
(3) Low-income housing projects that are allocated federal or state low-income housing tax credits pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 50199.4) of Part 1 of Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, or Section 12206, 17058, or 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, on or before December 31, 2003.
(e) If a statute, other than this section, or a regulation, other than a regulation adopted pursuant to this section, or an ordinance or a contract applies this chapter to a project, the exclusions set forth in subdivision (d) do not apply to that project.
(f) For purposes of this section, references to the Internal Revenue Code mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and include the corresponding predecessor sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
(g) The amendments made to this section by either Chapter 938 of the Statutes of 2001 or the act adding this subdivision shall not be construed to preempt local ordinances requiring the payment of prevailing wages on housing projects.","Existing law requires that, except as specified, not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages, determined by the Director of Industrial Relations, be paid to workers employed on public works projects. Existing law defines “public works” to include, among other things, construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for, in whole or in part, out of public funds, but exempts from that definition, among other projects, an otherwise private development project if the state or political subdivision provides, directly or indirectly, a public subsidy to the private development project that is de minimis in the context of the project.
This bill would provide that a public subsidy is de minimis if it is both less than $250,000 and less than 2% of the total project cost. The bill would specify that those provisions do not apply to a project that was advertised for bid, or a contract that was awarded, before July 1, 2016.","An act to amend Section 1720 of the Labor Code, relating to public works."

Existing law, the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Act of 2014, provides for the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable multifamily supportive housing, affordable transitional housing, affordable rental housing, and related facilities for veterans and their families to allow veterans to access and maintain housing stability. Existing law requires the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to work collaboratively for those purposes.

Section 13112 of the Elections Code is amended to read:
13112.
The Secretary of State shall conduct a drawing of the letters of the alphabet, the result of which shall be known as a randomized alphabet. The procedure shall be as follows:
(a) Each letter of the alphabet shall be written on a separate slip of paper, each of which shall be folded and inserted into a capsule. Each capsule shall be opaque and of uniform weight, color, size, shape, and texture. The capsules shall be placed in a container, which shall be shaken vigorously in order to mix the capsules thoroughly. The container then shall be opened and the capsules removed at random one at a time. As each capsule is removed, it shall be opened and the letter on the slip of paper read aloud and written down. The resulting random order of letters constitutes the randomized alphabet, which is to be used in the same manner as the conventional alphabet in determining the order of all candidates in all elections. For example, if two candidates with the surnames Campbell and Carlson are running for the same office, their order on the ballot will depend on the order in which the letters M and R were drawn in the randomized alphabet drawing.
(b) (1) There shall be six drawings, three in each even-numbered year and three in each odd-numbered year. Each drawing shall be held at 11 a.m. on the date specified in this subdivision. The results of each drawing shall be mailed immediately to each county elections official responsible for conducting an election to which the drawing applies, who shall use it in determining the order on the ballot of the names of the candidates for office.
(A) The first drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the April general law city elections of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to those elections and any other elections held at the same time.
(B) The second drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the direct primary of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in that election.
(C) (i) The third drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the November general election of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the November general election.
(ii) In the case of the primary election and the November general election, the Secretary of State shall certify and transmit to each county elections official the order in which the names of federal and state candidates, with the exception of candidates for State Senate and Assembly, shall appear on the ballot. The elections official shall determine the order on the ballot of all other candidates using the appropriate randomized alphabet for that purpose.
(D) The fourth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the March general law city elections of each odd-numbered year, and shall apply to those elections and any other elections held at the same time.
(E) The fifth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June of each odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.
(F) The sixth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.
(2) If there will be an election of candidates to a special district, school district, charter city, or other local government body at the same time as one of the five major election dates specified in subparagraphs (A) to (F), inclusive, of paragraph (1) and the last possible day to file nomination papers for the local election would occur after the date of the drawing for the major election date, the procedure set forth in Section 13113 shall apply.
(c) Each randomized alphabet drawing shall be open to the public. At least 10 days before a drawing, the Secretary of State shall notify the news media and other interested parties of the date, time, and place of the drawing. The president of each statewide association of local officials with responsibilities for conducting elections shall be invited by the Secretary of State to attend each drawing or send a representative. The state chairman of each qualified political party shall be invited to attend or send a representative in the case of drawings held to determine the order of candidates on the primary election ballot, the November general election ballot, or a special election ballot as provided for in subdivision (d).
(d) In the case of a special election for State Assembly, State Senate, or Representative in Congress, on the first weekday after the close of filing of nomination papers for the office, the Secretary of State shall conduct a public drawing to produce a randomized alphabet in the same manner as provided for in subdivisions (a) and (c). The resulting randomized alphabet shall be used for determining the order on the ballot of the candidates in both the primary election for the special election and in the special election.
(e) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 7.
Section 13112 is added to the Elections Code, to read:

Each capsule shall be opaque and of uniform weight, color, size, shape, and texture. The capsules shall be placed in a container, which shall be shaken vigorously in order to mix the capsules thoroughly.

For example, if two candidates with the surnames Campbell and Carlson are running for the same office, their order on the ballot will depend on the order in which the letters M and R were drawn in the randomized alphabet drawing.
(b) (1) There shall be four drawings, two in each even-numbered year and two in each odd-numbered year. Each drawing shall be held at 11 a.m. on the date specified in this subdivision. The results of each drawing shall be mailed immediately to each county elections official responsible for conducting an election to which the drawing applies, who shall use it in determining the order on the ballot of the names of the candidates for office.
(A) The first drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the direct primary of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in that election.
(B) (i)   The second drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the November general election of an even-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the November general election.
(ii) In the case of the primary election and the November general election, the Secretary of State shall certify and transmit to each county elections official the order in which the names of federal and state candidates, with the exception of candidates for State Senate and Assembly, shall appear on the ballot. The elections official shall determine the order on the ballot of all other candidates using the appropriate randomized alphabet for that purpose.
(C) The third drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June of each odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.
(D) The fourth drawing under this subdivision shall take place on the 82nd day before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the odd-numbered year, and shall apply to all candidates on the ballot in the elections held on that date.
(2) If there will be an election of candidates to a special district, school district, charter city, or other local government body at the same time as one of the four major election dates specified in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of paragraph (1) and the last possible day to file nomination papers for the local election would occur after the date of the drawing for the major election date, the procedure set forth in Section 13113 shall apply.
(c) Each randomized alphabet drawing shall be open to the public. At least 10 days before a drawing, the Secretary of State shall notify the news media and other interested parties of the date, time, and place of the drawing. The president of each statewide association of local officials with responsibilities for conducting elections shall be invited by the Secretary of State to attend each drawing or send a representative. The state chairman of each qualified political party shall be invited to attend or send a representative in the case of drawings held to determine the order of candidates on the primary election ballot, the November general election ballot, or a special election ballot as provided for in subdivision (d).
(d) In the case of a special election for State Assembly, State Senate, or Representative in Congress, on the first weekday after the close of filing of nomination papers for the office, the Secretary of State shall conduct a public drawing to produce a randomized alphabet in the same manner as provided for in subdivisions (a) and (c). The resulting randomized alphabet shall be used for determining the order on the ballot of the candidates in both the primary election for the special election and in the special election.
(e) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2020.
SEC. 8.
This act shall not be construed to shorten the term of office of any officeholder in office on January 1, 2020. For each office for which this act causes the election to be held at a later date than would have been the case in the absence of this act, the incumbent shall hold office until a successor qualifies for the office, but in no event shall the term of an incumbent be extended by more than four years.","Existing law establishes election dates in each year, which are the second Tuesday of April in each even-numbered year, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March of each odd-numbered year, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June in each year, and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each year.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2020, eliminate the established election dates in March and April.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Sections 1000, 1301, and 13112 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

Section 361.8 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
361.8.
(a) The Legislature declares that a child of a minor parent or nonminor dependent parent shall not be considered to be at risk of abuse or neglect solely on the basis of information concerning the parent’s or parents’ placement history, past behaviors, or health or mental health diagnoses occurring prior to the pregnancy, although that information may be taken into account when considering whether other factors exist that place the child at risk of abuse or neglect.
(b) In the case of a child for whom one or both minor parents have been adjudged to be dependent children of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 300, all of the following shall apply:
(1) Paragraphs (10) and (11) of subdivision (b) of Section 361.5 shall not apply, unless one or more of the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) to (9), inclusive, and paragraphs (12) to (16), inclusive, of subdivision (b) of Section 361.5 apply.
(2) A party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights over, a child born to a parent or parents who were minors at the time of the child’s birth shall demonstrate to the court that reasonable efforts were made to provide remedial services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the minor parent or parents, and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.
(3) The efforts made pursuant to paragraph (2) shall utilize the available resources of the child and his or her minor parent’s or parents’ extended family, social services agencies, caregivers, and other available service providers.
(c) For purposes of this section, “child” and “minor parent” shall have the same definitions as set forth in Section 16002.5.

SEC. 3.
Section 16002.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
16002.5.
It is the intent of the Legislature to maintain the continuity of the family unit and to support and preserve families headed by minor parents and nonminor dependent parents who are themselves under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by ensuring that minor parents and nonminor dependent parents and their children are placed together in as family-like a setting as possible, unless it has been determined that placement together poses a risk to the child. It is also the intent of the Legislature to ensure that complete and accurate data on parenting minor and nonminor dependents is collected, and that the State Department of Social Services shall ensure that the following information is publicly available on a quarterly basis by county about parenting minor and nonminor dependents: total number of parenting minor and nonminor dependents in each county, their age, their ethnic group, their placement type, their time in care, the number of children they have, and whether their children are court dependents.
(a) To the greatest extent possible, minor parents and nonminor dependent parents and their children shall be provided with access to existing services for which they may be eligible, that are specifically targeted at supporting, maintaining, and developing both the parent-child bond and the dependent parent’s ability to provide a permanent and safe home for the child. Examples of these services may include, but are not limited to, child care, parenting classes, child development classes, and frequent visitation.
(b) Child welfare agencies may provide minor parents and nonminor dependent parents with access to social workers or resource specialists who have received training on the needs of teenage parents and available resources, including, but not limited to, maternal and child health programs, child care, and child development classes. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to update the case plans for pregnant and parenting dependents within 60 calendar days of the date the agency is informed of a pregnancy. When updating the case plan, child welfare agencies may hold a specialized conference to assist pregnant or parenting foster youth and nonminor dependents with planning for healthy parenting and identifying appropriate resources and services, and to inform the case plan. The specialized conference shall include the pregnant or parenting minor or nonminor dependent, family members, and other supportive adults, and the specially trained social worker or resource specialist. The specialized conference may include other individuals, including, but not limited to, a public health nurse, a community health worker, or other personnel with a comprehensive knowledge of available maternal and child resources, including public benefit programs. Participation in the specialized conference shall be voluntary on the part of the foster youth or nonminor dependent and assistance in identifying and accessing resources shall not be dependent on participation in the conference.
(c) The minor parents and nonminor dependent parents shall be given the ability to attend school, complete homework, and participate in age and developmentally appropriate activities unrelated to and separate from parenting.

(e) Foster care placements for minor parents and nonminor dependent parents and their children shall demonstrate a willingness and ability to provide support and assistance to minor parents and nonminor dependent parents and their children, shall support the preservation of the family unit, and shall refer a minor parent or nonminor dependent parent to preventive services to address any concerns regarding the safety, health, or well-being of the child, and to help prevent, whenever possible, the filing of a petition to declare the child a dependent of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 300.
(f) Contact between the child, the custodial parent, and the noncustodial parent shall be facilitated if that contact is found to be in the best interest of the child.
(g) For the purpose of this section, “child” refers to the child born to the minor parent.
(h) For the purpose of this section, “minor parent” refers to a dependent child who is also a parent.

SEC. 4.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge a child to be a dependent of the court under certain circumstances, including when the child has been left without any provision for support or when a parent or guardian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment. Existing law provides that the Legislature declares that a child whose parent has been adjudged a dependent child of the court shall not be considered at risk of abuse or neglect solely because of the age, dependent status, or foster care status of the parent.
This bill would additionally declare that a child whose parent has been adjudged a dependent child of the court shall not be considered at risk of abuse or neglect solely on the basis of information concerning the parent’s placement history, past behaviors, health or mental health diagnoses occurring prior to the pregnancy, except as specified.
Existing law provides that reunification services need not be provided to the family of a dependent child under certain circumstances.
This bill would enact certain exceptions to that provision that would apply in the case of a child for whom one or both minor parents have been adjudged to be dependent children of the juvenile court, thereby providing the family access to reunification services. The bill would also require, in those cases, a party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights over, a child born to a parent or parents who were minors at the time of the child’s birth to demonstrate to the court that reasonable efforts were made to provide remedial services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the minor parent or parents, that these efforts have proved unsuccessful, and that those efforts utilize the available resources of the child and his or her minor parent or parents extended family, social services agencies, caregivers, and other available service providers. By imposing a higher level of service on county employees, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires the clerk of the superior court to open a separate court file for nonminor dependents under the dependency, delinquency, or transition jurisdiction of the court and limits access to those files.
This bill would require the clerk of the superior court to maintain court files and records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent separate from court files and records concerning his or her child, as specified. The bill would authorize dependency court records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent to be disclosed to the county and the court in the child’s dependency proceedings, but would require information from the records to only be admitted as evidence in the child’s dependency proceedings pursuant to a certain court order. The bill would authorize any party to the child’s dependency proceedings to request the admittance of the records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent as evidence at any stage of the child’s dependency proceedings.
Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to maintain the continuity of the family unit and to support and preserve families headed by minor dependent parents and nonminor dependent parents. Existing law requires foster care placements for minor parents and their children to demonstrate a willingness and ability to provide support and assistance to minor parents and their children.
This bill would additionally require those foster care placements to support the preservation of the family unit and to refer a minor dependent parent or nonminor dependent parent to preventive services to address any concerns regarding the safety, health, or well-being of the child, and to help prevent, whenever possible, the filing of a petition to declare the child a dependent of the juvenile court.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 16002.5 of, and to add Sections 361.8 and 825.5 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to foster care."

However, if conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings are commenced under this section to resolve a controversy, the statute of limitations that applies to a civil action concerning that controversy is tolled upon commencement of conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings, and until 30 days after the completion of those proceedings. As used in this subdivision, “completion of those proceedings” means the filing of a statement of agreement or nonagreement by the conciliator or mediator, or the rendering of a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration committee.
(B) If a proceeding for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of a dispute between a dealer and a grower is commenced under this subdivision for conformance with the financial terms by a dealer to a grower, and the decision in the proceeding is in favor of the grower, the decision may include a provision requiring compensation to the grower for the estimated value of the seed production services a grower provides to a dealer, including, but not limited to, labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.
(C) If a dealer fails to comply with the financial obligations of a judgment rendered in a conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceeding between a dealer and a grower commenced pursuant to this subdivision following the conclusion of all appeals in the proceeding, the secretary may revoke the dealer’s registration and prevent the dealer from renewing his or her registration until the time the financial obligation is fulfilled.
(2) Conciliation, mediation, or arbitration shall not affect any enforcement action by the secretary pursuant to this chapter. Regulations adopted by the secretary for the mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of disputes shall require that adequate notice be provided on the seed label notifying any buyer of the requirement to submit a dispute to mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration as a prerequisite to other dispute resolution mechanisms, including litigation.
(g) Establish additional labeling requirements for coated, pelleted, encapsulated, mat, tape, or any other germination medium or device used on seed in order that the purchaser or consumer will be informed as to the actual amount of seed purchased.

The lien shall be to the extent of the agreed price, if any, for that product so sold. If there is no agreed price or a method for determining it that is agreed upon, the extent of the lien is the value of the farm product as of the date of the delivery. Any portion of that product or the processed or manufactured forms of that product, in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the total amount owed to producers under contract, shall be free and clear of that lien.
(b) Every producer of a flower, agricultural, or vegetable seed that sells seed that is grown by him or her, when the seed was purchased or supplied by the grower and not supplied by the dealer or an independent third party who paid for the seed, to any seed dealer under contract, express or implied, in addition to all other rights and remedies that are provided for by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product. The lien shall be to the extent of the agreed price, if any, for that product so sold. If there is no agreed price or a method for determining it that is agreed upon, the extent of the lien is the value of that product as of the date of the delivery. Any portion of that product or the processed or manufactured forms of that product, in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the total amount owed to producers under contract, shall be free and clear of that lien.

Section 56109 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:
56109.
“Farm product” includes every agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and vegetable product of the soil, poultry and poultry products, livestock products and livestock not for immediate slaughter, bees and apiary products, hay, dried beans, honey, and cut flowers. It does not, however, include any timber or timber product, flower or agricultural or vegetable seed, any milk product that is subject to the licensing and bonding provisions of Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 61801) of Part 3 of Division 21, any aquacultural product, or cattle sold to any person who is bonded under the federal Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 181, et seq.).

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law, the California Seed Law, requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, by regulation, to adopt, among other things, specified lists of plants and crops that the secretary finds are or may be grown in the state or that the secretary finds are detrimental to agriculture if they occur incidentally in other crops, as prescribed, a list of noxious weed seed that the secretary finds are prohibitive noxious weed seed, and methods and procedures, upon recommendation of the Seed Advisory Board, for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of disputes between labelers and any persons concerning conformance with label statements, advertisements, or other disputes regarding the quality or performance of seed.
This bill would expand this regulation authority to also make those methods and procedures for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of those disputes applicable to disputes concerning conformance with financial terms or the lack of payment by a dealer to a grower, as provided. By expanding the scope of that regulation authority, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law specifies that every producer of any farm product that sells any farm product that is grown by him or her to any processor under contract, express or implied, in addition to all other rights and remedies that are provided by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that farm product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.
This bill would also specify that every producer of a flower, agricultural, or vegetable seed that sells seed that is grown by him or her, when the seed was purchased or supplied by the grower and not supplied by the dealer or an independent 3rd party who paid for the seed, to any seed dealer under contract, express or implied, in addition to all rights and remedies that are provided for by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.
(3) Existing law requires that any person engaged in the business of buying, receiving on consignment, soliciting for sale on commission, or negotiating the sale of farm products from a licensee or producer for resale, to be licensed. Existing law, for purposes of those provisions, defines “farm product” to include every agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and vegetable product of the soil, poultry and poultry products, livestock products and livestock not for immediate slaughter, bees and apiary products, hay, dried beans, honey, and cut flowers, but excludes from that definition any timber or timber product, flower or agricultural or vegetable seed not purchased from a producer, any milk product that is subject to specified licensing requirements, any aquacultural product, or cattle sold to any person who is bonded under a specified federal law.
This bill would revise that definition to exclude flower, agricultural, or vegetable seeds from the definition of farm products, rather than only those that have not been purchased from a producer.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 52332, 55631, and 56109 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to farm products."

The authority of a person designated as a peace officer pursuant to this paragraph includes the full powers and duties of a peace officer as provided by Section 830.1. A transit, harbor, or port district reserve police officer, or a city or county reserve peace officer who is not provided with the powers and duties authorized by Section 830.1, has the powers and duties authorized in Section 830.33, or in the case of a reserve park ranger, the powers and duties that are authorized in Section 830.31, or in the case of a reserve housing authority patrol officer, the powers and duties that are authorized in subdivision (d) of Section 830.31, and a school district reserve police officer or a community college district reserve police officer has the powers and duties authorized in Section 830.32.
(b) Whenever a person designated by a Native American tribe recognized by the United States Secretary of the Interior is deputized or appointed by the county sheriff as a reserve or auxiliary sheriff or a reserve deputy sheriff, and is assigned to the prevention and detection of crime and the general enforcement of the laws of this state by the county sheriff, the person is a peace officer, if the person qualifies as set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 832.6. The authority of a peace officer pursuant to this subdivision includes the full powers and duties of a peace officer as provided by Section 830.1.
(c) A person deputized or appointed by the proper authority as a peace officer pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b), including, but not limited to, a person who is deputized or appointed by the proper authority as a reserve deputy sheriff or a reserve city police officer, is an employee of the appointing authority for purposes of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Part 2.8 (commencing with Section 12900) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(d) Whenever a person is summoned to the aid of any uniformed peace officer, the summoned person is vested with the powers of a peace officer that are expressly delegated to him or her by the summoning officer or that are otherwise reasonably necessary to properly assist the officer.","Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is unlawful to engage in specified discriminatory practices in employment or housing accommodations on the basis of certain specified characteristics, including race, creed, or national origin.

(a) (1) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and paragraph (2), an action under Section 25360 for the recovery of costs incurred by the department or a regional board in carrying out or overseeing a response or corrective action pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 25100), or as otherwise authorized by law, shall be commenced within three years after completion of all response or corrective actions has been certified by the department or a regional board.
(B) If operation and maintenance is required as part of the response or corrective action, the action for recovery of costs incurred by the department or a regional board shall be commenced within three years after completion of operation and maintenance has been certified by the department or a regional board.
(2) No action described in paragraph (1) may be brought that, as of December 31, 2015, had not been commenced by the department within three years after the certification of the completion of the removal or remedial action.
(b) An action under subdivision (c) of Section 25352 for costs incurred by the department for the purposes specified in subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 25352 shall be commenced within three years after certification by the department of the completion of the activities authorized under subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25352.
(c) In an action described in subdivision (a) or (b) for recovery of response or corrective action costs, oversight costs, or damages, where the court has entered a judgment for past costs or damages, the court shall also enter an order reserving jurisdiction over the case and the court shall have continuing jurisdiction to determine any future liability and the amount of the future liability. The department or regional board may immediately enforce the judgment for past costs and damages. The department or the regional board may apply for a court judgment for further costs and damages that have been incurred during the response or corrective action, operation and maintenance, or during the performance of the activities authorized by Section 25352, but the application shall be made not later than three years after the certification of completion of the response or corrective action, operation and maintenance, or activities authorized pursuant to Section 25352.
(d) An action may be commenced under Section 25360 or subdivision (c) of Section 25352 at any time prior to expiration of the applicable limitations period provided for by this section.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (e), if the trier of fact finds the evidence insufficient to establish each party’s portion of costs under subdivision (a), the court shall apportion those costs, to the extent practicable, according to equitable principles, among the defendants.
(c) The standard of liability for costs recoverable pursuant to this chapter is strict liability.
(d) A person who has incurred response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter, Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 25100), or the federal act may seek contribution or indemnity from any person who is liable pursuant to this chapter. An action to enforce a claim may be brought as a cross-complaint by any defendant in an action brought pursuant to Section 25360 or this section, or in a separate action after the person seeking contribution or indemnity has paid response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter, Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 25100), or the federal act. A plaintiff or cross-complainant seeking contribution or indemnity shall give written notice to the director upon filing an action or cross-complaint under this section. In resolving claims for contribution or indemnity, the court may allocate costs among liable parties using appropriate equitable factors.
(e) Notwithstanding this chapter, a response action contractor who is found liable for any costs recoverable under this chapter and who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that only a portion of those costs are attributable to the response action contractor’s actions shall be required to pay only that portion of the costs attributable to the response action contractor’s actions.

(b) For purposes of this section, “household hazardous waste collection program” means a program or facility, specified in Section 25218.1, in which hazardous wastes from households and conditionally exempt small quantity generators are collected and ultimately transferred to an authorized hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility.
(c) Except as provided in subdivision (a), this section does not affect or modify the obligations or liabilities of a person imposed pursuant to state or federal law.","(1) Existing law, the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act, imposes liability for hazardous substances removal or remedial actions and requires the Attorney General to recover from the liable person, as defined, certain costs incurred by the Department of Toxic Substances Control or a California regional water quality control board, upon the request of the department or regional board. The act authorizes, except as specified, a party found liable for any costs or expenditures recoverable under the act for those actions to establish, as specified, that only a portion of those costs or expenditures are attributable to the party, and requires the party to pay only for that portion. If each party does not establish its liability, the act requires a court to apportion those costs or expenditures, as specified, among the defendants and the remaining portion of the judgment is required to be paid from the Toxic Substances Control Account. Existing law authorizes the money deposited in the Toxic Substances Control Account in the General Fund to be appropriated to the Department of Toxic Substances Control for specified purposes, including the payment of the costs incurred by the state for those actions.
This bill would specifically apply those provisions to response and corrective actions, instead of to removal and remedial actions, and would delete the requirement that the remaining portion of a judgment for costs and expenditures that is not apportioned among the liable persons be paid from that account.
(2) The act requires an action brought pursuant to it for the recovery of the costs of a removal or remedial action, or for the recovery of specified administrative costs, to be commenced within 3 years after completion of the removal or remedial action has been certified by the department.
This bill would, except as provided, instead allow an action for the recovery of the costs of carrying out or overseeing a response or corrective action to be commenced either within that 3-year period or, if operation and maintenance is required as part of the response or corrective action, within 3 years after completion of operation and maintenance has been certified by the department or a regional board.","An act to amend Sections 25360.4, 25363, and 25366.5 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to hazardous substances."

In preparing the proposed map, the legislative body may seek public input, including accepting proposed maps submitted by the public.
(b) If the legislative body is changing from an at-large method of election to a district-based election, as those terms are defined in Section 14026 of the Elections Code, the legislative body shall hold public hearings pursuant to Section 10010 of the Elections Code.

(A) Topography.
(B) Geography.
(C) Cohesiveness, contiguity, integrity, and compactness of territory.
(D) Community of interests of the districts.
(2) The terms of office of the two members elected with the lowest vote shall expire on the Tuesday succeeding the next regular municipal election. At that election, members shall be elected by district in the even-numbered districts and shall hold office for four years.
(3) The terms of office of the three members elected with the highest vote shall expire on the Tuesday succeeding the second regular municipal election following the incorporation. At that election, members shall be elected by district in the odd-numbered districts and shall hold office for four years.

An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall include a declaration that the change in the method of electing members of the legislative body is being made in furtherance of the purposes of the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 14025) of Division 14 of the Elections Code).","Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city to submit to voters at any municipal or special election an ordinance providing for the election of members of the legislative body by districts, from districts, by districts with an elective mayor, or from districts with an elective mayor. Existing law also authorizes such an ordinance to be submitted to the voters by means of an initiative measure. Existing law requires that the ordinance state the number of legislative districts, describe the boundaries of each, number the districts, and state the method for electing the members of the legislative body, as described above.
This bill would delete the requirement that the ordinance describe the boundaries, and number, of each legislative district and would instead require the legislative body to prepare a proposed map describing the boundaries and numbers of the legislative districts after the ordinance is passed or enacted, as specified. The bill would require a legislative body changing from a from district method of election to a by district method of election, or adjusting the district boundaries, to hold public hearings on the change or adjustments, as specified. The bill would also make numerous technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
Existing law applies certain procedures if a majority of votes on the subject of incorporating a new city are in favor of incorporation and in favor of a by district method of election, including, among other things, requiring the boundaries of the districts of the legislative body to be as nearly equal in population as possible.
This bill would also require the districts to comply with applicable provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city with a population of fewer than 100,000 people to adopt an ordinance that requires the members of the legislative body to be elected by district or by district with an elective mayor without submitting the ordinance for voter approval.

At the time a tax official makes the request, he or she shall provide the person whose information is the subject of the request, with a copy of the affidavit and, upon request, make the information obtained available to that person.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2019, a city that has entered into a reciprocal agreement, as defined, with the Franchise Tax Board to exchange tax information, as provided. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2019, upon the request of the Franchise Tax Board, each city that assesses a city business tax or requires a city business license to annually submit to the board specified information relating to the administration of the city’s business tax program. Existing law defines the term “city” to include, among others, a city and county. Existing law limits the collection and use of this information and provides that any unauthorized use of this information is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would expand these provisions to additionally apply to a county. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

A city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity may not file a claim within the small claims division if the amount of the demand exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000).","Existing law establishes a small claims division, known as a small claims court, in each superior court.

SECTION 1.
Section 4689 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
4689.
Consistent with state and federal law, the Legislature places a high priority on providing opportunities for adults with developmental disabilities, regardless of the degree of disability, to live in homes that they own or lease with support available as often and for as long as it is needed, when that is the preferred objective in the individual program plan. In order to provide opportunities for adults to live in their own homes, the following procedures shall be adopted:

(1) Consumers shall be supported in living arrangements
which
that
are typical of those in which persons without disabilities reside.

(7) Services and supports are most effective when furnished where a person lives and within the context of his or her day-to-day activities.
(8) Consumers shall not be excluded from supported living arrangements based solely on the nature and severity of their disabilities.
(b) Regional centers may contract with agencies or individuals to assist consumers in securing their own homes and to provide consumers with the supports needed to live in their own homes.
(c) The range of supported living services and supports available include, but are not limited to, assessment of consumer needs; assistance in finding,

(d) Regional centers shall provide information and education to consumers and their families about supported living principles and services.
(e) Regional centers shall monitor and ensure the quality of services and supports provided to individuals living in homes that they own or lease. Monitoring shall take into account all of the following:

(3) Whether services and supports described in the consumer’s individual program plan are being delivered.
(4) Whether services and supports are having the desired effects.
(5) Whether the consumer is satisfied with the services and supports.
(f) The planning team, established pursuant to subdivision (j) of Section 4512, for a consumer receiving supported living services shall confirm that all appropriate and available sources of natural and generic supports have been utilized to the fullest extent possible for that consumer.
(g) Regional centers shall utilize the same supported living provider for consumers who reside in the same domicile, provided that each individual consumer’s particular needs can still be met pursuant to his or her individual program plans.
(h) Rent, mortgage, and lease payments of a supported living home and household expenses shall be the responsibility of the consumer and any roommate who resides with the consumer.
(i) A regional center shall not make rent, mortgage, or lease payments on a supported living home, or pay for household expenses of consumers receiving supported living services, except under the following circumstances:
(1) If all of the following conditions are met, a regional center may make rent, mortgage, or lease payments as follows:
(A) The regional center executive director verifies in writing that making the rent, mortgage, or lease payments or paying for household expenses is required to meet the specific care needs unique to the individual consumer as set forth in an addendum to the consumer’s individual program plan, and is required when a consumer’s demonstrated medical, behavioral, or psychiatric condition presents a health and safety risk to himself or herself, or another.
(B) During the time period that a regional center is making rent, mortgage, or lease payments, or paying for household expenses, the supported living services vendor shall assist the consumer in accessing all sources of generic and natural supports consistent with the needs of the consumer.
(C) The regional center shall not make rent, mortgage, or lease payments on a supported living home or pay for household expenses for more than six months, unless the regional center finds that it is necessary to meet the individual consumer’s particular needs pursuant to the consumer’s individual program plan. The regional center shall review a finding of necessity on a quarterly basis and the regional center executive director shall annually verify in an addendum to the consumer’s individual program plan that the requirements set forth in subparagraph (A) continue to be met.
(2) A regional center that has been contributing to rent, mortgage, or lease payments or paying for household expenses prior to July 1, 2009, shall at the time of development, review, or modification of a consumer’s individual program plan determine if the conditions in paragraph (1) are met. If the planning team determines that these contributions are no longer appropriate under this section, a reasonable time for transition, not to exceed six months, shall be permitted.
(j) All paid roommates and live-in support staff in supported living arrangements in which regional centers have made rent, mortgage, or lease payments, or have paid for household expenses pursuant to subdivision (i) shall pay their share of the rent, mortgage, or lease payments or household expenses for the supported living home, subject to the requirements of Industrial Welfare Commission Order No. 15-2001 and the Housing Choice Voucher Program, as set forth in Section 1437f of Title 42 of the United States Code.
(k) Regional centers shall ensure that the supported living services vendors’ administrative costs are necessary and reasonable, given the particular services that they are providing and the number of consumers to whom the vendor provides services. Administrative costs shall be limited to allowable costs for community-based day programs, as defined in Section 57434 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, or its successor.
(l) Regional centers shall ensure that the most cost effective of the rate methodologies is utilized to determine the negotiated rate for vendors of supported living services, consistent with Section 4689.8 and Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations.

These tasks shall only be shared to the extent they are permitted under the Labor Code and related regulations, including, but not limited to, Industrial Welfare Commission Minimum Wage Order No. 15. The planning team, as defined in subdivision (j) of Section 4512, at the time of development, review, or modification of a consumer’s individual program plan (IPP), for housemates currently in a supported living arrangement or planning to move together into a supported living arrangement, or for consumers who live with a housemate not receiving supported living services who is responsible for the task, shall consider, with input from the service provider, whether any tasks, such as meal preparation and cleanup, menu planning, laundry, shopping, general household tasks, or errands can appropriately be shared. If tasks can be appropriately shared, the regional center shall purchase the prorated share of the activity. Upon a determination of a reduction in services pursuant to this section, the regional center shall inform the consumer of the reason for the determination, and shall provide a written notice of fair hearing rights pursuant to Section 4701.
(p) (1) To ensure that consumers in or entering into supported living arrangements receive the appropriate amount and type of supports to meet the person’s choice and needs as determined by the IPP team, and that generic resources are utilized to the fullest extent possible, the IPP team shall complete a standardized assessment questionnaire at the time of development, review, or modification of a consumer’s IPP. The questionnaire shall be used during the individual program plan meetings, in addition to the provider’s assessment, to assist in determining whether the services provided or recommended are necessary and sufficient and that the most cost-effective methods of supported living services are utilized. With input from stakeholders, including regional centers, the department shall develop and post the questionnaire on its Internet Web site, and, by June 30, 2012, shall provide it to the regional centers.
(2) Supported living service providers shall conduct comprehensive assessments for the purpose of getting to know the consumer they will be supporting and developing a support plan congruent with the choices and needs of the individual and consistent with the principles of supported living set forth in this section and in Subchapter 19 (commencing with Section 58600) of Chapter 3 of Division 2 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. The independent assessment required by this paragraph is not intended to take the place of or repeat the service provider’s comprehensive assessment.
(3) Upon a determination of a reduction in services pursuant to this section, the regional center shall inform the consumer of the reason for the determination, and shall provide a written notice of fair hearing rights pursuant to Section 4701.
(4) Nothing in this section precludes the completion of an independent assessment.
(q) Direct care workers providing supported living services shall satisfactorily complete 15 hours of training in behavioral intervention within three months from the date the direct care worker was hired.","Existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, requires the State Department of Developmental Services to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports, including supported living services, to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law lists the range of supported living services and supports to include, among other things, recruiting, training, and hiring individuals to provide personal care and other assistance, and requires supported living service providers to conduct comprehensive assessments for the purpose of getting to know the consumer they will be supporting.
This bill would require direct care workers providing supported living services to satisfactorily complete 15 hours of training in behavioral intervention within 3 months from the date the provider was hired.","An act to amend Section 4689 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to developmental services."
476,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Research has shown that dual enrollment can be an effective means of improving the educational outcomes for a broad range of students.
(b) Dual enrollment has historically targeted high-achieving students; however, increasingly, educators and policymakers are looking toward dual enrollment as a strategy to help students who struggle academically or who are at risk of dropping out.
(c) Allowing a greater and more varied segment of high school pupils to take community college courses could provide numerous benefits to both the pupils and the state, such as reducing the number of high school dropouts, increasing the number of community college students who transfer and complete a degree, shortening the time to completion of educational goals, and improving the level of preparation of students to successfully complete for-credit, college-level courses.
(d) California should rethink its policies governing dual enrollment, and establish a policy framework under which school districts and community college districts could create dual enrollment partnerships as one strategy to provide critical support for underachieving students, those from groups underrepresented in postsecondary education, those who are seeking advanced studies while in high school, and those seeking a career technical education credential or certificate.
(e) Through dual enrollment partnerships, school districts and community college districts could create clear pathways of aligned, sequenced coursework that would allow students to more easily and successfully transition to for-credit, college-level coursework leading to an associate degree, transfer to the University of California or the California State University, or to a program leading to a career technical education credential or certificate.
(f) To facilitate the establishment of dual enrollment partnerships, the state should remove fiscal penalties and policy barriers that discourage dual enrollment opportunities. By reducing some of these restrictions, it will be possible to expand dual enrollment opportunities, thereby saving both students and the state valuable time, money, and scarce educational resources.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Toxic blooms of cyanobacteria in the waters of the state, including, but not limited to, coastal lakes, estuaries, rivers and streams, wetlands, and inland lakes and reservoirs, represent a threat to water supplies, human health, endangered wildlife, and recreational activities.
(b) Cyanobacteria are widespread bacteria that are capable of forming toxic blooms and super-blooms in the waters of the state.
(c) Degradation of watersheds, nutrient loading, increased water diversions, and climate change have been linked to the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms, with high toxin production noted regularly in lakes, rivers, and other waters of the state.
(d) The state’s waters are especially prone to toxic cyanobacterial blooms due to our warm climate, numerous water diversions, and stressed waterways.
(e) Cyanobacteria produce potent hepatotoxins and neurotoxins, collectively referred to as cyanotoxins. Microcystins are the most commonly found cyanotoxin in the state’s impacted waters. Other cyanotoxins, such as the neurotoxins anatoxin-a and saxitoxin, are also present in California’s waters, but, at present, little is known about them.
(f) Cyanotoxins are poisonous to humans, pets, livestock, birds, and other wildlife via ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure. A single dose of microcystin can cause prolonged toxicity by cycling repeatedly between the liver and intestines.
(g) Blooms of microcystins and other toxic cyanobacteria are occurring in waters throughout California, and are threatening our water supply and health. Areas with recurrent and worsening cyanotoxin pollution include the Klamath and Sacramento Rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (from the Sacramento Delta to San Francisco Bay), and Clear Lake. Pinto Lake, Copco Lake, Iron Gate Reservoir, and three segments of the Klamath River have been listed as impaired due to cyanobacteria. Bird deaths attributed to microcystins have also been reported from the Salton Sea.
(h) The Pinto Lake watershed is being evaluated for total maximum daily load (TMDL) regulation for microcystin, and was considered for remediation as an Environmental Protection Agency “superfund” site.
(i) California’s southern sea otters, a state and federally listed threatened species, have died from microcystin poisoning. The source of sea otter exposure appears to be microcystin-contaminated freshwater runoff and possibly contaminated prey species.
(j) Sea otters and humans eat some of the same marine foods that can concentrate microcystin in body tissues; hence, food safety is a public health concern. Freshwater and marine fish and shellfish have not been routinely tested for cyanotoxins in California and limited diagnostic testing is available.
(k) The state needs a coordinated multiagency effort to develop actions and projects that will prevent or mitigate toxic blooms and associated cyanotoxin pollution.

(b) The federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 specify that sex discrimination includes discrimination against a pupil based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from childbirth-related conditions.
(c) The federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 require a pupil with temporary medical conditions occasioned by pregnancy or related to recovery from childbirth to be treated the same as any other pupil with a temporary disability.
(d) The Sex Equity in Education Act (Article 4 (commencing with Section 221.5) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code) prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions, which includes discrimination against pregnant and parenting pupils.
(e) The regulations implementing the Sex Equity in Education Act prohibit educational institutions from applying any rule concerning a pupil’s actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats a pupil differently on the basis of sex.
(f) The Unruh Civil Rights Act (Section 51 of the Civil Code) prohibits businesses, including public schools, from discriminating based on sex, which includes discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.
(g) Denial of accommodations to a pupil who chooses to breast-feed or express breast milk while at school is prohibited sex discrimination.

Existing law provides that if a person is arrested and taken into custody, that person may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell. Existing law requires, among other things, that all persons conducting or otherwise present during a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search to be of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. Under existing law, a person who knowingly and willfully authorizes or conducts a strip, visual, or physical body cavity search in violation of the prescribed provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would additionally require that all persons within sight of the inmate during a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search be of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. The bill would extend the protections regarding the manner in which a strip search is conducted to all minors held in a juvenile detention facility. By expanding the definition of a crime, creating a new crime, and imposing additional requirements on local law enforcement, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to amend Section 4030 of, and to add Section 4031 to, the Penal Code, relating to searches."

246.
(a) An employee who, on or after July 1, 2015, works in California for the same employer for 30 or more days within a year from the commencement of employment is entitled to paid sick days as specified in this section.
(b) (1) An employee shall accrue paid sick days at the rate of not less than one hour per every 30 hours worked, beginning at the commencement of employment or the operative date of this article, whichever is later, subject to the use and accrual limitations set forth in this section.

(3) An employer may use a different accrual method, other than providing one hour per every 30 hours worked, provided that the accrual is on a regular basis so that an employee has no less than 24 hours of accrued sick leave or paid time off by the 120th calendar day of employment or each calendar year, or in each 12-month period.

(c) An employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick days beginning on the 90th day of employment, after which day the employee may use paid sick days as they are accrued.
(d) Accrued paid sick days shall carry over to the following year of employment. However, an employer may limit an employee’s use of accrued paid sick days to 24 hours or three days in each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period. This section shall be satisfied and no accrual or carry over is required if the full amount of leave is received at the beginning of each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period. The term “full amount of leave” means three days or 24 hours.
(e) An employer is not required to provide additional paid sick days pursuant to this section if the employer has a paid leave policy or paid time off policy, the employer makes available an amount of leave applicable to employees that may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as specified in this section, and the policy satisfies one of the following:

This section does not prohibit the employer from increasing the accrual amount or rate for a class of employees covered by this subdivision.
(3) Notwithstanding any other law, sick leave benefits provided pursuant to the provisions of Sections 19859 to 19868.3, inclusive, of the Government Code, or annual leave benefits provided pursuant to the provisions of Sections 19858.3 to 19858.7, inclusive, of the Government Code, or by provisions of a memorandum of understanding reached pursuant to Section 3517.5 that incorporate or supersede provisions of Section 19859 to 19868.3, inclusive, or Sections 19858.3 to 19858.7, inclusive of the Government Code, meet the requirements of this section.

The employee shall be entitled to use those previously accrued and unused paid sick days and to accrue additional paid sick days upon rehiring, subject to the use and accrual limitations set forth in this section.

If an employer provides unlimited paid sick leave or unlimited paid time off to an employee, the employer may satisfy this section by indicating on the notice or the employee’s itemized wage statement “unlimited.” The penalties described in this article for a violation of this subdivision shall be in lieu of the penalties for a violation of Section 226. This subdivision shall apply to employers covered by Wage Order 11 or 12 of the Industrial Welfare Commission only on and after January 21, 2016.

SEC. 3.
Section 247.5 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
247.5.
(a) An employer shall keep for at least three years records documenting the hours worked and paid sick days accrued and used by an employee, and shall allow the Labor Commissioner to access these records pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 1174. An employer shall make these records available to an employee in the same manner as described in Section 226. If an employer does not maintain adequate records pursuant to this section, it shall be presumed that the employee is entitled to the maximum number of hours accruable under this article, unless the employer can show otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, an employer is not obligated to inquire into or record the purposes for which an employee uses paid leave or paid time off.
SEC. 4.
The provisions of this measure are severable. If any provision of this measure or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
SEC. 5.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to clarify provisions of Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 245) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, for the purposes of ensuring an effective and smooth implementation of the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","(1) The Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 provides, among other things, that an employee who, on or after July 1, 2015, works in California for 30 or more days within a year from the commencement of employment is entitled to paid sick days for prescribed purposes, to be accrued at a rate of no less than one hour for every 30 hours worked.
This bill would require that the employee do that work for the same employer in order to qualify for accrued sick leave under these provisions. This bill would exclude a retired annuitant of a public entity, as specified, from the definition of employee under these provisions.
The bill would authorize an employer to provide for employee sick leave accrual on a basis other than one hour for each 30 hours worked, provided that the accrual is on a regular basis and the employee will have 24 hours of accrued sick leave available by the 120th calendar day of employment.
(2) Existing law entitles an employee to use accrued paid sick days beginning on the 90th day of employment. Existing law permits an employer to limit an employee’s use of paid sick days to 24 hours or 3 days in each year of employment. Existing law requires an employer to provide an employee with written notice of the amount of paid sick leave available, or paid time off leave an employer provides in lieu of sick leave, as specified. Existing law provides that an employer is not required to provide additional paid sick days if the employer has a paid leave policy or paid time off policy, the employer makes available an amount of leave for specified uses, and the policy either satisfies specified accrual, carry over, and use requirements or provides no less than 24 hours or 3 days of paid sick leave for each year of employment or calendar year or 12-month basis.
This bill would authorize an employer to limit an employee’s use of paid sick days to 24 hours or 3 days in each year of employment, a calendar year, or a 12-month period. This bill would, for specified industries, delay the application of the notice requirement. The bill would permit an employer who provides unlimited sick leave to its employees to satisfy notice requirements by indicating “unlimited” on the employee’s itemized wage statement. The bill would require an employer to calculate paid sick leave based upon an employee’s regular rate of pay, total wages divided by total hours worked in a 90-day period, or the wages for other forms of paid leave, as specified. The bill would provide that an employer is not required to reinstate accrued paid time off to an employee, rehired within one year of separation from employment, that was paid out at the time of termination, resignation, or separation. The bill would provide that an employer is not required to provide additional paid sick days if the employer has a paid leave policy or paid time off policy, the employer makes available an amount of leave applicable to employees for specified uses, and the policy satisfies specified accrual, carry over, and use requirements, or that provided paid sick leave or paid time off to employees before January 1, 2015, as specified, or that are provided pursuant to specified provisions of law or of a memorandum understanding that meet the requirements of these provisions.
(3) Existing law requires an employer to keep records for three years documenting the hours worked and paid sick days accrued and used by an employee and to make those records available to the Labor Commissioner upon request.
This bill would provide that the employer has no obligation to inquire into or record the purposes for which an employee uses sick leave or paid time off.
(4) The bill would specify that its provisions are severable and would also make technical and conforming changes.
(5) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 245.5, 246, and 247.5 of the Labor Code, relating to employment, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA establishes a procedure by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and a procedure for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings upon the filing of an action or proceeding challenging a lead agency’s action on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA.
The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 (Proposition 1), approved by the voters on the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of bonds in the amount of $7,120,000,000 pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program.
This bill would require the public agency, in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approvals for specified water storage projects funded, in whole or in part, by Proposition 1, to comply with specified procedures. Because a public agency would be required to comply with those new procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the public agency to concurrently prepare the record of proceedings for the project. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2016, to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings seeking judicial review of a public agency’s action in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting project approval for those projects that require the actions or proceedings, including any appeals therefrom, be resolved, to the extent feasible, within
270
370
days of the certification of the record of proceedings. The bill would prohibit a court from staying or enjoining those projects unless it makes specified findings.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 21168.6.7 to the Public Resources Code, relating to environmental quality."

An agency, department, or officer that calls a veterinarian pursuant to this subdivision shall notify the board of the investigation.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a regularly licensed veterinarian in good standing who is called from another state to attend to cases that are a part of an investigation described in paragraph (1) may provide veterinary medical care for animals that are affected by the investigation with a temporary shelter facility, and the temporary shelter facility shall be exempt from the registration requirement of Section 4853 if all of the following conditions are met:

(c) For purposes of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), the board may inspect temporary facilities established pursuant to this section.","Under existing law, the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, the Veterinary Medical Board licenses and regulates veterinarians and the practice of veterinary medicine. It is unlawful for any person to practice veterinary medicine in this state unless he or she holds a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked license issued by the board, except under specified circumstances, including when regularly licensed veterinarians are actually called from other states to attend cases in this state and do not open an office or appoint a place to do business within the state.
This bill would further specify, for purposes of that provision, that a regularly licensed veterinarian in good standing who is called from another state by a law enforcement agency or animal control agency to attend to cases that are a part of an investigation of an alleged violation of federal or state animal fighting or animal cruelty laws within a single geographic location shall be exempt from specified licensing requirements if the agency determines that it is necessary to call the veterinarian in order to conduct the investigation, as specified. The bill would require an agency, department, or officer that calls a veterinarian pursuant to these provisions to notify the board of the investigation. The bill would also authorize a veterinarian who is called from another state to care for animals that are affected by an investigation with a temporary shelter facility established only for the purpose of the investigation, which would be exempt from specified registration requirements if it meets specified conditions.","An act to amend Section 4830 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to veterinarians."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Recent public opinion research indicates that Californians, regardless of political party or income level, are worried about the costs of growing older. Two-thirds of respondents in the research said that they are apprehensive about being able to afford long-term care. Sixty-three percent of respondents worry as much about paying for long-term care as they do for their future health care.
(b) A majority of respondents could not afford more than three months of nursing home care at an average cost of six thousand dollars ($6,000) per month in California. About four in 10 respondents could not afford a single month of care at that rate. Among Latino voters, 88 percent said they do not have long-term care insurance or are not sure whether they are covered for supportive services like in-home care. Concerns about paying for long-term care cut across all income levels and all partisan affiliations.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation establishing a task force to explore the feasibility of developing and implementing a culturally competent statewide insurance program for long-term care services and supports.

(e) The task force shall do all of the following:
(1) Explore how a statewide long-term care insurance program could be designed and implemented to expand the options for people who are interested in insuring themselves against the risk of costs associated with functional or cognitive disability, and require long-term care, services, and supports.
(2) Explore options for the design of the program, including eligibility, enrollment, benefits, financing, administration, and interaction with the Medi-Cal program and other publicly funded resources. In exploring these options, the task force shall consider all of the following:
(A) Whether and how a long-term care insurance program could be included as a benefit in the state disability insurance program structure, possibly through a nominal increase in the payroll tax, and whether the program could be structured in the same manner as Paid Family Leave benefits.
(B) Allowing for enrollment in the program of working adults who would make voluntary premium contributions either directly or through payroll deductions through their employer.
(C) To the extent feasible, requiring a mandatory enrollment with a voluntary opt-out option.

(E) Helping individuals with functional or cognitive limitations remain in their communities by purchasing nonmedical services and supports such as home health care and adult day care.
(F) Helping offset the costs incurred by adults with chronic and disabling conditions. The program need not be designed to cover the entire cost associated with an individual’s long-term care needs.
(3) Evaluate how benefits under the program would be coordinated with existing private health care coverage benefits.
(4) Evaluate the demands on the long-term care workforce as the need for long-term care in California grows, and how the long-term care workforce can be prepared to meet those demands.
(5) Consider the establishment of a joint public and private system to make long-term care accessible to as many individuals within California as possible.
(6) Make recommendations related to key regulatory provisions necessary for the public to access existing long-term care insurance programs and participate in future long-term care insurance programs, whether those programs are recommended by the task force or otherwise.
(f) The department shall operate within its existing budgetary resources for purposes of implementing this section. Any governmental agency that participates in the task force shall operate within its existing budgetary resources for purposes of that participation.
(g) The task force shall recommend options for establishing a statewide long-term care insurance program and comment on the respective degrees of feasibility of those options in a report submitted to the commissioner, the Governor, and the Legislature on or before July 1, 2017. The report submitted to the Legislature shall be submitted in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(h) To ensure an adequate benefit within a solvent program, the department shall, no later than July 1, 2018, produce an actuarial report of the recommendations made by the task force pursuant to subdivision (g). The report shall be shared with and approved by the members of the task force. If approved the report shall be submitted to the Legislature in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(i) The commissioner may seek private funds for purposes of implementing this section.
(j) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2019, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law provides for the regulation of long-term care insurance by the Insurance Commissioner and prescribes various requirements and conditions governing the delivery of individual or group long-term care insurance in the state. Existing law establishes the California Partnership for Long-Term Care Program to link private long-term care insurance and health care service plan contracts that cover long-term care with the In-Home Supportive Services program and Medi-Cal and to provide Medi-Cal benefits to certain individuals who have income and resources above the eligibility levels for receipt of medical assistance, but who have purchased certified private long-term care insurance policies.
This bill would establish the Long Term Care Insurance Task Force in the Department of Insurance, chaired by the Insurance Commissioner or his or her designee, and composed of specified stakeholders and representatives of government agencies to examine the components necessary to design and implement a statewide long-term care insurance program, as specified.

CHAPTER  3. Minor Violations
39150.
(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is to establish an enforcement policy for violations of this division that the enforcement agency finds are minor when the danger they pose to, or the potential that they have for endangering, human health, safety, or welfare or the environment is taken into account.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to provide a more resource-efficient enforcement mechanism, faster compliance times, and the creation of a productive and cooperative working relationship between the state board, the districts, and the regulated community while maintaining protection of human
health and safety
health, safety, and welfare
and the environment.
(c)
The
Except as provided in Section 39154, the
state board and each district shall, for their respective jurisdictions, implement this chapter by adopting a regulation or a rule that classifies the types of violations of this division, or of the regulations, rules, standards, orders, permit conditions, or other requirements adopted pursuant to this division, that the state board or the district finds are minor violations in accordance with subdivision (d).
(d) In classifying the types of violations that are minor violations, the state board or the district shall consider all of the following factors:
(1) The magnitude of the violation.
(2) The scope of the violation.
(3) The severity of the violation.
(4) The degree to which a violation puts human health, safety, or welfare or the environment into jeopardy.
(5) The degree to which a violation could contribute to the failure to accomplish an important goal or program objective as established by this division.
(6) The degree to which a violation
may
could
make it difficult to determine if the violator is in compliance with other requirements of this division.
(e) For purposes of this chapter, a minor violation of this division shall not include any of the following:
(1) Any knowing, willful, or intentional violation of this division.
(2) Any violation of this division that enables the violator to benefit economically from noncompliance, either by realizing reduced costs or by gaining a competitive advantage.
(3) Any violation that is a chronic violation or that is committed by a recalcitrant violator.
(f) In determining whether a violation is chronic or a violator is recalcitrant, for purposes of paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer shall consider whether there is evidence indicating that the violator has engaged in a pattern of neglect or disregard with respect to the requirements of this division or the requirements adopted pursuant to this division.
39151.
For purposes of this chapter, “notice to comply” means a written method of alleging a minor violation that is in compliance with all of the following requirements:
(a) The notice to comply is written in the course of conducting an inspection by an authorized representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer. If testing is required by the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer to determine compliance, and the testing cannot be conducted during the course of the inspection, the representative of the state board or the district or an authorized or designated officer shall have a reasonable period of time to conduct the required testing. If, after the test results are available, the representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the issuance of a notice to comply is warranted, the representative or officer shall immediately notify the facility owner or operator in writing.
(b) A copy of the notice to comply is presented to a person who is an owner, operator, employee, or representative of the facility being inspected at the time that the notice to comply is written. If offsite testing is required pursuant to subdivision (a), a copy of the notice to comply may be mailed to the owner or operator of the facility.
(c) The notice to comply clearly states the nature of the alleged minor violation, a means by which compliance with the requirement cited by the state board’s or district’s representative or an authorized or designated officer may be achieved, and a time limit in which to comply, which shall not exceed 30 days.
(d) The notice to comply shall contain the information specified in subdivision (h) of Section 39152 with regard to the possible reinspection of the facility.
39152.
(a) An authorized representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer, who, in the course of conducting an inspection, detects a minor violation shall issue a notice to comply before leaving the site at which the minor violation is alleged to have occurred if the authorized representative finds that a notice to comply is warranted.
(b) A person who receives a notice to comply pursuant to subdivision (a) shall have the period specified in the notice to comply from the date of receipt of the notice to comply in which to achieve compliance with the requirement cited on the notice to comply. Within five working days of achieving compliance, the person who received the notice to comply shall sign the notice to comply and return it to the state board’s or district’s representative or an authorized or designated officer, stating that the person has complied with the notice to comply. A false statement that compliance has been achieved is a violation of this division pursuant to Section 42400.2 or 42402.2.
(c) A single notice to comply shall be issued for all minor violations cited during the same inspection and the notice to comply shall separately list each cited minor violation and the manner in which each minor violation may be brought into compliance.
(d) A notice to comply shall not be issued for any minor violation that is corrected immediately in the presence of the inspector. Immediate compliance in that manner may be noted in the inspection report, but the person shall not be subject to any further action by the state board’s or district’s representative or an authorized or designated officer.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (g), a notice to comply shall be the only means by which the state board’s or district’s representative or an authorized or designated officer shall cite a minor violation. The state board’s or district’s representative or an authorized or designated officer shall not take any other enforcement action specified in this division to enforce the minor violation against a person who has received a notice to comply if the person is in compliance with this section.
(f) If a person who receives a notice to comply pursuant to subdivision (a) disagrees with one or more of the alleged violations cited in the notice to comply, the person shall give written notice of appeal to the state board or district, which shall develop a process for reviewing and determining the disposition of the appeal.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a person fails to comply with a notice to comply within the prescribed period, or if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the circumstances surrounding a particular minor violation are such that immediate enforcement is warranted to prevent harm to
the public health or safety or to
human health, safety, or welfare or
the environment, the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer may take any needed enforcement action authorized by this division.
(h) A notice to comply issued to a person pursuant to this section shall contain a statement that the inspected facility may be subject to reinspection at any time. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the reinspection of a facility to ensure compliance or to ensure that minor violations cited in a notice to comply have been corrected.
(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer, on a case-by-case basis, from requiring a person subject to a notice to comply to submit reasonable and necessary documentation to support a claim of compliance by the person.
(j) Nothing in this section restricts the power of a city attorney, district attorney, county counsel, or the Attorney General to bring, in the name of the people of California, any criminal proceeding otherwise authorized by law. Furthermore, nothing in this section prevents the state board or district, or any representative of the state board or district, from cooperating with, or participating in, such a proceeding.
(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the circumstances surrounding a particular minor violation are such that the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to this division is warranted or required by federal law, in addition to issuance of a notice to comply, the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer shall assess a civil penalty in accordance with this division, if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer makes written findings that set forth the basis for the determination of the state board or district.
39153.
On or before January 1, 2020, the state board shall report to the Legislature on actions taken by the state board and the districts to implement this chapter and the results of that implementation. Each district shall provide the state board with the information that the state board requests to determine the degree to which the purposes described in subdivision (a) of Section 39150 have been achieved. The report shall be submitted consistent with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
39154.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Various economic studies have shown that the biggest burden on family incomes is the cost of housing and transportation. These two variables greatly affect the quality of life for Californians.
(b) Los Angeles County voters have recognized the importance of investing in a transportation network that is responsive to the needs of commuters and transit users and that facilitates the movement of goods in the region. Los Angeles County has three existing voter-approved sales tax measures for transportation projects administered by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).
(c) In 1980, voters in Los Angeles County approved Proposition A, a sales tax of one-half of 1 percent on most retail sales in Los Angeles County. The MTA returns 25 percent of Proposition A proceeds to the cities in Los Angeles County for transportation purposes. Thirty-five percent of Proposition A proceeds is required to be used for rail development while the remaining 40 percent is for discretionary purposes. Almost all of the discretionary portion is used to fund bus service provided by the MTA and 16 other municipal bus operators within Los Angeles County. The collection of the sales tax is ongoing.
(d) In 1990, voters in Los Angeles County approved Proposition C, an additional sales tax of one-half of 1 percent on retail sales in Los Angeles County. The MTA returns 20 percent of Proposition C proceeds to the cities in Los Angeles County for transportation purposes. Forty percent of the Proposition C proceeds is required to be used for construction and operation of the bus transit and rail system, 5 percent to expand rail and bus security, 10 percent for commuter
rail,
rail
and construction of transit centers, park and ride lots, and freeway bus stops, and 25 percent for transit-related improvements to freeways and state highways. The collection of the sales tax is ongoing.
(e) Most recently, voters in Los Angeles County approved Measure R in 2008. Measure R is an ordinance authorizing an additional sales tax of one-half of 1 percent to fund traffic relief and rail expansion according to an expenditure plan contained in the ordinance. Measure R became effective July 1, 2009, and will remain in effect for 30 years.
(f) MTA has been entrusted with the responsibility and has the voters’ confidence that it will protect and use the sales tax funding responsibly and according to the rules approved by the voters.
SEC. 2.
Section 130350.7 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:
130350.7.
(a) The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), in addition to any other tax it is authorized to impose or has imposed, may impose a transactions and use tax at the rate of 0.5 percent, for a period not to exceed 30 years, that is applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles.
(b) The ordinance imposing the tax shall contain all of the following:
(1) An expenditure plan that lists the transportation projects and programs to be funded from net revenues from the tax. The expenditure plan shall appear in the ordinance as an exhibit. The expenditure plan shall include measures that ensure net revenues are shared equitably between regions of the county.
(2) Provisions conforming to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f).
(3) A provision limiting the MTA’s costs of administering the ordinance and the net revenues from the tax to 1.5 percent of the total tax revenues.
(4) A requirement that the net revenues from the tax, defined to mean the total tax revenues less any refunds, costs of administration by the State Board of Equalization, and the MTA’s administration costs, shall be used by the MTA to fund transportation projects and programs identified in the expenditure plan.
(5) A requirement that the MTA, during the period that the ordinance is operative, allocate
____
20
percent of all net revenues derived from the tax for bus operations. These revenues shall be allocated to all eligible and included municipal transit operators in the County of Los Angeles and to the MTA, in accordance with Section 99285. However, the allocations to the MTA and eligible and included municipal operators shall be made solely from revenues derived from a tax imposed pursuant to this section, and not from local discretionary sources. Funds allocated by MTA to itself pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant funds from any other source allocated by MTA to itself for public transit operations. Funds allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant any funds authorized by other provisions of law and allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators for public transit. In addition to this amount, the MTA shall allocate
____
5
percent of all net revenues derived from the tax for rail operations.
(c) The MTA shall notify the Legislature prior to the adoption of amendments to the adopted expenditure plan.
(d) The ordinance shall be adopted by the MTA board, which shall also adopt a resolution that submits the ordinance to the voters.
(e) The ordinance shall become operative pursuant to Section 130352 if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2 of Article XIII C of the California Constitution.
(f) The MTA may incur bonded indebtedness payable from the net revenues of the tax pursuant to the bond issuance provisions of this chapter and any successor act.
(g) The tax authorized by this section shall be imposed pursuant to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), notwithstanding the combined rate limitation in Section 7251.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.","Existing law authorizes the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose, in addition to any other tax that it is authorized to impose, a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5% for the funding of specified transportation-related projects and programs, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval. Existing law authorizes the MTA to seek voter approval to extend the transactions and use tax pursuant to an amended ordinance, subject to various requirements, including adoption of an amended expenditure plan that, among other things, updates certain cost estimates and identifies expected completion dates for projects and programs under the previous expenditure plan, and also requires the amended expenditure plan to be included in an updated long range transportation plan, as specified.
This bill would authorize the MTA to impose an additional transportation transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5%, for a period not to exceed 30 years, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval.
The Transactions and Use Tax Law limits to 2% the combined rate of all transactions and use taxes imposed in any county, with certain exceptions.

The political subdivision shall also hold at least two additional hearings over a period of no more than 45 days, at which the public is invited to provide input regarding the content of the draft map or maps and the proposed sequence of elections, if applicable. The first version of a draft map shall be published at least seven days before consideration at a hearing. If a draft map is revised at or following a hearing, it shall be published and made available to the public for at least seven days before being adopted.
(b) In determining the final sequence of the district elections conducted in a political subdivision in which members of the governing body will be elected at different times to provide for staggered terms of office, the governing body shall give special consideration to the purposes of the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 14025) of Division 14 of this code), and it shall take into account the preferences expressed by members of the districts.
(c) This section applies to, but is not limited to, a proposal that is required due to a court-imposed change from an at-large method of election to a district-based election.
(d) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “At-large method of election” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 14026.
(2) “District-based election” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 14026.
(3) “Political subdivision” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (c) of Section 14026.
(e) (1) Before commencing an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028, a prospective plaintiff shall send by certified mail a written notice to the clerk of the political subdivision against which the action would be brought asserting that the political subdivision’s method of conducting elections may violate the California Voting Rights Act.
(2) A prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 within 45 days of the political subdivision’s receipt of the written notice described in paragraph (1).
(3) (A) Before receiving a written notice described in paragraph (1), or within 45 days of receipt of a notice, a political subdivision may pass a resolution outlining its intention to transition from at-large to district-based elections, specific steps it will undertake to facilitate this transition, and an estimated time frame for doing so.
(B) If a political subdivision passes a resolution pursuant to subparagraph (A), a prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 within 90 days of the resolution’s passage.
(f) (1) If a political subdivision adopts an ordinance establishing district-based elections pursuant to subdivision (a), a prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice pursuant to subdivision (e) before the political subdivision passed its resolution of intention may, within 30 days of the ordinance’s adoption, demand reimbursement for the cost of the work product generated to support the notice. A prospective plaintiff shall make the demand in writing and shall substantiate the demand with financial documentation, such as a detailed invoice for demography services. A political subdivision may request additional documentation if the provided documentation is insufficient to corroborate the claimed costs. A political subdivision shall reimburse a prospective plaintiff for reasonable costs claimed, or in an amount to which the parties mutually agree, within 45 days of receiving the written demand, except as provided in paragraph (2). In all cases, the amount of the reimbursement shall not exceed the cap described in paragraph (3).
(2) If more than one prospective plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement, the political subdivision shall reimburse the prospective plaintiffs in the order in which they sent a written notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), and the 45-day time period described in paragraph (1) shall apply only to reimbursement of the first prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice. The cumulative amount of reimbursements to all prospective plaintiffs shall not exceed the cap described in paragraph (3).
(3) The amount of reimbursement required by this section is capped at $30,000, as adjusted annually to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. city average, as published by the United States Department of Labor.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law provides for political subdivisions that encompass areas of representation within the state. With respect to these areas, public officials are generally elected by all of the voters of the political subdivision (at-large) or by districts formed within the political subdivision (district-based). Existing law requires a political subdivision, as defined, that changes from an at-large method of election to a district-based election to hold at least 2 public hearings on a proposal to establish the district boundaries of the political subdivision before a public hearing at which the governing body of the political subdivision votes to approve or defeat the proposal.
This bill would instead require a political subdivision that changes to, or establishes, district-based elections to hold public hearings before and after drawing a preliminary map or maps of the proposed district boundaries, as specified.
Existing law, the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA), prohibits the use of an at-large method of election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice or otherwise influence the outcome of an election. The CVRA provides that a voter who is a member of a protected class may bring an action in superior court to enforce its provisions.
This bill would require a prospective plaintiff under the CVRA to first send a written notice to the political subdivision against which the action would be brought indicating that the method of election used by the political subdivision may violate the CVRA. The bill would permit the political subdivision to take ameliorative steps to correct the alleged violation before the prospective plaintiff commences litigation, and it would stay the prospective plaintiff’s ability to file suit for a prescribed amount of time. This bill would also permit a prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice, as described, to recover from the political subdivision reasonable costs incurred in supporting the written notice.
Because the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 10010 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

In order for the unarmored threespine stickleback habitat restoration project on Bouquet Creek in Bouquet Canyon proposed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to receive a take permit from the Department of Fish and Wildlife so that this project may begin as soon as possible, it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.","Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of any fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the unarmored threespine stickleback as a fully protected fish. The California Endangered Species Act prohibits the taking of an endangered or threatened species, except as specified. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may authorize the take of listed species if the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts are minimized and fully mitigated.
This bill would permit the department to authorize, under the California Endangered Species Act, the take of the unarmored threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus williamsoni) resulting from impacts attributable to the habitat restoration project to restore, maintain, and improve riparian habitat on public lands in a prescribed portion of Bouquet Creek and projects to restore the flow capacity to Bouquet Creek in Bouquet Canyon on public lands, as specified, if certain conditions are satisfied.

(b) The state has a compelling interest in ensuring the welfare of the residents of its communities through the maintenance of health and safety standards in grocery establishments.
(c) Experienced grocery retail workers with knowledge of proper sanitation procedures, health regulations and laws, and an experience-based understanding of the clientele and communities in which the retailer is located are essential in furthering this interest and the state’s investments in health and safety.
(d) A transitional retention period for grocery retail workers upon change of ownership, control, or operation of grocery stores ensures stability throughout the state for these vital workers, which, in turn, results in preservation of health and safety standards.

(c) If the successor grocery employer extends an offer of employment to an eligible grocery worker pursuant to this part, the successor grocery employer shall retain written verification of that offer for at least three years after the date of the offer. The verification shall include the name, address, date of hire, and employment occupation classification of each eligible grocery worker.
2506.
(a) A successor grocery employer shall retain each eligible grocery worker hired pursuant to this part for at least 90 days after the eligible grocery worker’s employment commencement date. During this 90-day transition employment period, eligible grocery workers shall be employed under the terms and conditions established by the successor grocery employer and pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any.
(b) If, within the period established in subdivision (b) of Section 2504, the successor grocery employer determines that it requires fewer eligible grocery workers than were required by the incumbent grocery employer, the successor grocery employer shall retain eligible grocery workers by seniority within each job classification to the extent that comparable job classifications exist or pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any. Nonclassified eligible grocery workers shall be retained by seniority and according to experience or pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any.
(c) During the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer shall not discharge without cause an eligible grocery worker retained pursuant to this part.
(d) At the end of the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer shall make a written performance evaluation for each eligible grocery worker retained pursuant to this part.

2512.
Parties subject to this part may, by collective bargaining agreement, provide that the agreement supersedes the requirements of this part.
2516.
This part shall not apply to grocery establishments that will be located in geographic areas designated by the United States Department of Agriculture as a food desert, based on the original food desert measure contained in the Food Access Research Atlas, provided that both of the following apply:

(b) The grocery establishment stocks and during normal business hours sells fresh fruit and vegetables in amounts and of a quality that is comparable to what the establishment sells in its three geographically closest stores, which are located outside of the food desert.
2518.
This part shall not be construed to limit an eligible grocery worker’s right to bring legal action for wrongful termination.
2520.
This part does not preempt any city, county, or city and county ordinances that provide equal or greater protection to eligible grocery workers.
2522.
The provisions of this part are severable. If any provision of this part or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.","Existing law regulates various aspects of the workplace and employee safety and health.
This bill, upon a change in control of a grocery establishment, would require an incumbent grocery employer to prepare a list of specified eligible grocery workers for a successor grocery employer, and would require the successor grocery employer to hire from this list during a 90-day transition period. The bill would require the successor grocery employer to retain eligible grocery workers for a 90-day period, prohibit the successor grocery employer from discharging those workers without cause during that period, and, upon the close of that period, require the successor grocery employer to consider offering continued employment to those workers. The bill would exempt a grocery establishment located in a food desert from the bill’s requirements, as provided. The bill would provide that a collective bargaining agreement may supersede these requirements and that these provisions do not preempt any local ordinances that provide equal or greater protection to eligible grocery workers.
This bill would provide that its provisions are severable.","An act to add Part 9.5 (commencing with Section 2500) to Division 2 of the Labor Code, relating to grocery workers."

Section 712 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:
712.
(a) The commission shall convene, or continue, until August 26, 2025, an independent peer review panel to conduct an independent review of enhanced seismic studies and surveys of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, including the surrounding areas of the facility and areas of nuclear waste storage.
(b) The independent peer review panel shall contract with the Energy Commission, the California Geological Survey of the Department of Conservation, the California Coastal Commission, the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission, the Office of Emergency Services, and the County of San Luis Obispo to participate on the panel and provide expertise.
(c) The independent peer review panel shall review the seismic studies and hold public meetings.
(d) The commission shall make reports by the independent peer review panel publicly available on the Internet Web site maintained by the commission.
SEC. 3.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
The Public Utilities Commission in Decision 10-08-003 (August 12, 2010) convened an independent peer review panel to review the seismic studies conducted on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company relative to the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant. The independent peer review panel, in addition to providing valuable expertise to the commission in evaluating the seismic studies, also operates to assure the public that the seismic studies are being performed in an appropriate manner. Because (1) the commission’s current contracts for the independent peer review panel are set to expire on November 30, 2015, the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant is authorized to operate until August 26, 2025, by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there continues to be enhanced seismic studies and surveys conducted that warrant review by the independent peer review panel to ensure the safety of the public, and (2) continuing the Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account beyond the July 1, 2019, expiration date is vital to provide the public assurance that the maintenance of the state’s nuclear emergency programs is in place, and will provide certainty for emergency planning and response preparedness should an emergency occur, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, authorizes local government entities to create disaster councils by ordinance and in turn develop disaster plans specific to their jurisdictions. Existing law, the Radiation Protection Act of 1999, requires local governments to develop and maintain radiological emergency preparedness and response plans to safeguard the public in the emergency planning zone around a nuclear powerplant, and generally makes the Office of Emergency Services responsible for the coordination and integration of all emergency planning programs and response plans created pursuant to the Radiation Protection Act of 1999. The California Emergency Services Act, until July 1, 2019, prescribes a method for funding state and local costs for carrying out these activities that are not reimbursed by federal funds, with the costs borne by utilities operating nuclear powerplants with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more.
This bill, operative July 1, 2019, would extend, until August 26, 2025, the method for funding state and local costs for emergency service activities associated with a nuclear powerplant, as described above, with respect to a utility operating a nuclear powerplant with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more, thereby extending an amount, as specified, available for disbursement for local costs for the Diablo Canyon site.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires the commission, for purposes of establishing rates for any electrical corporation, to disallow expenses reflecting the direct or indirect costs resulting from any unreasonable error or omission relating to the planning, construction, or operation of any portion of the corporation’s plant which cost, or is estimated to have cost, more than $50,000,000, including any expenses resulting from delays caused by any unreasonable error or omission. For these purposes, “planning” includes activities related to the initial and subsequent assessments of the need for a plant construction project and includes investigation and interpretation of environmental factors such as seismic conditions.
This bill would require the commission to convene, or continue, until August 26, 2025, an independent peer review panel to conduct an independent review of enhanced seismic studies and surveys of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, including the surrounding areas of the facility and areas of nuclear waste storage.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add and repeal Section 8610.5 of the Government Code, and to add Section 712 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

that
contains the provisions required by Section 33670, is either: (A) adopted on or after January 1, 1994, including later amendments to these redevelopment plans; or (B) adopted prior to January 1, 1994, but amended, after January 1, 1994, to include new territory. For plans amended after January 1, 1994, only the tax increments from territory added by the amendment shall be subject to this section. All the amounts calculated pursuant to this section shall be calculated after the amount required to be deposited in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund pursuant to Sections 33334.2, 33334.3, and 33334.6 has been deducted from the total amount of tax increment funds received by the agency in the applicable fiscal year.
(2) The payments made pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any amounts the affected taxing entities receive pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 33670. The payments made pursuant to this section to the affected taxing entities, including the community, shall be allocated among the affected taxing entities, including the community if the community elects to receive payments, in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity, including the community, receives during the fiscal year the funds are allocated, which percentage share shall be determined without regard to any amounts allocated to a city, a city and county, or a county pursuant to Sections 97.68 and 97.70 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and without regard to any allocation reductions to a city, a city and county, a county, a special district, or a redevelopment agency pursuant to Sections 97.71, 97.72, and 97.73 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 33681.12. The agency shall reduce its payments pursuant to this section to an affected taxing entity by any amount the agency has paid, directly or indirectly, pursuant to Section 33445, 33445.5, 33445.6, 33446, or any other provision of law other than this section for, or in connection with, a public facility owned or leased by that affected taxing agency, except: (A)  any amounts the agency has paid directly or indirectly pursuant to an agreement with a taxing entity adopted prior to January 1, 1994; or (B)  any amounts that are unrelated to the specific project area or amendment governed by this section. The reduction in a payment by an agency to a school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, shall be subtracted only from the amount that otherwise would be available for use by those entities for educational facilities pursuant to paragraph (4). If the amount of the reduction exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been available for use for educational facilities in any one year, the agency shall reduce its payment in more than one year.
(3) If an agency reduces its payment to a school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, the agency shall do all of the following:
(A) Determine the amount of the total payment that would have been made without the reduction.

which:
that:
(i) would have been considered property taxes; and (ii) would have been available to be used for educational facilities pursuant to paragraph (4).
(C) Reduce the amount available to be used for educational facilities.
(D) Send the payment to the school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, with a statement that the payment is being reduced and including the calculation required by this subdivision showing the amount to be considered property taxes and the amount, if any, available for educational facilities.
(4) (A) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to school districts, 43.3 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 42238 of the Education Code, as it read on January 1, 2013, and paragraph (1) of subdivision (j) of Section 42238.02 of the Education Code, and 56.7 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011–12 fiscal year through the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.
(B) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to community college districts, 47.5 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 84751 of the Education Code, and 52.5 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011–12 fiscal year through the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.
(C) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to county offices of education, 19 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 2558 of the Education Code, as it read on January 1, 2013, and Section 2575 of the Education Code, and 81 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011–12 fiscal year through the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.
(D) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section for special education, 19 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 56712 of the Education Code, and 81 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for education facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011–12 fiscal year through the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.
(E) If, pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3), an agency reduces its payments to an educational entity, the calculation made by the agency pursuant to paragraph (3) shall determine the amount considered to be property taxes and the amount available to be used for educational facilities in the year the reduction was made.
(5) Local education agencies that use funds received pursuant to this section for school facilities shall spend these funds at schools that are: (A) within the project area, (B) attended by students from the project area, (C) attended by students generated by projects that are assisted directly by the redevelopment agency, or (D) determined by the governing board of a local education agency to be of benefit to the project area.
(b) Commencing with the first fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, including the community if the community elects to receive a payment, an amount equal to 25 percent of the tax increments received by the agency after the amount required to be deposited in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund has been deducted. In any fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, the community that has adopted the redevelopment project area may elect to receive the amount authorized by this paragraph.
(c) Commencing with the 11th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, other than the community
which
that
has adopted the project, in addition to the amounts paid pursuant to subdivision (b) and after deducting the amount allocated to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, an amount equal to 21 percent of the portion of tax increments received by the agency, which shall be calculated by applying the tax rate against the amount of assessed value by which the current year assessed value exceeds the first adjusted base year assessed value. The first adjusted base year assessed value is the assessed value of the project area in the 10th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increment revenues.
(d) Commencing with the 31st fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, other than the community
which
that
has adopted the project, in addition to the amounts paid pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) and after deducting the amount allocated to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, an amount equal to 14 percent of the portion of tax increments received by the agency, which shall be calculated by applying the tax rate against the amount of assessed value by which the current year assessed value exceeds the second adjusted base year assessed value. The second adjusted base year assessed value is the assessed value of the project area in the 30th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments.
(e) (1) Prior to incurring any loans, bonds, or other indebtedness, except loans or advances from the community, the agency may subordinate to the loans, bonds, or other indebtedness the amount required to be paid to an affected taxing entity by this section, provided that the affected taxing entity has approved these subordinations pursuant to this subdivision.
(2) At the time the agency requests an affected taxing entity to subordinate the amount to be paid to it, the agency shall provide the affected taxing entity with substantial evidence that sufficient funds will be available to pay both the debt service and the payments required by this section, when due.
(3) Within 45 days after receipt of the agency’s request, the affected taxing entity shall approve or disapprove the request for subordination. An affected taxing entity may disapprove a request for subordination only if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the agency will not be able to pay the debt payments and the amount required to be paid to the affected taxing entity. If the affected taxing entity does not act within 45 days after receipt of the agency’s request, the request to subordinate shall be deemed approved and shall be final and conclusive.
(f) (1) The Legislature finds and declares both of the following:
(A) The payments made pursuant to this section are necessary in order to alleviate the financial burden and detriment that affected taxing entities may incur as a result of the adoption of a redevelopment plan, and payments made pursuant to this section will benefit redevelopment project areas.
(B) The payments made pursuant to this section are the exclusive payments that are required to be made by a redevelopment agency to affected taxing entities during the term of a redevelopment plan.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a redevelopment agency shall not be required, either directly or indirectly, as a measure to mitigate a significant environmental effect or as part of any settlement agreement or judgment brought in any action to contest the validity of a redevelopment plan pursuant to Section 33501, to make any other payments to affected taxing entities, or to pay for public facilities that will be owned or leased to an affected taxing entity.
(g) As used in this section, a “local education agency” is a school district, a community college district, or a county office of education.","Existing law relating to redevelopment agencies provides for specified payments with respect to development project areas.

(a) (1) All applicants for, and recipients of, aid under this chapter shall ensure that all children in the assistance unit not required to be enrolled in school have received all age-appropriate immunizations, unless it has been medically determined that an immunization for a child is not appropriate or the applicant or recipient has filed with the county welfare department an affidavit that the immunizations are contrary to the applicant’s or recipient’s beliefs.
(2) In lieu of initially requesting verification of age-appropriate immunizations, the county may first verify whether each child described in paragraph (1) has received all age-appropriate immunizations by reviewing the California Immunization Registry established pursuant to Section 120440 of the Health and Safety Code. If the registry does not contain records of these immunizations, the county shall require the applicant or recipient to provide documentation that the immunizations have been performed, unless the applicant or recipient has filed an affidavit that the immunizations are contrary to his or her beliefs or has supplied documentation that it has been medically determined that an immunization is not appropriate.

SECTION 1.
Section 361.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
361.3.
(a) In any case in which a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to Section 361, preferential consideration shall be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative, regardless of the relative’s immigration status. In determining whether placement with a relative is appropriate, the county social worker and court shall
, on a case-by-case basis,
consider, but shall not be limited to,
consideration of
all the following factors:
(1) The best interest of the child, including special physical, psychological, educational, medical, or emotional needs.
(2) The wishes of the parent, the relative, and child, if appropriate.
(3) The provisions of Part 6 (commencing with Section 7950) of Division 12 of the Family Code regarding relative placement.
(4) Placement of siblings and half siblings in the same home, unless that placement is found to be contrary to the safety and well-being of any of the siblings, as provided in Section 16002.
(5) The good moral character of the relative and any other adult living in the home, including whether any individual residing in the home has a prior history of violent criminal acts or has been responsible for acts of child abuse or neglect.
(6) The nature and duration of the relationship between the child and the relative, and the relative’s desire to care for, and to provide legal permanency for, the child if reunification is unsuccessful.
(7) The ability of the relative to do the following:
(A) Provide a safe, secure, and stable environment for the child.
(B) Exercise proper and effective care and control of the child.
(C) Provide a home and the necessities of life for the child.
(D) Protect the child from his or her parents.
(E) Facilitate court-ordered reunification efforts with the parents.
(F) Facilitate visitation with the child’s other relatives.
(G) Facilitate implementation of all elements of the case plan.
(H) Provide legal permanence for the child if reunification fails.
However, any finding made with respect to the factor considered pursuant to this subparagraph and pursuant to subparagraph (G) shall not be the sole basis for precluding preferential placement with a relative.
(I) Arrange for appropriate and safe child care, as necessary.
(8) The safety of the relative’s home. For a relative to be considered appropriate to receive placement of a child under this section, the relative’s home shall first be approved pursuant to the process and standards described in subdivision (d) of Section 309.
In this regard, the Legislature declares that a physical disability, such as blindness or deafness, is no bar to the raising of children, and a county social worker’s determination as to the ability of a disabled relative to exercise care and control should center upon whether the relative’s disability prevents him or her from exercising care and control. The court shall order the parent to disclose to the county social worker the names, residences, and any other known identifying information of any maternal or paternal relatives of the child. This inquiry shall not be construed, however, to guarantee that the child will be placed with any person so identified. The county social worker shall initially contact the relatives given preferential consideration for placement to determine if they desire the child to be placed with them. Those desiring placement shall be assessed according to the factors enumerated in this subdivision. The county social worker shall document these efforts in the social study prepared pursuant to Section 358.1. The court shall authorize the county social worker, while assessing these relatives for the possibility of placement, to disclose to the relative, as appropriate, the fact that the child is in custody, the alleged reasons for the custody, and the projected likely date for the child’s return home or placement for adoption or legal guardianship. However, this investigation shall not be construed as good cause for continuance of the dispositional hearing conducted pursuant to Section 358.
(b) In any case in which more than one appropriate relative requests preferential consideration pursuant to this section, each relative shall be considered under the factors enumerated in subdivision (a). Consistent with the legislative intent for children to be placed immediately with a responsible relative, this section does not limit the county social worker’s ability to place a child in the home of an appropriate relative or a nonrelative extended family member pending the consideration of other relatives who have requested preferential consideration.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Preferential consideration” means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated.
(2) “Relative” means an adult who is related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of these persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. However, only the following relatives shall be given preferential consideration for the placement of the child: an adult who is a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling.
(d)
(1)
Subsequent to the hearing conducted pursuant to Section 358,
whenever a new placement of the child must be made,
consideration for placement shall again be given as described in this section to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable and who will fulfill the child’s reunification or permanent plan requirements. In addition to the factors described in subdivision (a), the county social worker shall
report and the court shall
consider
whether
all of the following factors:
(A) Whether
the relative has established and maintained a relationship with the
child.
child or is able and willing to do so.
(B) The length of time the child has been in his or her current placement.
(C) The relationship of the child with the current caregiver.
(D) The child’s progress toward permanency with that caregiver.
(E) The placement preference of the child.
(2) The Judicial Council shall adopt a rule of court on or before January 1, 2017, that implements this subdivision in regard to the consideration of relatives for placement subsequent to the hearing conducted pursuant to Section 358.
(e) If the court does not place the child with a relative who has been considered for placement pursuant to this section, the court shall state for the record the reasons placement with that relative was denied.
(f) (1) With respect to a child who satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (2), the department and any licensed adoption agency may search for a relative and furnish identifying information relating to the child to that relative if it is believed the child’s welfare will be promoted thereby.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) The child was previously a dependent of the court.
(B) The child was previously adopted and the adoption has been disrupted, set aside pursuant to Section 9100 or 9102 of the Family Code, or the child has been released into the custody of the department or a licensed adoption agency by the adoptive parent or parents.
(3) As used in this subdivision, “relative” includes a member of the child’s birth family and nonrelated extended family members, regardless of whether the parental rights were terminated, provided that both of the following are true:
(A) No appropriate potential caretaker is known to exist from the child’s adoptive family, including nonrelated extended family members of the adoptive family.

B of the California Constitution.
SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to ensure the best possible outcome for children removed from the physical custody of his or her parents.","Existing law, in cases in which a minor is
adjudged
alleged to be
a dependent child of the court on the ground that the minor has suffered abuse or neglect, allows the court to take the child from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian if there would be a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor if the minor were returned home, among other criteria. If a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents, existing law requires preferential consideration to be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative. Existing law requires that the best interest of the child be considered, among other specified factors, in making that determination.
Existing law also requires that, subsequent to the hearing on the proper disposition to be made of the child, whenever a new placement of the child must be made, consideration for placement again be given to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable, as specified.
This bill would
state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to ensure the best possible outcome for children removed from the physical custody of his or her parents.
require the county social worker and the court, when determining whether placement with a relative is appropriate, to consider the above-described factors on a case-by-case basis. The bill also would require that consideration for placement with a relative subsequent to the disposition hearing be given without regard to whether a new placement of a child must be made, and would direct the social worker to report and the court to consider additional enumerated factors in making this determination. By increasing the duties of county social workers, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt a rule of court on or before January 1, 2017, that implements these provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act

SECTION 1.
Section 1259 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
1259.
(a) (1) The Legislature finds and declares that California is becoming a land of people whose languages and cultures give the state a global quality. The Legislature further finds and declares that access to basic health care services is the right of every resident of the state, and that access to information regarding basic health care services is an essential element of that right.
(2) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that when language or communication barriers exist between patients and the staff of any general acute care hospital, arrangements shall be made for interpreters or bilingual professional staff to ensure adequate and speedy communication between patients and staff.
(b)  As used in this section:
(1)  “Interpreter” means a person fluent in English and in the necessary second language, who can accurately speak, read, and readily interpret the necessary second language, or a person who can accurately sign and read sign language. Interpreters shall have the ability to translate the names of body parts and to describe competently symptoms and injuries in both languages. Interpreters may include members of the medical or professional staff.
(2)  “Language or communication barriers” means:
(A)  With respect to spoken language, barriers that are experienced by individuals who are limited-English-speaking or non-English-speaking individuals who speak the same primary language and who comprise at least 5 percent of the population of the geographical area served by the hospital or of the actual patient population of the hospital. In cases of dispute, the state department shall determine, based on objective data, whether the 5 percent population standard applies to a given hospital.
(B)  With respect to sign language, barriers that are experienced by individuals who are deaf and whose primary language is sign language.
(c)  To ensure access to health care information and services for limited-English-speaking or non-English-speaking residents and deaf residents, licensed general acute care hospitals shall:
(1)  Review existing policies regarding interpreters for patients with limited-English proficiency and for patients who are deaf, including the availability of staff to act as interpreters.
(2)  (A) (i) Adopt and review annually a policy for providing language assistance services to patients with language or communication barriers. The policy shall include procedures for providing, to the extent possible, as determined by the hospital, the use of an interpreter whenever a language or communication barrier exists, except when the patient, after being informed of the availability of the interpreter service, chooses to use a family member or friend who volunteers to interpret. The procedures shall be designed to maximize efficient use of interpreters and minimize delays in providing interpreters to patients. The procedures shall ensure, to the extent possible, as determined by the hospital, that interpreters are available, either on the premises or accessible by telephone, 24 hours a day.
(ii) The hospital shall, on or before July 1, 2016, and every January 1 thereafter, make the updated policy and a notice of availability of language assistance services available to the public on its Internet Web site. The notice shall be in English and in the other languages most commonly spoken in the hospital’s service area. For purposes of this paragraph, the hospital shall make the notice available in the language of individuals who meet the definition of having a language barrier pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b); however, a hospital is not required to make the notice available in more than five languages other than English.
(B) (i) The hospital shall, on or before July 1, 2016, and every January 1 thereafter, transmit to the department a copy of the updated policy and shall include a description of its efforts to ensure adequate and speedy communication between patients with language or communication barriers and staff.
(ii) The department shall make the updated policy available to the public on its Internet Web site.
(3)  Develop, and post in conspicuous locations, notices that advise patients and their families of the availability of interpreters, the procedure for obtaining an interpreter and the telephone numbers where complaints may be filed concerning interpreter service problems, including, but not limited to, a T.D.D. number for the hearing impaired. The notices shall be posted, at a minimum, in the emergency room, the admitting area, the entrance, and in outpatient areas. Notices shall inform patients that interpreter services are available upon request, shall list the languages for which interpreter services are available, shall instruct patients to direct complaints regarding interpreter services to the state department, and shall provide the local address and telephone number of the state department, including, but not limited to, a T.D.D. number for the hearing impaired.
(4)  Identify and record a patient’s primary language and dialect on one or more of the following: patient medical chart, hospital bracelet, bedside notice, or nursing card.
(5)  Prepare and maintain as needed a list of interpreters who have been identified as proficient in sign language and in the languages of the population of the geographical area serviced who have the ability to translate the names of body parts, injuries, and symptoms.
(6)  Notify employees of the hospital’s commitment to provide interpreters to all patients who request them.
(7)  Review all standardized written forms, waivers, documents, and informational materials available to patients upon admission to determine which to translate into languages other than English.
(8)  Consider providing its nonbilingual staff with standardized picture and phrase sheets for use in routine communications with patients who have language or communication barriers.
(9)  Consider developing community liaison groups to enable the hospital and the limited-English-speaking and deaf communities to ensure the adequacy of the interpreter services.
(d)  Noncompliance with this section shall be reportable to licensing authorities.
(e)  Section 1290 shall not apply to this section.

A violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires those hospitals to adopt and review annually a policy for providing language assistance services to patients with language or communication barriers, as defined. Existing law requires a hospital to annually transmit to the department a copy of its updated policy and to include a description of its efforts to ensure adequate and speedy communication between patients with language or communication barriers and staff.
This bill would require a general acute care hospital and the department to make the hospital’s updated policy available annually to the public on their respective Internet Web sites. The bill would also require a general acute care hospital to post on its Internet Web site a notice, in English and in the other most commonly spoken languages in the hospital’s service area, of the availability of language assistance services. Because a violation of these provisions by a health facility would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, as amended by the DNA Act, requires a person who has been convicted of a felony offense to provide buccal swab samples, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand, and any blood specimens or other biological samples required for law enforcement identification analysis. Existing law makes these provisions retroactive, regardless of when the crime charged or committed became a qualifying offense.
This bill would expand these provisions to require persons convicted of specified
misdemeanors, if they have a prior conviction of other specified misdemeanors,
misdemeanors
to provide buccal swab samples, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand, and any blood specimens or other biological samples required for law enforcement identification analysis. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement agencies to collect and forward these samples, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law prohibits a judge from relieving a person of the separate administrative duty to provide specimens, samples, or print impressions required by the DNA Act if the person has been found guilty of an offense for which DNA collection is required. Existing law, added by Proposition 47, allows a person to petition the court for resentencing if he or she was convicted of a felony that was reduced to a misdemeanor by Proposition 47. Existing law requires the court to resentence the petitioner, unless the court determines that the person would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.
This bill would clarify that the prohibition on judges relieving a person of the duty to provide specimens, samples, or print impressions is not affected by resentencing under Proposition 47.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend

(4) After receiving a conditional voter registration, the
county
elections official shall process the registration, determine the registrant’s eligibility to register, and attempt to validate the information.
(5) If a conditional registration is deemed effective, the
county
elections official shall include the corresponding provisional ballot in the official canvass.
(e) The county elections official may offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting pursuant to this article on election day at satellite offices of the county elections office, in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (2) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (d).

2170.5.
(a) A person who completes a conditional voter registration pursuant to this article shall provide proof of residence in order to register to vote during the 14 days immediately preceding an election or on election day. Proof of residence shall include any of the following:
(1) A valid California driver’s license, driver’s instruction permit, or identification card.
(2) A valid student identification card with an identifying photograph.
(3) A tribal identification card with an identifying photograph and signature.
(4) Photo identification, which may include a driver’s license, state identification card, passport, military identification card, tribal identification card, or student identification card, and a current bill identifying the name and address of the registrant, which may include a utility bill due within 30 days of election day, a rent statement dated within 30 days of election day, or a current student fee statement.
(b) If a conditional voter registration is not deemed effective pursuant to this article, the elections official shall process the affidavit of registration pursuant to Sections 2102 and 2107 and, if the registrant meets all other eligibility requirements to register to vote, the registration shall be deemed effective in forthcoming elections.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes conditional voter registration, using an affidavit of registration, whereby a person is permitted to register to vote after the 15th day before an election or on election day, and cast a provisional ballot to be counted if the conditional voter registration is deemed effective. Existing law establishes the procedures and requirements for determining whether a conditional voter registration is deemed effective, requires the county elections official to offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting at its permanent offices, and authorizes the official to offer this registration and voting at satellite offices on election day.
This bill would require that a registrant provide proof of residence, as specified, in order for a conditional voter registration to be deemed effective. If a conditional voter registration is not deemed effective, the bill would require the elections official to process the affidavit of registration, as specified, and if all other eligibility requirements are met, would require the registration to be effective in forthcoming elections. By imposing additional duties on county election officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 2170 of, and to add Section 2170.5 to, the Elections Code, relating to elections."

56000.5.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that:
(1) Pupils with low-incidence disabilities, as a group, make up less than 1 percent of the total statewide enrollment for kindergarten through grade 12.
(2) Pupils with low-incidence disabilities require highly specialized services, equipment, and materials.
(b) The Legislature further finds and declares that:
(1) Deafness involves the most basic of human needs—the ability to communicate with other human beings. Many
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children use an appropriate communication mode, sign language, which may be their primary language, while others express and receive language orally and aurally, with or without visual signs or cues. Still others, typically young

hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children, lack any significant language skills. It is essential for the well-being and growth of

, deaf, and nonverbal
children that educational programs recognize the unique nature of deafness and ensure that all
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children have appropriate, ongoing, and fully accessible educational opportunities.
(2) It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal

(3) It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf

children have an education in which special education teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, assessors, administrators, and other special education personnel understand the unique nature of deafness and are specifically trained to work with
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal
pupils. It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children have an education in which their special education teachers are proficient in the primary language mode of those children.
(4) It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children, like all children, have an education with a sufficient number of language mode peers with whom they can communicate directly and who are of the same, or approximately the same, age and ability level.

hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children have an education in which their parents and, where appropriate,
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
people are involved in determining the extent, content, and purpose of programs.
(6)
Hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children would benefit from an education in which they are exposed to
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
role models.
(7) It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf
hard-of-hearing
, deaf, and nonverbal
children, like all children, have programs in which they have direct and appropriate access to all components of the educational process, including, but not limited to, recess, lunch, and extracurricular social and athletic activities.
(8) It is essential that
hard-of-hearing and deaf

The bill would authorize a complainant not satisfied with the school district’s or county superintendent of schools decision to file an appeal with the Superintendent of Public Instruction. If a school district or county superintendent of schools finds merit in the complaint, or the Superintendent finds merit in the appeal, the bill would require the school district or county superintendent of schools to provide a remedy, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts or county education officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would prohibit specified civil actions against a school district or county superintendent of schools relating to noncompliance with the physical education requirements unless the complainant first follows local complaint procedures, if any, or the Uniform Complaint Procedures, if no local complaint procedures exist.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(1) Allowing a person who is not a “disabled veteran,” as defined in paragraph (6) of subdivision (b) of Section 999 of the Military and Veterans Code, to perform the role of a “disabled veteran” within the California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program, would conflict with the intended purpose of the program by placing that person in competition with a “disabled veteran” for program benefits intended to meet the special needs of disabled veterans.
(2) The spouse or child of a disabled veteran may participate in the program without conflicting with the program’s intended purpose, if their participation is limited to either fulfilling existing contracts or providing for the orderly and equitable disposition of a certified disabled veteran business enterprise following the death or permanent medical disability of the business’ majority owner.
(3) Three years is sufficient time for the orderly and equitable disposition of a certified disabled veteran business enterprise following the death or permanent medical disability of the majority owner.

For the purposes of complying with Section 41 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following with respect to Sections 17053.50 and 23650 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:
(a) The specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax credits will achieve are as follows:
(1) Leveraging sixty million dollars ($60,000,000) in private investment.
(2) Creating thousands of engineering or construction jobs.
(3) Mitigating seismic damage to save lives.
(b) The detailed performance indicators for the Legislature to use when measuring whether the tax credits meet those specific goals, purposes, and objectives are as follows:
(1) The amount of private sector investment enabled by allocation of the tax credits.
(2) The number of engineering or construction jobs created as a result of this investment.

This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2022, would allow a tax credit under both laws in an amount equal to 30% of the qualified costs paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer for any seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building, as provided. The bill would require a taxpayer, in order to be eligible for the credit, to obtain 2 certifications from the appropriate jurisdiction with authority for building code enforcement of the area in which the building is located: one prior to seismic retrofit construction that certifies that the building is an at-risk property, and a second subsequent to construction that certifies that the completed construction is seismic retrofit construction, as defined, and specifies a dollar amount of qualified costs. The bill would further require the taxpayer to provide the second certification to and apply for allocation of the credit with the Franchise Tax Board, and would require the board to allocate credits on a first-come-first-served basis. The bill would provide that the credit would have an aggregate cap under both laws of $12,000,000 for each calendar year, as provided.
Existing law requires a bill that would authorize a new credit against the tax imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law or the Corporation Tax Law to contain specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the new credit will achieve and detailed performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the new credit achieves these goals, purposes, and objectives.
This bill would make findings specifying the goals, purposes, and objectives of the above-described tax credits and detailing the performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the credits meet these goals, purposes, and objectives.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","An act to add and repeal Sections 17053.50 and 23650 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy."

(2) That, by adding powers to the probate conservatorship for people with dementia, their unique and special needs can be met. This will reduce costs to the conservatee and the family of the conservatee, reduce costly administration by state and county government, and safeguard the basic dignity and rights of the conservatee.
(3) That it is the intent of the Legislature to recognize that the administration of psychotropic medications has been, and can be, abused by caregivers and, therefore, granting powers to a conservator to authorize these medications for the treatment of dementia requires the protections specified in this section.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a conservator may authorize the placement of a conservatee in a secured perimeter residential care facility for the elderly operated pursuant to Section 1569.698 of the Health and Safety Code, and which has a care plan that meets the requirements of Section 87705 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, upon a court’s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of all of the following:
(1) The conservatee has dementia, as defined in the last published edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.”
(2) The conservatee lacks the capacity to give informed consent to this placement and has at least one mental function deficit pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 811, and this deficit significantly impairs the person’s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 811.
(3) The conservatee needs or would benefit from a restricted and secure environment, as demonstrated by evidence presented by the physician or psychologist referred to in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f).
(4) The court finds that the proposed placement in a locked facility is the least restrictive placement appropriate to the needs of the conservatee.
(c) Notwithstanding any other law, a conservator of a person may authorize the administration of medications appropriate for the care and treatment of dementia, upon a court’s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of all of the following:
(1) The conservatee has dementia, as defined in the last published edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.”

(3) The petition shall be supported by a declaration of a licensed physician, or a licensed psychologist within the scope of his or her licensure, regarding each of the findings required to be made under this section for any power requested, except that the psychologist has at least two years of experience in diagnosing dementia.
(4) The petition may be filed by any of the persons designated in Section 1891.
(g) The court investigator shall annually investigate and report to the court every two years pursuant to Sections 1850 and 1851 if the conservator is authorized to act under this section. In addition to the other matters provided in Section 1851, the conservatee shall be specifically advised by the investigator that the conservatee has the right to object to the conservator’s powers granted under this section, and the report shall also include whether powers granted under this section are warranted. If the conservatee objects to the conservator’s powers granted under this section, or the investigator determines that some change in the powers granted under this section is warranted, the court shall provide a copy of the report to the attorney of record for the conservatee.

A petition for authority to act under these provisions requires, among other things, that the conservatee be represented by an attorney, as provided.
This bill would require the court, upon granting or denying that authority to a conservator, to either discharge the attorney or order continuation of the representation, as specified.","An act to amend Section 2356.5 of the Probate Code, relating to protective proceedings."

Existing law defines a model rocket engine as a commercially manufactured, nonreusable rocket propulsion device that is constructed of nonmetallic casing and solid propellant, as provided.
This bill would add to the definition of “model rocket” a requirement that it conform to the definition of “model rocket” as used in the 2013 edition of the “NFPA 1122: Code for Model Rocketry,” or a more recent edition as adopted by the State Fire Marshal, and would increase the maximum weight of a model rocket to not more than 1500 grams. This bill would change all references in statute to model rocket engines to instead refer to model rocket motors. The bill would revise the definition of “model rocket motor” to mean a rocket propulsion device using commercially manufactured solid propellant that does not require mixing by the user and that conforms to the definition of “model rocket motor” as used in the 2012 edition of the “NFPA 1125: Code for the Manufacture of Model Rocket and High Power Rocket Motors,” or a more recent edition as adopted by the State Fire Marshal.","An act to amend Sections 12519, 12520, 12565, 12602, 12632, 12634, 12640, 12688, and 12722 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to explosives."

SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Pool Safety Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Swimming pools provide children and their families with a wonderful opportunity for recreation, exercise, and fun. Keeping children safe during this activity is supported by parents and guardians, safety advocates, health providers, insurance companies, and the swimming pool industry.
(b) According to both the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and the State Department of Public Health’s EpiCenter data, drowning is the leading cause of death for California children one to four years of age, inclusive.
(c) Additional children suffer near-drowning incidents and survive, but many of those children suffer irreversible brain injuries, which can lead to lifelong learning deficiencies that impact not only the affected child and his or her family, but also the resources and moneys available to California’s health care system, regional centers, and special education school programs.
(d) Close parental supervision of children with access to swimming pools is essential to providing pool safety for children. Barriers, such as those required pursuant to Section 115922 of the Health and Safety Code, can help to deter young children from gaining unsupervised access to pools. Swimming lessons are encouraged and can help children understand the importance of water safety.
(e) All water sports activities come with risk. Knowing the risks and having drowning prevention strategies in place before and during water sports activities reduce drowning incidents, and the installation of a residential pool barrier is a leading strategy to further California’s goal of dramatically reducing unintentional injury.
SEC. 3.
Section 7195 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
7195.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
(a) (1) “Home inspection” is a noninvasive, physical examination, performed for a fee in connection with a transfer, as defined in subdivision (e), of real property, of the mechanical, electrical, or plumbing systems or the structural and essential components of a residential dwelling of one to four units designed to identify material defects in those systems, structures, and components. “Home inspection” includes any consultation regarding the property that is represented to be a home inspection or any confusingly similar term.
(2) In connection with a transfer, as defined in subdivision (e), of real property with a swimming pool or spa, a “home inspection” shall include a noninvasive physical examination of the pool or spa and dwelling for the purpose of identifying which, if any, of the seven drowning prevention safety features listed in subdivision (a) of Section 115922 of the Health and Safety Code the pool or spa is equipped with.
(3) “Home inspection,” if requested by the client, may include an inspection of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency items to be inspected may include the following:
(A) A noninvasive inspection of insulation R-values in attics, roofs, walls, floors, and ducts.
(B) The number of window glass panes and frame types.
(C) The heating and cooling equipment and water heating systems.
(D) The age and fuel type of major appliances.
(E) The exhaust and cooling fans.
(F) The type of thermostat and other systems.
(G) The general integrity and potential leakage areas of walls, window areas, doors, and duct systems.
(H) The solar control efficiency of existing windows.
(b) A “material defect” is a condition that significantly affects the value, desirability, habitability, or safety of the dwelling. Style or aesthetics shall not be considered in determining whether a system, structure, or component is defective.
(c) A “home inspection report” is a written report prepared for a fee and issued after a home inspection. The report clearly describes and identifies the inspected systems, structures, or components of the dwelling, any material defects identified, and any recommendations regarding the conditions observed or recommendations for evaluation by appropriate persons. In a dwelling with a pool or spa, the “home inspection report” shall identify which, if any, of the seven drowning prevention safety features listed in subdivision (a) of Section 115922 of the Health and Safety Code the pool or spa is equipped with and shall specifically state if the pool or spa has fewer than two of the listed drowning prevention safety features.
(d) A “home inspector” is any individual who performs a home inspection.
(e) “Transfer” is a transfer by sale, exchange, installment land sales contract, as defined in Section 2985 of the Civil Code, lease with an option to purchase, any other option to purchase, or ground lease coupled with improvements, of real property or residential stock cooperative, improved with or consisting of not less than one nor more than four dwelling units.
SEC. 4.
Section 115922 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
115922.
(a) Except as provided in Section 115925, when a building permit is issued for the construction of a new swimming pool or spa or the remodeling of an existing swimming pool or spa at a private single-family home, the swimming pool or spa shall be equipped with at least two of the following seven drowning prevention safety features:
(1) An enclosure that meets the requirements of Section 115923 and isolates the swimming pool or spa from the private single-family home.
(2) Removable mesh fencing that meets American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specifications F 2286 standards in conjunction with a gate that is self-closing and self-latching and can accommodate a key lockable device.
(3) An approved safety pool cover, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 115921.
(4) Exit alarms on the private single-family home’s doors that provide direct access to the swimming pool or spa. The exit alarm may cause either an alarm noise or a verbal warning, such as a repeating notification that “the door to the pool is open.”
(5) A self-closing, self-latching device with a release mechanism placed no lower than 54 inches above the floor on the private single-family home’s doors providing direct access to the swimming pool or spa.
(6) An alarm that, when placed in a swimming pool or spa, will sound upon detection of accidental or unauthorized entrance into the water. The alarm shall meet and be independently certified to the ASTM Standard F 2208 “Standards Specification for Pool Alarms,” which includes surface motion, pressure, sonar, laser, and infrared type alarms. A swimming protection alarm feature designed for individual use, including an alarm attached to a child that sounds when the child exceeds a certain distance or becomes submerged in water, is not a qualifying drowning prevention safety feature.
(7) Other means of protection, if the degree of protection afforded is equal to or greater than that afforded by any of the features set forth above and has been independently verified by an approved testing laboratory as meeting standards for those features established by the ASTM or the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
(b) Before the issuance of a final approval for the completion of permitted construction or remodeling work, the local building code official shall inspect the drowning safety prevention features required by this act and, if no violations are found, shall give final approval.
SEC. 5.
Section 115925 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
115925.
The requirements of this article shall not apply to any of the following:
(a) Public swimming pools.
(b) Hot tubs or spas with locking safety covers that comply with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM F1346).
(c) An apartment complex, or any residential setting other than a single-family home.
SEC. 6.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Swimming Pool Safety Act, provides that it does not apply to any pool within the jurisdiction of any political subdivision that adopts an ordinance for swimming pools, as specified. The act further requires, when a building permit is issued for construction of a new swimming pool or spa, or the remodeling of an existing pool or spa, at a private, single-family home, that the pool or spa be equipped with at least 1 of 7 drowning prevention safety features. The act requires the local building code official to inspect and approve the drowning safety prevention devices before the issuance of a final approval for the completion of permitted construction or remodeling work.
This bill would instead require, when a building permit is issued, that the pool or spa be equipped with at least 2 of the 7 drowning prevention safety features. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would remove the exemption for the above-described political subdivisions.
Existing law defines terms related to paid home inspections, establishes a standard of care for home inspectors, and prohibits certain inspections in which the inspector or the inspector’s employer, as specified, has a financial interest.
This bill would require a home inspection for real property with a swimming pool or spa to include a noninvasive physical examination of the pool or spa and dwelling for the purpose of identifying which, if any, of the specified 7 drowning prevention safety features the pool or spa is equipped with.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 7195 of the Business and Professions Code, and to amend Sections 115922 and 115925 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health."

SECTION 1.
Section 10072 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
10072.
The electronic benefits transfer system required by this chapter shall be designed to do, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(a) To the extent permitted by federal law and the rules of the program providing the benefits, recipients who are required to receive their benefits using an electronic benefits transfer system shall be permitted to gain access to the benefits in any part of the state where electronic benefits transfers are accepted. All electronic benefits transfer systems in this state shall be designed to allow recipients to gain access to their benefits by using every other electronic benefits transfer system.
(b) To the maximum extent feasible, electronic benefits transfer systems shall be designed to be compatible with the electronic benefits transfer systems in other states.
(c) All reasonable measures shall be taken in order to ensure that recipients have access to electronically issued benefits through systems such as automated teller machines, point-of-sale devices, or other devices that accept electronic benefits transfer transactions. Benefits provided under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 shall be staggered over a period of three calendar days, unless a county requests a waiver from the department and the waiver is approved, or in cases of hardship pursuant to subdivision (p).
(d) The system shall provide for reasonable access to benefits to recipients who demonstrate an inability to use an electronic benefits transfer card or other aspect of the system because of disability, language, lack of access, or other barrier. These alternative methods shall conform to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101, et seq.), including reasonable accommodations for recipients who, because of physical or mental disabilities, are unable to operate or otherwise make effective use of the electronic benefits transfer system.
(e) The system shall permit a recipient the option to choose a personal identification number, also known as a “PIN” number, to assist the recipient to remember his or her number in order to allow access to benefits. Whenever an institution, authorized representative, or other third party not part of the recipient household or assistance unit has been issued an electronic benefits transfer card, either in lieu of, or in addition to, the recipient, the third party shall have a separate card and personal identification number. At the option of the recipient, he or she may designate whether restrictions apply to the third party’s access to the recipient’s benefits. At the option of the recipient head of household or assistance unit, the county shall provide one electronic benefits transfer card to each adult member to enable them to access benefits.
(f) The system shall have a 24-hour per day toll-free telephone hotline for the reporting of lost or stolen cards that will provide recipients, at no additional cost to the recipient, with information on how to have the card and personal identification number replaced, and that will allow an authorized representative or head of household to access, over the telephone, the transaction history detail for at least the last 10 transactions and to request that the transaction history detail for at least the past two months be sent by mail.
(g) The system shall have an Internet Web site that will provide recipients, at no additional cost to the recipient, with information on how to have the card and personal identification number replaced, and that will allow an authorized representative or head of household to view the transaction history detail for at least the last 10 transactions and to request that the transaction history detail for at least the past two months be sent by mail.
(h) In addition to the ability to receive transaction history detail pursuant to subdivisions (f) and (g), a county human services agency shall make available to an authorized representative or head of household, at no additional cost to the authorized representative or head of household, all electronic benefit transaction history details that are available to the county human services agency within 10 business days after a request has been received by the agency.
(i) (1) A recipient shall not incur any loss of electronic benefits after reporting that his or her electronic benefits transfer card or personal identification number has been lost or stolen. The system shall provide for the prompt replacement of lost or stolen electronic benefits transfer cards and personal identification numbers. Electronic benefits for which the case was determined eligible and that were not withdrawn by transactions using an authorized personal identification number for the account shall also be promptly replaced.
(2) A recipient shall not incur any loss of cash benefits that are taken by an unauthorized withdrawal, removal, or use of benefits that does not occur by the use of a physical
EBT
electronic benefits transfer
card issued to the recipient or authorized third party to directly access the benefits. Benefits taken as described in this paragraph shall be promptly replaced in accordance with the protocol established by the department pursuant to paragraph (3).
(3) The State Department of Social Services shall establish a protocol for recipients to report electronic theft of cash benefits that minimizes the burden on recipients, ensures prompt replacement of benefits in order to minimize the harm to recipients, and ensures program integrity. This protocol may include the automatic replacement of benefits without the need for recipient reporting and verification.
(j) Electronic benefits transfer system consumers shall be informed
on
as to
how to use electronic benefits transfer cards, how to protect their cards from misuse, and where consumers can use their cards to withdraw benefits without incurring a fee, charge, or surcharge.
(k) The electronic benefits transfer system shall be designed to inform recipients when the electronic benefits transfer system does not function or is expected not to function for more than a one-hour period between 6 a.m. and midnight during any 24-hour period. This information shall be made available in the recipient’s preferred language if the electronic benefits transfer system vendor contract provides for services in that language.
(l) Procedures shall be developed for error resolution.
(m) No fee shall be charged by the state, a county, or an electronic benefits processor certified by the state to retailers participating in the electronic benefits transfer system.
(n) Except for CalFresh transactions, a recipient may be charged a fee, not to exceed the amount allowed by applicable state and federal law and customarily charged to other customers, for cash withdrawal transactions that exceed four per month.
(o) The electronic benefits transfer system shall be designed to ensure that recipients of benefits under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 have access to using or withdrawing benefits with minimal fees or charges, including an opportunity to access benefits with no fee or charges.
(p) A county shall exempt an individual from the three-day staggering requirement under subdivision (c) on a case-by-case basis for hardship. Hardship includes, but is not limited to, the incurrence of late charges on an individual’s housing payments.
(q) A county shall use information provided by the department to inform recipients of benefits under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 of all of the following:
(1) The methods of electronic delivery of benefits available, including distribution of benefits through the electronic benefits transfer system or direct deposit pursuant to Section 11006.2.
(2) Applicable fees and charges, including surcharges, consumer and privacy protections, and liability for theft associated with the electronic benefits transfer system.
(3) How to avoid fees and charges, including opting for delivery of benefits by direct deposit and using the electronic benefits transfer card solely at surcharge free locations.
(4) Where to withdraw benefits without a surcharge when using the electronic benefits transfer system.
(5) That a recipient may authorize any available method of electronic delivery of benefits and instructions regarding how the recipient may select or change his or her preferred method of electronic delivery of benefits and that the recipient shall be given the opportunity to select the method prior to the first payment.
(6) That a recipient may be entitled to an alternative method of delivery if the recipient demonstrates an inability to use an electronic benefits transfer card or other aspect of the system because of disability, language, lack of access, or other barrier pursuant to subdivision (d) and instructions regarding how to determine whether the recipient qualifies for an alternative method of delivery.
(7) That a recipient may be entitled to an exemption from the three-day staggering requirement under subdivision (c) on a case-by-case basis for hardship pursuant to subdivision (o) and instructions regarding how to determine whether the recipient qualifies for the exemption.
(r) A county is in compliance with subdivision (q) if it provides the recipient a copy of the information developed by the department. A county may provide a recipient information, in addition to the copy of the information developed by the department, pursuant to subdivision (q), either verbally or in writing, if the county determines the additional information will benefit the recipient’s understanding of the information provided.","Existing law, administered by the State Department of Social Services, provides for the establishment of a statewide electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system for the purpose of providing financial and food assistance benefits. Existing law authorizes a county to deliver CalFresh benefits and, upon election by the county, CalWORKs benefits through the use of an EBT system. Existing law requires, among other things, that a recipient not incur any loss of cash benefits that are taken by an unauthorized withdrawal, removal, or use of benefits that does not occur by the use of a physical EBT card issued to the recipient or authorized 3rd party to directly access the benefits.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","An act to amend Section 10072 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public social services."

(a) (1)A licensee shall not discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a complainant, patient, employee, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker of the long-term health care facility, on the basis or for the reason that the person has done either of the following:
(A)Presented a grievance, complaint, or report to the facility, to an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility or the medical staff of the facility, or to any other governmental entity.
(B)Initiated, participated, or cooperated in an investigation or administrative proceeding related to the quality of care, services, or conditions at the facility that is carried out by an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility or its medical staff, or any other governmental entity.

(3)A violation of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). The civil penalty shall be assessed and recovered through the same administrative process set forth in Chapter 2.4 (commencing with Section 1417).
(b) An attempt to expel a patient from a long-term health care facility, or any type of discriminatory treatment of a patient by whom, or upon whose behalf, a grievance or complaint has been submitted, directly or indirectly, to a governmental entity or received by a long-term health care facility administrator or any proceeding instituted under or related to this chapter within 180 days of the filing of the complaint or the institution of the action, shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the action was taken by the licensee in retaliation for the filing of the complaint.
(c) (1)An attempt to terminate the employment, or other discriminatory treatment, of an employee, complainant, patient, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker who has presented a grievance or complaint or has initiated, participated, or cooperated in an investigation or proceeding of a governmental entity as specified in subdivision (a), where the facility or licensee had knowledge of the employee, complainant, patient, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker’s initiation, participation, or cooperation, shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the action was taken by the licensee in retaliation if it occurs within 120 days of the filing of the grievance or complaint, or the institution of the action.
(2)For purposes of this section, discriminatory treatment of an employee, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker includes, but is not limited to, discharge, demotion, suspension, or an unfavorable change in, or breach of, the terms or conditions of a contract, employment, or privileges of the employee, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker of the health care facility, or the threat of any of these actions.
(d) Presumptions provided for in subdivisions (b) and (c) are presumptions affecting the burden of producing evidence as provided in Section 603 of the Evidence Code.
(e) If the civil penalty assessed is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less, the violation shall be issued and enforced in the same manner as a class “B” violation, except in no case shall the penalty be trebled. If the civil penalty assessed is in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), the violation shall be issued and enforced in the same manner as a class “A” violation, except in no case shall the penalty be trebled.
(f) A person who willfully violates this section is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine of not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).

(4)For purposes of this subdivision, “legal costs” means attorney’s fees, litigation costs, and expert witness fees incurred in the litigation.
(j)For purposes of this section, “long-term health care facility” means a facility defined under Section 1418, including, but not limited to, the facility’s administrative personnel, employees, boards, and committees of the board, and medical staff.
(k)For purposes of this section, “complainant” means a person who has filed a complaint, as defined in Section 1420.
(l)This section does not abrogate or limit any other theory of liability or remedy otherwise available at law.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law provides for the State Supplementary Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (SSP), which requires the State Department of Social Services to contract with the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments to SSP recipients to supplement Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments made available pursuant to the federal Social Security Act.
Under existing law, benefit payments under the SSP are calculated by establishing the maximum level of nonexempt income and federal SSI and state SSP benefits for each category of eligible recipient. The state SSP payment is the amount, when added to the nonexempt income and SSI benefits available to the recipient, which would be required to provide the maximum benefit payment.
This bill, for the 2015–16 fiscal year, and annually thereafter, would require the state maximum SSP grant for individuals to be readjusted and increased so that the state SSP payment and federal SSI payment, when combined, equal 112% of the federal poverty level. By increasing the amount of SSP payments, which are expended from a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law prohibits a licensee of a long-term health care facility from discriminating or retaliating in any manner against a complainant, or a patient or employee in its facility, based on the presentation of a grievance or complaint or activities related to a specified investigation or proceeding at the facility. Existing law makes the willful violation of these provisions punishable as a crime.
This bill would expand the antiretaliation protections to apply to all health care workers of a long-term health care facility. The bill would increase the civil penalties and criminal penalties that apply to licensees who violate the provisions. The bill would also specify that a complainant who has been discriminated against may recover attorney’s fees and other legal costs.
Because this bill would expand the scope of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1432 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to health facilities.

(b) (1) The exemption does not extend to property that is rented, vacant, under construction on the lien date, or that is a vacation or secondary home of the owner or owners, nor does it apply to property on which an owner receives the veteran’s exemption.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if a person receiving the exemption is not occupying the dwelling on the lien date because the dwelling was damaged in a misfortune or calamity, the person shall be deemed to occupy that same dwelling as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date, provided the person’s absence from the dwelling is temporary and the person intends to return to the dwelling when possible to do so. Except as provided in paragraph (3), when a dwelling has been totally destroyed, and thus no dwelling exists on the lien date, the exemption provided by this section shall not be applicable until the structure has been replaced and is occupied as a dwelling.
(3) A dwelling that was totally destroyed in a disaster for which the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency, that qualified for the exemption provided by this section prior to the commencement date of the disaster and that has not changed ownership since the commencement date of the disaster, shall be deemed occupied by the person receiving the exemption on the lien date provided the person intends to reconstruct a dwelling on the property and occupy the dwelling as his or her principal place of residence when it is possible to do so.
(c) For purposes of this section, all of the following apply:
(1) “Owner” includes a person purchasing the dwelling under a contract of sale or who holds shares or membership in a cooperative housing corporation, which holding is a requisite to the exclusive right of occupancy of a dwelling.

(i) A single-family dwelling occupied by an owner thereof as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date.
(ii) A multiple-dwelling unit occupied by an owner thereof on the lien date as his or her principal place of residence.
(iii) A condominium occupied by an owner thereof as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date.
(iv) Premises occupied by the owner of shares or a membership interest in a cooperative housing corporation, as defined in subdivision (i) of Section 61, as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date. Each exemption allowed pursuant to this subdivision shall be deducted from the total assessed valuation of the cooperative housing corporation. The exemption shall be taken into account in apportioning property taxes among owners of share or membership interests in the cooperative housing corporations so as to benefit those owners who qualify for the exemption.
(d) The exemption provided for in subdivision (k) of Section 3 of Article XIII of the California Constitution shall first be applied to the building, structure, or other shelter and the excess, if any, shall be applied to any land on which it may be located.

(2) An individual whose principal place of residence for more than 50 percent of the taxable year is with any other person who claimed that individual as a dependent for income tax purposes.
(3) An individual who has been granted or whose spouse has been granted the homeowners’ property tax exemption during the taxable year.

This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authority of a specified provision of the California Constitution, for a homeowners’ exemption in the amount of $7,000 of the full value of a “dwelling,” as defined, and authorizes the Legislature to increase this exemption.
This bill, beginning with the lien date for the 2016–17 fiscal year, would increase the homeowners’ exemption from $7,000 to $25,000 of the full value of a dwelling. This bill would also require, for the 2017–18 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the county assessor to adjust the amount of the homeowners’ exemption by the percentage change in the House Price Index for California for the first 3 quarters of the prior calendar year, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the Legislature, whenever it increases the homeowners’ property tax exemption, to provide a comparable increase in benefits to qualified renters. The Personal Income Tax Law authorizes various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including a credit for qualified renters in the amount of $120 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses if adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less, and in the amount of $60 for other individuals if adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to annually adjust for inflation these adjusted gross income amounts.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, increase this credit for a qualified renter to $428 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses if adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less, as adjusted for inflation, and to an amount equal to $214 for other individuals if adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less, as adjusted for inflation. The bill would also require, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the Franchise Tax Board to annually adjust for inflation, based upon the California Consumer Price Index, the amount of these credits. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the renters’ credit.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
The California Constitution requires the Legislature, in each fiscal year, to reimburse local governments for the revenue losses incurred by those governments in that fiscal year as a result of the homeowners’ property tax exemption.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","An act to amend Sections 218 and 17053.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy."

SECTION 1.
Article 23 (commencing with Section 18901) is added to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read:
Article  23. Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund
18901.
(a) An individual may designate on the tax return that a contribution in excess of the tax liability, if any, be made to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund established by Section 18901.1. That designation is to be used as a voluntary contribution on the tax return.
(b) The contributions shall be in full dollar amounts and may be made individually by each signatory on a joint return.
(c) A designation under subdivision (a) shall be made for a taxable year on the original return for that taxable year and once made is irrevocable. If payments and credits reported on the return, together with any other credits associated with the taxpayer’s account, do not exceed the taxpayer’s liability, the return shall be treated as though no designation has been made.
(d) When another voluntary contribution designation is removed from the tax return, or as soon as space is available, whichever occurs first, the Franchise Tax Board shall revise the form of the return to include a space labeled the “Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund” to allow for the designation permitted. The form shall also include in the instructions information that the contribution may be in the amount of one dollar ($1) or more and that the contribution shall be used to fund all of the following:
(1) Programs designed to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness.
(2) Prevention, investigation, and prosecution of animal cruelty and neglect.
(e) A deduction shall be allowed under Article 6 (commencing with Section 17201) of Chapter 3 of Part 10 for any contribution made pursuant to subdivision (a).
18901.1.
There is hereby established in the State Treasury the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund to receive contributions made pursuant to Section 18901. The Franchise Tax Board shall notify the Controller of both the amount of money paid by taxpayers in excess of their tax liability and the amount of refund money that taxpayers have designated pursuant to Section 18901 to be transferred to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund. The Controller shall transfer from the Personal Income Tax Fund to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund an amount not in excess of the sum of the amounts designated by individuals pursuant to Section 18901 for payment into that fund.
18901.2.
(a) All money transferred to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be allocated as follows:
(1) To the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of all costs incurred by the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller in connection with their duties under this article.
(2) To the Department of Food and Agriculture for allocation as follows:
(A) Up to 5 percent of the funds allocated to the department shall be used by the department for the development of a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness through activities that will promote the charitable tax deduction for the fund and seek continued contributions. These activities may include convening a philanthropic roundtable, developing literature for use by the city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter that is current on its reporting requirements to the State Department of Public Health, Veterinary Public Health Section, a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals affiliate, or a humane society affiliate for dissemination, and whatever other activities are deemed necessary and appropriate to promote the fund.
(B) Up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) shall be distributed to, and used by, a city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter that is current on its reporting requirements to the State Department of Public Health, Veterinary Public Health Section for the sole purpose of supporting spay and neuter activities by that entity to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness.
(C) The remaining moneys, if any, shall be used by programs designed to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness or programs for the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of animal cruelty and neglect. The grants are to be distributed to a city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter that is current on its reporting requirements to the State Department of Public Health, Veterinary Public Health Section, a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals affiliate, or a humane society affiliate. A society for the prevention of cruelty to animals affiliate or a humane society affiliate shall be a California corporation, duly incorporated in the state of California, in active status, as described on the business search page of the Secretary of State’s Internet Web site, and exempt from federal income taxation as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b) The Department of Food and Agriculture shall award grants through a competitive, project-specific grant process and shall be responsible for overseeing that grant program. A grantee shall not use a grant award for administrative expenses or for any purposes outside of California.
(c) The Department of Food and Agriculture may consult with the State Department of Public Health to develop the grant process and the oversight of the grant program.
(d) No Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund money shall be used to supplant state General Fund money for any purpose.
18901.3.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), this article shall remain in effect only until January 1 of the fifth taxable year following the first appearance of the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund on the tax return, or January 1, 2022, whichever occurs first, and is repealed as of December 1 of that year.
(b) (1) By September 1 of the second calendar year and by September 1 of each subsequent calendar year that the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund appears on the tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall do all of the following:
(A) Determine the minimum contribution amount required to be received during the next calendar year for the fund to appear on the tax return for the taxable year that includes that next calendar year.
(B) Provide written notification to the Department of Food and Agriculture of the amount determined in subparagraph (A).
(C) Determine whether the amount of contributions estimated to be received during the calendar year will equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount determined by the Franchise Tax Board for the calendar year pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Franchise Tax Board shall estimate the amount of contributions to be received by using the actual amounts received and an estimate of the contributions that will be received by the end of that calendar year.
(2) If the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of the contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount for the calendar year, this article shall be inoperative with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of that calendar year and shall be repealed on December 1 of that year.
(3) For purposes of this section, the minimum contribution amount for a calendar year means two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the second calendar year after the first appearance of the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund on the personal income tax return or the adjusted minimum contribution amount adjusted pursuant to subdivision (c).
(c) For each calendar year, beginning with the third calendar year after the first appearance of the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund on the tax return, the Franchise Tax Board shall adjust, on or before September 1 of that calendar year, the minimum estimated contribution amount specified in subdivision (b) as follows:
(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year, multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.","Existing law allows an individual taxpayer to contribute amounts in excess of his or her personal income tax liability for the support of specified funds.
This bill would allow an individual to designate on his or her tax return that a specified amount in excess of his or her tax liability be transferred to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund, which would be created by this bill. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to revise the tax return form to include a space for the designation of contributions to the fund when another voluntary designation is removed from the form or there is space, whichever occurs first.
This bill would require money contributed to the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of costs, as provided, and to the Department of Food and Agriculture for the development of a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness through activities that will promote the charitable tax deduction for the fund and seek continued contributions and the distribution of grants on a competitive basis to, among others, a city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter, as specified, for the purpose of supporting spay and neuter activities by that entity to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness.
The bill would provide that these provisions would remain in effect only until January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the first appearance of the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund on the tax return, or January 1, 2022, whichever occurs first, but would further provide for an earlier repeal if the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount, as defined, for that calendar year, in which case these provisions would be repealed on December 1 of that year.","An act to add and repeal Article 23 (commencing with Section 18901) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

Section 12926.05 is added to the Government Code, to read:
12926.05.
(a) An individual employed under a special license pursuant to Section 1191 or 1191.5 of the Labor Code in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility may bring an action under this part for any form of harassment or discrimination prohibited by this part.
(b) If an individual specified in subdivision (a) brings an action against an employer for any form of harassment or discrimination prohibited by this part, the employer has an affirmative defense to the action by proving, by a preponderance of evidence, both of the following:
(1) The challenged activity was permitted by statute or regulation.
(2) The challenged activity was necessary to serve employees with disabilities under a special license pursuant to Section 1191 or 1191.5 of the Labor Code.
(c) Nothing in this part relating to discrimination on account of disability shall subject an employer to legal liability for obtaining a license pursuant to Section 1191.5 of the Labor Code or paying an individual with a physical or mental disability less than minimum wage pursuant to either Section 1191 or Section 1191.5 of the Labor Code.
(d) The Legislature finds and declares that the definition of employee in subdivision (c) of Section 12926 was not intended to permit the harassment of, or discrimination against, an individual employed under a special license pursuant to Section 1191 or 1191.5 of the Labor Code in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility.","Existing law, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, protects the right to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination because of race, religious creed, physical disability, mental disability, sex, age, and sexual orientation, among other characteristics. The act prohibits various forms of employment discrimination, including discharging or refusing to hire or to select for training programs on a prohibited basis. The act prescribes requirements for filing complaints of employment discrimination with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and charges this department with investigating and determining whether or not to bring a civil action on behalf of the complainant, among other duties. The act exempts employers from remedies for specified unlawful employment practices, including when the discrimination is on the basis of physical or mental disability and the disability prevents the employee from safely performing essential duties even with reasonable accommodations. The act excludes from the definition of “employee,” any individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop or rehabilitation facility. A special license permits the employment of individuals with disabilities at a wage less than the legal minimum wage.
This bill would authorize an individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility to bring an action under the act for any form of harassment or discrimination prohibited by the act. The bill would provide an employer against whom the individual brings this action with an affirmative defense by proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that the challenged action was permitted by statute or regulation and was necessary to serve employees with disabilities under a special license. The bill would exempt an employer’s obtaining a special license, or hiring or employing a qualified individual at a wage less than the minimum wage in conformity with a special license, from the act’s provisions prohibiting discrimination based on disability. The bill would provide that the definition of employee was not intended to permit the harassment of, or discrimination against, an individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility.","An act to amend Section 12926 of, and to add Section 12926.05 to, the Government Code, relating to employment discrimination."

Individual local, state, and federal agencies have also adopted policies aimed at protecting wildlife corridors and habitat connectivity, in order to protect ecosystem health and biodiversity and to improve the resiliency of wildlife and their habitats to climate change. However, these efforts could be enhanced through establishment of a statewide policy to protect important wildlife corridors and habitat linkages where feasible and practicable.

Section 1930.5 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:
1930.5.
(a) Contingent upon funding being provided by the Wildlife Conservation Board from moneys available pursuant to Section 75055 of the Public Resources Code, or from other appropriate bond funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, the department shall investigate, study, and identify those areas in the state that are most essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages, as well as the impacts to those wildlife corridors from climate change, and shall prioritize vegetative data development in these areas.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Wildlife Conservation Board use various funds to work with the department to complete a statewide analysis of wildlife corridors and connectivity to support conservation planning and climate change adaptation activities.
(c) (1) It is the policy of the state to promote the voluntary protection of wildlife corridors and habitat strongholds in order to enhance the resiliency of wildlife and their habitats to climate change, protect biodiversity, and allow for the migration and movement of species by providing connectivity between habitat lands. In order to further these goals, it is the policy of the state to encourage, wherever feasible and practicable, voluntary steps to protect the functioning of wildlife corridors through various means, as applicable and to the extent feasible and practicable, those means may include, but are not limited to:
(A) Acquisition or protection of wildlife corridors as open space through conservation easements.

(d) The Legislature finds and declares that there are a number of existing efforts, including, but not limited to, efforts involving working landscapes, that are already working to achieve the policy described in subdivision (c).
(e) Subdivision (c) shall not be construed to create new regulatory requirements or modify the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (E) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 2820 of the Fish and Game Code, or the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
(f) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Habitat stronghold” means high-quality habitat that supports wildlife in being more resilient to increasing pressures on species due to climate change and land development.
(2) “Wildlife corridor” means a habitat linkage that joins two or more areas of wildlife habitat, allowing for fish passage or the movement of wildlife from one area to another.","Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to administer the Significant Natural Areas Program, and requires the department, among other things, to develop and maintain a spatial data system that identifies those areas in the state that are most essential for maintaining habitat connectivity, including wildlife corridors and habitat linkages. Existing law requires the department, contingent upon the provision of certain funding, to investigate, study, and identify those areas in the state that are most essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages and prioritize vegetative data development in those areas. Existing law requires the department to seek input from representatives of other state agencies, local government, federal agencies, nongovernmental conservation organizations, landowners, agriculture, recreation, scientific entities, and industry in determining essential wildlife corridors and habitat linkages.
This bill would declare that it is the policy of the state to encourage, wherever feasible and practicable, voluntary steps to protect the functioning of wildlife corridors through various means, as applicable.
Existing law provides for the establishment of conservation banks, defined as publicly or privately owned and operated sites that are to be conserved and managed for habitat protection purposes in accordance with an agreement with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law provides for the issuance of credits by a conservation bank to, among other things, reduce adverse impacts to fish or wildlife resources from certain activities. Existing law also provides for the establishment of mitigation banks, as defined.
This bill would include within the authorized purposes of a conservation bank the protection of habitat connectivity for fish and wildlife resources.
This bill would provide that the fact that a project applicant does not take voluntary steps to protect the functioning of a wildlife corridor prior to initiating the application process for the project shall not be grounds for denying a permit or requiring additional mitigation beyond what is otherwise required by law to mitigate project impacts.","An act to amend Sections 1797.5, 1930, and 1930.5 of the Fish and Game Code, relating to fish and wildlife."

527,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Between 2002 and 2006, the rates of maternal deaths and severe complications doubled in both California and the United States. For every maternal death, there are approximately 100 cases of severe complications as defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe complications occur in nearly 2 percent of all California births.
(b) Not only are these deaths and severe complications devastating for those affected families, but the cost to the state and private payers is significant. The University of California at Los Angeles studied the costs for maternal hemorrhage and preeclampsia/hypertension, the two leading causes of preventable maternal mortality and 80 percent of severe maternal morbidity. The study estimates that these conditions together cost Medi-Cal $200 million every year.
(c) Information and data regarding maternal mortality and morbidity provides a clearer understanding as to the causes and can be used for guidance in quality improvement projects needed to reduce or eliminate deaths and severe complications.
(d) Analysis using certificates of death alone has proven to be an incomplete and inadequate window into the underlying causes and assessment of maternal deaths and needs to be supplemented with other material, including coroner’s reports and medical records.
(e) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Maternal Child Health Bureau (HRSA-MCHB) all strongly encourage every state to form and support a multi-disciplinary committee to annually review maternal deaths in as timely a manner as possible. The CDC reports that 33 states have instituted maternal mortality committees.
(f) California’s over 500,000 annual births represent fully one-eighth of all United States births (and maternal deaths). Reviews of these cases represent an important resource for state and national efforts to better understand and reverse the rising rates of maternal mortality and morbidity.
(g) Data from prior California maternal mortality reviews have been particularly useful for launching statewide improvement projects to reduce maternal deaths led by the State Department of Public Health and the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. This act shall establish an ongoing multi-disciplinary panel for maternal mortality and severe morbidity reviews, including reports to the Legislature.
SEC. 2.
Section 123237 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
123237.
(a) For the purposes of this section, “maternal mortality” or “maternal death” means a death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of delivering or following the end of a pregnancy when the woman’s death is from medical causes, including suicide, and is related to or aggravated by the pregnancy. Cases meeting these criteria are currently estimated to total between 70 and 90 cases each year. Additional deaths occurring between 42 days and 1 year following delivery may be included in these reviews if resources and time permit. “Severe maternal morbidity” means major maternal complications, as defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, occurring during birth or within 42 days of delivery.
(b) A maternal mortality review panel is established to conduct ongoing comprehensive, multidisciplinary reviews of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity in California to identify factors associated with the deaths and make recommendations for system changes to improve health care services for women in this state. A maternity care provider shall chair the panel. Members of the panel shall be appointed by the director, must serve without compensation, and may include, as a minimum:
(1) An obstetrician.
(2) A physician specializing in maternal fetal medicine.
(3) A neonatologist.
(4) A certified nurse-midwife.
(5) A labor and delivery nurse.
(6) An anesthesiologist.
(7) A representative from the department who works in the field of maternal and child health.
(8) An epidemiologist with experience analyzing perinatal data.
(9) Other professionals determined by the department and the committee chair to address specific case review topics by the committee.
(c) The maternal mortality review panel shall conduct multidisciplinary reviews of maternal mortality and severe morbidity in California. The panel may not call witnesses or take testimony from any individual involved in the investigation of a maternal death or enforce any public health standard or criminal law, or otherwise participate, in any legal proceeding relating to a maternal death.
(d) (1) Information, documents, proceedings, records, and opinions created, collected, or maintained by the maternity mortality review panel or the department in support of the maternal mortality review panel are confidential and are not subject to public inspection or discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action.
(2) Any person who attends a meeting of the maternal mortality review panel or who participates in the creation, collection, or maintenance of the panel's information, documents, proceedings, records, or opinions shall not testify in any civil action as to the content of those proceedings, or the panel's information, documents, records, or opinions. This paragraph does not prevent a member of the panel from testifying in a civil action concerning facts that form the basis for the panel's proceedings of which the panel member has personal knowledge acquired independently of the panel or that is public information.
(3) Any person who, in substantial good faith, participates as a member of the maternal mortality review panel or provides information to further the purposes of the maternal mortality review panel may not be subject to an action for civil damages or other relief as a result of the activity or its consequences.
(4) All meetings, proceedings, and deliberations of the maternal mortality review panel may, at the discretion of the maternal mortality review panel, be confidential and may be conducted in executive session.
(5) The maternal mortality review panel and the director may retain identifiable information regarding facilities where maternal deaths occur, or from which the patient was transferred, and geographic information on each case solely for the purposes of trending and analysis over time. All individually identifiable information shall be removed before any case is reviewed by the panel.
(e) The department shall review department available data to identify maternal deaths. To aid in determining whether a maternal death was related to or aggravated by the pregnancy, and whether it was preventable, the department has the authority to do both of the following:
(1) Request and receive data for specific maternal deaths, including, but not limited to, all medical records, autopsy reports, medical examiner reports, coroner’s reports, and social service records.
(2) Request and receive data, as described in paragraph (1), from health care providers, health care facilities, clinics, laboratories, medical examiners, coroners, professionals, and facilities licensed by the department.
(f) Upon request by the department, health care providers, health care facilities, clinics, laboratories, medical examiners, coroners, professionals, and facilities licensed by the department must provide all medical records, autopsy reports, medical examiner reports, coroner’s reports, social services records, information, and other data requested for specific maternal deaths as provided in this subdivision to the department.
(g) The panel shall also review severe maternal morbidity data provided by either the department or the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC). This data shall be aggregated and deidentified but indicate major causes of morbidity and time trends.
(h) (1) Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the department, as part of its work to advance and improve California maternity care through data-driven quality improvement, shall prepare and submit to the Legislature a biennial report on maternal mortality in California based on the data collected. The report shall protect the confidentiality of all decedents and other participants involved in any incident. The report shall be distributed publically to stimulate performance improvement. Interim results may be shared with the CMQCC quality improvement programs. The report shall include both the following:
(A) A description of the maternal deaths reviewed by the panel during the preceding twenty-four months, including statistics and causes of maternal deaths presented in the aggregate. The report must not disclose any identifying information of patients, decedents, providers, and organizations involved.
(B) Evidence-based system changes and policy recommendations to improve maternal outcomes and reduce preventable maternal deaths in California.
(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(i) The department may use Title V Block Grant Program funds to support these efforts and may apply for additional federal government and private foundation grants, as needed. The department may also accept private, foundation, city, county, or federal monies to implement this section.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 123237 of the Health and Safety Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect confidential information, documents, proceedings, records, and opinions created, collected, or maintained by the maternity mortality review panel or the department in support of the maternity mortality review panel, it is necessary that this act limit the public’s right of access to that information.
SECTION 1.
Section 123237 is added to the
Health and Safety Code
, to read:
123237.
(a)Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the State Department of Public Health, as part of its work to advance and improve California maternity care through data-driven quality improvement, shall prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report on maternal mortality and morbidity in California. The report shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1)An analysis of maternal deaths that includes both of the following:
(A)Case review of each death.
(B)Analysis of patient demographics, contributing factors, and underlying causes.
(2)An analysis of all cases of severe maternal morbidity, as defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for which data collection is practicable, including analysis of patient demographics and underlying causes.
(3)Suggestions for improvements in care to reduce maternal death and severe maternal morbidity.
(b)In order to develop accurate reports in a resource-efficient manner, the department shall consider existing resources, including, but not limited to, all of the following:
(1)Existing data sources available to the department.
(2)Opportunities for partnerships with entities engaged in maternal care quality measurement or improvement.
(3)Use of physician volunteers or committees.
(c)A report submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, as specified. Existing law requires the department to maintain a program of maternal, child, and adolescent health.
This bill would require the department to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report on maternal mortality and morbidity in California, including an analysis of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity. The bill would also require the department, in order to develop accurate reports in a resource-efficient manner, to consider existing resources, including, among others, opportunities for partnerships with other entities and use of physician volunteers.
This bill would establish a maternal mortality review panel to conduct ongoing comprehensive, multidisciplinary reviews of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity in California to identify factors associated with the deaths and make recommendations for system changes to improve health care services for women in this state. The bill would also make information, documents, proceedings, records, and opinions created, collected, or maintained by the maternity mortality review panel or the State Department of Public Health in support of the maternal mortality review panel confidential and not subject to public inspection, discovery, or introduction into evidence in any civil action. The bill would also prohibit any person in attendance at a meeting of the maternal mortality review panel or who participates in the creation, collection, or maintenance of the panel’s information, documents, proceedings, records, or opinions to testify in any civil action as to the content of those proceedings or the panel’s information, documents, records, or opinions. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to review department available data to identify maternal deaths and would mandate health care providers, health care facilities, clinics, laboratories, medical examiners, coroners, professionals, and facilities licensed by the State Department of Public Health to provide documents, as specified, upon request of the department. The bill also requires the State Department of Public Health to prepare and submit to the Legislature a biennial report on maternal mortality in California based on the data collected.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Section 123237 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health."

Existing law limits the amount of this fee, cost, or charge to the actual cost incurred performing the inspections and enforcement activity, including permit fees, fines, late charges, and interest.
Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a local agency to make, by ordinance, any violation of an ordinance subject to an administrative fine or penalty and limits the maximum fine or penalty amounts for infractions, as specified.

CHAPTER  14.5. The CalFood Program
SEC. 4.
Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
18995.
(a) On and after January 1, 2016, the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP), administered by the State Department of Social Services, shall be renamed as the “CalFood Program.” The CalFood Program shall provide food and funding for the provision of emergency food to food banks established pursuant to the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program (7 C.F.R. Parts 250 and 251) whose ongoing primary function is to facilitate the distribution of food to low-income households.
(b) The CalFood Account is hereby established in the Emergency Food Assistance Program Fund established pursuant to Section 18852 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and may receive federal funds and voluntary donations or contributions.
(c) Notwithstanding Section 18853 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the following shall apply:
(1) All moneys received by the CalFood Account shall, upon appropriation by the Legislature, be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for allocation to the CalFood Program and, with the exception of those contributions made pursuant to Section 18851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and funds received through Parts 250 and 251 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations, shall be used for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California. Storage and transportation expenditures shall not exceed 10 percent of the CalFood Program fund’s annual budget.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), funds received by the CalFood Account shall, upon appropriation by the Legislature, be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for allocation to the CalFood Program as described in paragraph (1), and shall, in part, be used to pay for the department’s administrative costs associated with the administration of the CalFood Program.","(1) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws, including, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and before January 1, 2017, a credit for qualified taxpayers, defined as the person responsible for planting a crop, managing the crop, and harvesting the crop from the land, in an amount equal to 10% of the cost that would otherwise be included in, or required to be included in, inventory costs, as specified under federal law, with respect to the donation of fresh fruits or fresh vegetables to food banks located in California.
This bill, under both laws, would expand the credit to apply to the donation of qualified donation items, defined as raw agricultural products or processed foods. The bill would expand the definition of qualified taxpayer to also include the person responsible for growing or raising a qualified donation item, or harvesting, packing, or processing a qualified donation item. The bill would modify the credit amount to instead equal 15% of the qualified value, as defined, of the qualified donation items, but not less than an amount that would otherwise be calculated and allowed under existing law. The bill would extend the operation of the credit to taxable years before January 1, 2021, and would require it to be claimed on a timely filed original return. The bill would make various conforming changes and would also make a nonsubstantive change to the personal income tax provision.
(2) Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and administer the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP), to provide food and funding for the provision of emergency food to food banks, as provided. Existing law creates the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, would allocate the moneys in the account to SEFAP and require that those moneys be used for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California and for the department’s administrative costs.
This bill would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP) as the CalFood Program and would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account as the CalFood Account. The bill would make other conforming changes in this regard.","An act to amend Sections 17053.88 and 23688 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and to amend Section 18995 of, and to amend the heading of Chapter 14.5 (commencing with Section 18995) of Part 6 of Division 9 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to food banks."

(4) Provisions that allow corrosion prevention work to be performed by apprentices registered in an industrial apprenticeship program approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards pursuant to Section 3075 that provides training to meet the NACE 13/ACS 1 standard.
(5) Provisions that require an employer to maintain records of compliance with the standard and allow reasonable access to those records by members of the public in a manner that protects employee privacy.
(6) An appropriate phase-in period for the certification requirement that ensures full implementation of the standard by January 1, 2020.
(7) A definition of corrosion prevention work that includes surface preparation, including by abrasive blasting, and application of protective coatings and linings, including spray application, to steel and concrete surfaces for the purpose of corrosion prevention.
(8) An exception from the standard for work on sheet metal and ventilation systems or on plumbing and piping systems or precast concrete work that is performed offsite when the work on those systems or precast concrete work is performed by either of the following:

This bill would require the board, by June 1, 2017, to adopt a standard that requires an employer performing corrosion prevention work on industrial and infrastructure projects to use trained and certified personnel, as specified. Because certain violations of these new requirements would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law provides for apprenticeship programs within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards within the Department of Industrial Relations, sponsored by specific entities and employers, and requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards to perform various functions with respect to apprenticeship programs and the welfare of apprentices.
Existing law also establishes the California Apprenticeship Council within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, and requires the council to aid the director in formulating policies with respect to apprentice regulation.
Existing law requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards and the California Apprenticeship Council to report annually through the Director of Industrial Relations on the activities of the division and the council, and further requires that the report include specified information with respect to apprenticeship programs in this state.
This bill would require the report to include an analysis of any apprenticeship standards or regulations that were proposed or adopted in the previous year.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(1) Senior pupils who are engaged in volunteer work, whether through school or on their own, are likely to have significantly higher civics assessment scale scores than pupils who did not participate in volunteer work as reported by the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 1998.
(2) Community leaders report that service learning partnerships help build more positive community attitudes toward youth.
(3) Schools that support service learning and community service are more likely to have positive relationships with their community.

(b) The amendments to this chapter made by the act adding this subdivision shall apply only to franchise agreements entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, or to franchises of an indefinite duration that may be terminated by the franchisee or franchisor without cause.","The California Franchise Relations Act sets forth certain requirements related to the termination, nonrenewal, and transfer of franchises between a franchisor, subfranchisor, and franchisee, as those terms are defined.
That act, except as otherwise provided, prohibits a franchisor from terminating a franchise prior to the expiration of its term, except for good cause, which includes, but is not limited to, the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful requirement of the franchise agreement after being given notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the failure within 30 days.
This bill would instead limit good cause to the failure of the franchisee to substantially comply with the lawful requirements of the franchise agreement imposed on the franchisee after being given notice at least 60 days in advance and would require that the period for a reasonable opportunity to cure the failure be no less than 60 days from the date of the notice of noncompliance. The bill would prohibit the period for curing the failure from exceeding 75 days, except as specified. The bill also would allow immediate termination of a specified separate motor vehicle franchise under specified circumstances.
This bill would make it unlawful for a franchise agreement to prevent a franchisee from selling or transferring a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of the franchise business, as defined, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, to another person, provided that the person is qualified under the franchisor’s then-existing and reasonable standards for approval of new or renewing franchisees, as specified, and the parties comply with specified transfer provisions. The bill would prohibit a sale, transfer, or assignment of a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of a franchise business, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, without the franchisor’s written consent, but would prohibit that consent from being withheld unless the buyer, transferee, or assignor does not meet standards for new or renewing franchisees or the parties fail to meet specified transfer provisions.
This bill would require the franchisee, prior to the sale, assignment, or transfer of a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of a franchise business, as defined, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, to another person, to notify the franchisor of the franchisee’s intent to sell, transfer, or assign the franchise or its assets or interest, as specified, and would require the notice to be in writing and include specified information. The bill would require the franchisor, within a specified period, to notify the franchisee of the approval or disapproval of the proposed sale, assignment, or transfer of the franchise, and would require the notice to be in writing and be delivered by courier to the franchisee or sent by receipted mail. The bill would require the franchisor to communicate the franchisor’s standards for approval of new or renewing franchisees, as specified. The bill would deem a proposed sale, assignment, or transfer approved, unless disapproved by the franchisor, as specified.
The act requires a franchisor that terminates or fails to renew a franchise, other than in accordance with specified provisions of law, to offer to repurchase from the franchisee the franchisee’s resalable current inventory, as specified.
This bill would repeal those provisions and would, with certain exceptions, require the franchisor, upon a lawful termination or nonrenewal of a franchisee, to purchase from the franchisee at the value of price paid, minus depreciation, all inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings purchased or paid for under the franchise agreement, as specified. The bill would not require a franchisor to purchase assets to which the franchisee cannot or does not provide clear title and possession.
This bill would entitle a franchisee to receive from the franchisor the fair market value of the franchise business and assets, as well as resulting damages, if a franchisor terminates or fails to renew a franchise in violation of the act. The bill would provide for injunctive relief in the event of a violation or threatened violation of these provisions.
The bill would limit its application to a franchise agreement entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, or to franchises of an indefinite duration that may be terminated without cause.","An act to amend Sections 20020, 20021, 20036, and 20041 of, to amend the heading of Article 6 (commencing with Section 20035) of Chapter 5.5 of Division 8 of, to add Sections 20022, 20028, and 20029 to, and to repeal and add Section 20035 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to franchises."

48800.
(a) The governing board of a school district may determine which pupils would benefit from advanced scholastic or vocational work. The intent of this section is to provide educational enrichment opportunities for a limited number of eligible pupils, rather than to reduce current course requirements of elementary and secondary schools, and also to help ensure a smoother transition from high school to college for pupils by providing them with greater exposure to the collegiate atmosphere. The governing board of a school district may authorize those pupils, upon recommendation of the principal of the pupil’s school of attendance, and with parental consent, to attend a community college during any session or term as special part-time or full-time students and to undertake one or more courses of instruction offered at the community college level.
(b) If the governing board of a school district denies a request for a special part-time or full-time enrollment at a community college for any session or term for a pupil who is identified as highly gifted, the governing board shall issue its written recommendation and the reasons for the denial within 60 days. The written recommendation and denial shall be issued at the next regularly scheduled board meeting that falls at least 30 days after the request has been submitted.
(c) A pupil shall receive credit for community college courses that he or she completes at the level determined appropriate by the governing boards of the school district and community college district.

(A) Demonstrates adequate preparation in the discipline to be studied.
(B) Exhausts all opportunities to enroll in an equivalent course, if any, at his or her school of attendance.
(2) For any particular grade level, a principal shall not recommend for community college summer session attendance more than 5 percent of the total number of pupils who completed that grade immediately before the time of recommendation.
(3) A high school pupil recommended by his or her principal for enrollment in a course shall not be included in the 5-percent limitation of pupils allowed to be recommended pursuant to paragraph (2) if the course in which the pupil is enrolled is part of a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) program established pursuant to Section 76004 in which a majority of the pupils served are unduplicated pupils, as defined in Section 42238.02, the course meets one of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, and the high school principal who recommends the pupil for enrollment provides the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, upon the request of that office, with the data required for purposes of paragraph (4).
(A) The course is a lower division, college-level course for credit that is designated as part of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum or applies toward the general education breadth requirements of the California State University.
(B) The course is a college-level, occupational course for credit assigned a priority code of “A,” “B,” or “C,” pursuant to the Student Accountability Model, as defined by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and reported in the management information system, and the course is part of a sequence of vocational or career technical education courses leading to a degree or certificate in the subject area covered by the sequence.
(C) The course is necessary to assist a pupil who has not passed the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE), does not offer college credit in English language arts or mathematics, and the pupil meets both of the following requirements:
(i) The pupil is in his or her senior year of high school.
(ii) The pupil has completed all other graduation requirements before the end of his or her senior year, or will complete all remaining graduation requirements during a community college summer session, which he or she is recommended to enroll in, following his or her senior year of high school.
(4) On or before March 1 of each year, the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall report to the Department of Finance the number of pupils recommended pursuant to paragraph (3) who enroll in community college summer session courses and who receive a passing grade. The information in this report may be submitted with the report required by subdivision (c) of Section 76002.
(5) The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges shall not include enrollment growth attributable to paragraph (3) as part of its annual budget request for the California Community Colleges.
(6) Notwithstanding Article 3 (commencing with Section 33050) of Chapter 1 of Part 20 of Division 2, compliance with this subdivision shall not be waived.
(e) Paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of subdivision (d) shall become inoperative on January 1, 2020.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to ensure rigorous scholastic and vocational work opportunities are available to pupils at the earliest possible time and that ongoing programs are not interrupted, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to authorize a pupil who meets specified criteria to attend community college. Existing law limits the number of pupils a principal is authorized to recommend for community college summer session pursuant to those provisions to 5% of the total number of pupils in any grade level, as specified.
This bill, until January 1, 2020, would exempt from the 5% limitation pupils who meet specified requirements and who enroll in certain community college courses. The bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to annually report to the Department of Finance the number of pupils who enrolled and received a passing grade in a community college summer session course.

The bill would require the department, before issuing or renewing a driver’s license, to access the Prohibited Armed Persons File to determine if the person applying for, or renewing, the driver’s license is listed as a prohibited person.","An act to amend Section 30000 of the Penal Code, and to amend Sections 4750 and 12805 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."
539,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The Los Angeles River has a complex ecological and political history. The river originally ran freely along an alluvial flood plain, which today is the City of Los Angeles. In the 1930s, destructive flooding led the United States Army Corps of Engineers to design and build facilities to minimize the impacts of future floods, a process that included lining most of the river with concrete. Since then, the city, county, and federal government have all played a role in restoring the Los Angeles River, including the county’s 1996 adoption of a master plan for developing and restoring the entire Los Angeles River. The City of Los Angeles developed a “revitalization plan” to restore the Upper Los Angeles River, which lies within the city’s boundaries. Most recently, the Corps of Engineers approved “Alternative 20,” a substantial restoration and infrastructure project along the Upper Los Angeles River.
(b) The City of Los Angeles was given responsibility for managing the river’s resources through a charter by the King of Spain at the end of the 18th century. After serious floods in the 1930s, the federal government, through the United States Army Corps of Engineers, stepped in to take responsibility for building and managing infrastructure projects to reduce the risk and damage from flooding, with the county as the local partner. The county also works with the city in managing the Upper Los Angeles River, where court decisions have held that the King of Spain’s charter gives the city “pueblo” water rights with authority to manage the Upper Los Angeles River’s resources. The courts have not given the city authority over the Lower Los Angeles River.
(c) The State of California retains its sovereign authority to manage the rivers within its boundaries, including the Los Angeles River. Historically, however, it has not exercised that authority, due to the dominance of the United States Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the county. The county’s master plan addresses the entire river but is close to two decades old, and would benefit from renewed attention to resources and development, especially on the lower river. The Lower Los Angeles River passes through many cities, but not one of these cities has the responsibility and the resources to invest in restoration of that part of the Los Angeles River. There is therefore opportunity and need for the state to aid in the development and implementation of the county’s Master Plan, especially for the Lower Los Angeles River.
(d) In 2014, California voters approved the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, which included $60 million for the Los Angeles River, authorizing funding for both the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which has responsibility for the Upper Los Angeles River, and the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, which has responsibility for the Lower Los Angeles River. The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 allocated $30 million to each conservancy for the purpose of multibenefit water quality, water supply, and watershed protection and restoration projects for the watersheds.
SEC. 2.
Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 32622) is added to Division 22.8 of the Public Resources Code, to read:
CHAPTER  6. Lower Los Angeles River Working Group
32622.
(a) The Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency shall appoint, in consultation with the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to the extent that the board wishes to consult, a local working group to develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los Angeles River watershed, called the Lower Los Angeles River Working Group. The secretary shall consider requests from local agency representatives to participate in the working group. The working group may include, but need not be limited to, representatives from the conservancy, the County of Los Angeles, the Gateway Cities Council of Governments, the Los Angeles Gateway Region Integrated Regional Water Management Joint Powers Authority, elected officials of the cities riparian to the Los Angeles River, and nonprofit organizations serving the Los Angeles River region.
(b) On or before March 1, 2017, the working group shall develop, through watershed-based planning methods, a revitalization plan that addresses the unique and diverse needs of the Lower Los Angeles River and the communities through which it passes. The plan shall be consistent with and enhance, and may be incorporated into, the County of Los Angeles’s Master Plan for the entire Los Angeles River. The plan shall include watershed education programs that help the Los Angeles River communities recognize the value of the river and the importance of protecting the river’s watershed resources and its vitality to their communities.
(c) The conservancy shall provide any necessary staffing to the working group to assist in the development of the plan.
(d) The development and implementation of the revitalization plan may be eligible for funding from any public or private source, including, but not limited to, funding pursuant to Section 79735 of the Water Code. Entities that are eligible to implement the revitalization plan include, but are not limited to, state agencies, local agencies, and nonprofit organizations, and may be eligible for state funding.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the Lower Los Angeles River’s complex ecological and political history and the unique obstacles the local governments of the Lower Los Angeles River encounter when managing the river and its surrounding areas.","Existing law provides for the protection, enhancement, and restoration of rivers in this state. Existing law establishes the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy for the purpose of, among others, providing for the public’s enjoyment and enhancement of recreational and education experiences on public lands in the San Gabriel Watershed and Lower Los Angeles River.
This bill would require the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to appoint, in consultation with the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to the extent the board wishes to consult, a local working group to develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los Angeles River watershed, called the Lower Los Angeles River Working Group. The bill would require the secretary to consider requests from local agency representatives to participate in the working group and would authorize the working group to include specified representatives. The bill would require, by March 1, 2017, the working group to develop, through watershed-based planning methods, a revitalization plan that addresses the unique and diverse needs of the Lower Los Angeles River, that is consistent with, enhances, and is authorized to be incorporated into the County of Los Angeles’s Master Plan, and that includes watershed education programs. The bill would require the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy to provide any necessary staffing to assist the working group.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Lower Los Angeles River.","An act to add Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 32622) to Division 22.8 of the Public Resources Code, relating to the Los Angeles River."

The bill would require the board of directors of the district to provide for the preparation of regular audits of the district’s accounts and records and specified annual financial reports. By imposing duties on the district and the Counties of Lassen and Modoc in connection with the operation of the district, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Big Valley Water District.","An act to create the Big Valley Watermaster District, and prescribing its boundaries, organization, operation, management, financing, and other powers and duties, relating to water districts."

(B) Submit the report to the Secretary of State.
(C) Post the report on the Internet Web site of the elections official.
(k) For purposes of this section, “eligible entity” means both of the following:

SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the voting behavior, demographic characteristics, and unique special election experiences of San Diego County. It is the intent of the Legislature that the provisions of this act continue the pilot program that may be used for future special elections.","Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2020, San Diego County to conduct, as a pilot program, an all-mailed ballot special election or special consolidated election to fill a congressional or legislative vacancy under specified conditions. If such an election is conducted, existing law requires San Diego County to report certain information to the Legislature and the Secretary of State regarding the success of the election.
This bill, until January 1, 2021, would authorize San Diego County, or any city, school district, community college district, special district, or other district or political subdivision whose boundaries are located wholly within San Diego County, to conduct an all-mailed ballot special election or special consolidated election to fill a vacancy on the legislative or governing body of those entities. The bill would authorize those entities to also hold an all-mailed ballot special election for county initiatives, city initiatives, district initiatives, bond issues, and school measures conducted pursuant to specified provisions. The bill would extend the pilot program for San Diego County, as described above, until January 1, 2021. The bill would also require certain voter education workshops to be conducted in-person.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of San Diego.","An act to amend Section 4000.5 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

SEC. 3.
Chapter 2.8 (commencing with Section 1954.600) is added to Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:
CHAPTER  2.8 Bed Bug Infestations
1954.600.
The Legislature finds and declares:
(a) Controlling bed bugs is uniquely challenging, as bed bug resistance to existing insecticidal control measures is significant. Cooperation among landlords, tenants, and pest control operators is required for successful control. With cooperation among landlords, tenants, and pest control operators, most bed bug infestations can be successfully controlled.
(b) Effective control is more likely to occur when landlords and tenants are informed of the best practices for bed bug control.
(c) Early detection and reporting of bed bugs is an important component required for preventing bed bug infestations. Tenants should not face retaliation for reporting a problem.
(d) Lack of cooperation by landlords and tenants can undermine pest control operator efforts to identify the presence of bed bugs and control an infestation. Depending on the treatment strategy, it is often critical that tenants cooperate with pest control operators by reducing clutter, washing clothes, or performing other activities. Likewise, inadequate or untimely response or planning by landlords may exacerbate an infestation.
(e) Pest control operators with knowledge and education in current best practices for bed bug management, such as those created by the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), are best equipped to help property owners and tenants eradicate bed bugs from their home.
(f) The Structural Pest Control Board should incorporate training in bed bug management based on the National Pest Management Association (NPMA) best practices for the issuance or renewal of a Branch 2 operator, field representative, or applicator license.
1954.601.
For purposes of this chapter, the term “pest control operator” means an individual holding a Branch 2 operator, field representative, or applicator license from the Structural Pest Control Board.
1954.602
(a) A landlord shall not show, rent, or lease to a prospective tenant any vacant dwelling unit that the landlord knows has a current bed bug infestation.
(b) This section does not impose a duty on a landlord to inspect a dwelling unit or the common areas of the premises for bed bugs if the landlord has no notice of a suspected or actual bed bug infestation. If a bed bug infestation is evident on visual inspection, the landlord shall be considered to have notice pursuant to this section.
1954.603.
On and after July 1, 2017, prior to creating a new tenancy for a dwelling unit, a landlord shall provide a written notice to the prospective tenant as provided in this section. This notice shall be provided to all other tenants by January 1, 2018. The notice shall be in at least 10-point type and shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
(a) General information about bed bug identification, behavior and biology, the importance of cooperation for prevention and treatment, and the importance of and for prompt written reporting of suspected infestations to the landlord. The information shall be in substantially the following form:


Information about Bed Bugs
Bed bug Appearance: Bed bugs have six legs. Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about
1/4
of an inch in length. Their color can vary from red and brown to copper colored. Young bed bugs are very small. Their bodies are about
1/16
of an inch in length. They have almost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it appear to be a different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals. Bed bugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden.
Life Cycle and Reproduction: An average bed bug lives for about 10 months. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bed bugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days.
Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding.
Bed bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten. A person’s reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts caused by the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all.
Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:
• Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.
• Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.
• Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.
• Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping. However, some people do not show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed bugs may have fed on them.
For more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National Pest Management Association.


(b) The procedure to report suspected infestations to the landlord.
1954.604.
Entry to inspect a tenant’s dwelling unit shall comply with Section 1954. Entry to inspect any unit selected by the pest control operator and to conduct followup inspections of surrounding units until bed bugs are eliminated is a necessary service for the purpose of Section 1954. Tenants shall cooperate with the inspection to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs, including providing requested information that is necessary to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs to the pest control operator.
1954.605.
The landlord shall notify the tenants of those units inspected by the pest control operator pursuant to Section 1954.604 of the pest control operator’s findings. The notification shall be in writing and made within two business days of receipt of the pest control operator’s findings. For confirmed infestations in common areas, all tenants shall be provided notice of the pest control operator’s findings.
SEC. 4.
Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 1942.5 of the Civil Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 2881. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 1942.5 of the Civil Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 2881, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.","Existing law imposes various obligations on landlords who rent out residential dwelling units, including the general requirement that the building be in a fit condition for human occupation. Among other responsibilities, existing law requires a landlord of a residential dwelling unit to provide each new tenant who occupies the unit with a copy of the notice provided by a registered structural pest control company, as specified, if a contract for periodic pest control service has been executed.
This bill would prescribe the duties of landlords and tenants with regard to the treatment and control of bed bugs. The bill would require a landlord to provide a prospective tenant, on and after July 1, 2017, and to all other tenants by January 1, 2018, information about bed bugs, as specified. The bill would require that the landlord provide notice to the tenants of those units inspected by the pest control operator of the pest control operator’s findings within 2 business days, as specified. The bill would prohibit a landlord from showing, renting, or leasing a vacant dwelling unit that the landlord knows has a bed bug infestation, as specified.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1942.5 of the Civil Code, proposed by AB 2881, that would become operative only if this bill and AB 2881 are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","An act to amend Section 1942.5 of, to amend and renumber Section 1954.1 of, and to add Chapter 2.8 (commencing with Section 1954.600) to Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of, the Civil Code, relating to tenancy."

(h) Upon administrative dissolution or administrative surrender in accordance with this section, the nonprofit corporation’s or the foreign corporation’s liabilities for qualified taxes, interest, and penalties as defined in Section 23156 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, if any, shall be abated. Any actions taken by the Franchise Tax Board to collect that abated liability shall be released, withdrawn, or otherwise terminated by the Franchise Tax Board, and no subsequent administrative or civil action shall be taken or brought to collect all or part of that amount. Any amounts erroneously received by the Franchise Tax Board in contravention of this section may be credited and refunded in accordance with Article 1 (commencing with Section 19301) of Chapter 6 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

(b) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Qualified nonprofit corporation” means a nonprofit corporation identified in Section 5059, 5060, or 5061 of the Corporations Code or a foreign nonprofit corporation, as defined in Section 5053 of the Corporations Code that has qualified to transact intrastate business in this state and that satisfies any of the following conditions:
(A) Was operating and previously obtained tax-exempt status with the Franchise Tax Board, but had its tax-exempt status revoked under subdivision (c) of Section 23777.
(B) Was operating and previously obtained tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service, but had its tax-exempt status revoked under Section 6033(j) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(C) Was never doing business, within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 23101, in this state at any time after the time of its incorporation in this state.

(e) The Franchise Tax Board shall prescribe any rules and regulations that may be necessary or appropriate to implement this section. Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code shall not apply to any standard, criterion, procedure, determination, rule, notice, or guideline established or issued by the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to this section.
SEC. 7.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Nonprofit Corporation Law, among other things, generally regulates the organization and operation of nonprofit public benefit corporations, nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, and nonprofit religious corporations.
(1) Existing law authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic taxpayer to be suspended, and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this state to be forfeited, if certain tax liabilities are not paid or a taxpayer fails to file a tax return. Existing law also authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic corporation exempt from income tax to be suspended and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign corporation in this state exempt from income tax to be forfeited if the organization fails to file the annual information return or a specified statement for organizations not required to file the information return or pay a specified amount due. Existing law requires notice prior to the suspension or forfeiture of a taxpayer’s corporate powers, rights, and privileges. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to transmit to the Secretary of State the names of those taxpayers subject to these suspension or forfeiture provisions and thereby makes the suspension or forfeiture effective. Under existing law, the Secretary of State’s certificate is prima facie evidence of the suspension or forfeiture.
This bill would make a nonprofit public benefit corporation, a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, a nonprofit religious corporation, and a foreign nonprofit corporation, subject to administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, as specified, if the nonprofit corporation’s or foreign corporation’s corporate powers are, and have been, suspended or forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board for a specified period of time. Prior to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender of the nonprofit corporation or foreign corporation, the bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to provide notice to the corporation of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to transmit to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General’s Registry of Charitable Trusts the names and Secretary of State file numbers of the corporations subject to administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. The bill would also require the Secretary of State to provide notice of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender on its Internet Web site, as specified. The bill would authorize a nonprofit corporation or foreign corporation to provide the Franchise Tax Board with a written objection to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. If there is no written objection or the written objection fails, the bill would require the corporation to be administratively dissolved or administratively surrendered and would provide that the certificate of the Secretary of State is prima facie evidence of the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. Upon administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, the bill would abate the nonprofit corporation’s liabilities for qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as provided.
(2) Existing law, the Nonprofit Corporation Law, authorizes a nonprofit public benefit corporation, nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, and nonprofit religious corporation to elect voluntarily to wind up and dissolve by either approval of a majority of all members or approval of the board and approval of the members. Under existing law, the General Corporation Law, when a corporation has not issued shares, a majority of the directors, or, if no directors have been named in the articles or have been elected, the incorporator or a majority of the incorporators, are authorized to sign and verify a specified certificate of dissolution. Existing law requires the certificate to be filed with the Secretary of State and requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board of the dissolution. Existing law provides that, upon the filing of the certificate, a corporation is dissolved and its powers, rights, and privileges cease.
This bill would enact provisions similar to those General Corporation Law provisions and make them applicable to nonprofit public benefit corporations, nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, and nonprofit religious corporations. The bill would additionally provide that liability to creditors, if any, is not discharged, the liability of the directors of the dissolved nonprofit corporation is not discharged, and the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not diminish or adversely affect the ability of the Attorney General to enforce specified liabilities.
(3) Existing law requires every corporation doing business within the limits of this state and not expressly exempted from taxation to annually pay to the state, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises within this state, a tax according to or measured by its net income, as specified. Under existing law, every corporation, except as specified, is subject to the minimum franchise tax until the effective date of dissolution or withdrawal or, if later, the date the corporation ceases to do business within the limits of this state. Upon certification by the Secretary of State that a nonprofit public benefit corporation or a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation has failed to file the required Statement of Information, existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specified penalty.
This bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to abate, upon written request by a qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined, unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as defined, for the taxable years in which the nonprofit corporation certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it was not doing business, as defined. The bill would make this abatement conditioned on the dissolution of the qualified corporation within a specified period of time of filing the request for abatement. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out these abatement provisions and would exempt these rules and regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.
(4) Existing state constitutional law prohibits the Legislature from making any gift, or authorizing the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal, or other corporation.
This bill would make certain legislative findings and declarations that abatement of a nonprofit corporation’s liabilities for specified taxes, penalties, and interest serves a public purpose, as provided.
(5) By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Sections 5008.9, 6610.5, 8610.5, and 9680.5 to the Corporations Code, and to add Section 23156 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to nonprofit corporations."

(2) The state council shall work collaboratively with the department and the Association of Regional Center Agencies to develop standardized forms and protocols that shall be used by all regional centers and the state council in collecting and reporting this information. In addition to identifying services and supports that are needed, but currently unavailable, the forms and protocols shall also solicit input and suggestions on alternative and innovative service delivery models that would address consumer needs.
(3) In addition to the information provided pursuant to paragraph (2), the state council may utilize information from other sources, including, but not limited to, public hearings, quality assurance assessments conducted pursuant to Section 4571, regional center reports on alternative service delivery submitted to the department pursuant to Section 4669.2, and the annual report on self-directed services produced pursuant to Section 4685.7.
(4) The department shall provide additional information, as requested by the state council.
(5) Based on the information provided by the regional centers and other agencies, the state council shall develop an assessment of the need for new, expanded, or converted community services and support, and make that assessment available to the public. The assessment shall include a discussion of the type and amount of services and supports necessary but currently unavailable including the impact on consumers with common characteristics, including, but not limited to, disability, specified geographic regions, age, and ethnicity, face distinct challenges. The assessment shall highlight alternative and innovative service delivery models identified through their assessment process.
(6) This needs assessment shall be conducted at least once every five years and updated annually. The assessment shall be included in the state plan and shall be provided to the department and to the appropriate committees of the Legislature. The assessment and annual updates shall be made available to the public. The State Council on Developmental Disabilities, in consultation with the department, shall make a recommendation to the Department of Finance as to the level of funding for program development to be included in the Governor’s Budget, based upon this needs assessment.
(c) In addition to parental fees and General Fund appropriations, the Program Development Fund may be augmented by federal funds available to the state for program development purposes, when these funds are allotted to the Program Development Fund in the state plan. The Program Development Fund is available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the department, and subject to any allocations that may be made in the annual Budget Act. In no event shall any of these funds revert to the General Fund.
(d) The department may allocate funds from the Program Development Fund for any legal purpose, provided that requests for proposals and allocations are approved by the state council in consultation with the department, and are consistent with the priorities for program development in the state plan. Allocations from the Program Development Fund shall take into consideration the following factors:
(1) The future fiscal impact of the allocations on other state supported services and supports for persons with developmental disabilities.
(2) (A) The information on priority services and supports needed, but currently unavailable, submitted by the regional centers.
(B) Consistent with the level of need as determined in the state plan, excess parental fees may be used for purposes other than programs specified in subdivision (a) only when specifically appropriated to the State Department of Developmental Services for those purposes.
(e) Under no circumstances shall the deposit of federal moneys into the Program Development Fund be construed as requiring the State Department of Developmental Services to comply with a definition of “developmental disabilities” and “services for persons with developmental disabilities” other than as specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 4512 for the purposes of determining eligibility for developmental services or for allocating parental fees and state general funds deposited in the Program Development Fund.

4784.
(a) The Director of Developmental Services shall establish, annually review, and adjust as needed, a schedule of parental fees for services received through the regional centers. Effective July 1, 2009, this schedule shall be revised to reflect changes in economic conditions that affect parents’ ability to pay the fee, but not to exceed an inflationary factor as determined by the department.
(b) The parental fee schedule established pursuant to this section shall be exempt from Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(c) In establishing the amount parents shall pay, the director shall take into account all of the following factors:
(1) The current cost of caring for a child at home, as determined by the most recent data available from the United States Department of Agriculture’s survey on the cost of raising a child in California, adjusted for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the survey date to the date of payment adjustment.
(2) Medical expenses incurred prior to regional center care.
(3) Whether the child is living at home.
(4) Parental payments for medical expenses, clothing, incidentals, and other items considered necessary for the normal rearing of a child.
(5) Transportation expenses incurred in visiting a child.
(d) The parental fee schedule shall exempt families with an income below the federal poverty level from assessment and payment of the parental fee.
(e) (1) The adjusted fee shall be assessed in full for children when the out-of-home placement commences on or after July 1, 2009.
(2) For children placed out-of-home prior to July 1, 2009, the department shall determine the increase in the parental fee above the amount assessed using the fee schedule in effect on June 30, 2009. This fee increase shall be implemented over three years, with one-third of the increase added to the fee on July 1, 2009, one-third of the increase added to the fee on July 1, 2010, and the final third added to the fee on July 1, 2011.

SEC. 4.
Section 4784 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
4784.
(a) The department shall assess a monthly fee to parents of children under 18 years of age who are receiving 24-hour out-of-home care services through a regional center or as a resident of a state hospital when the family’s gross income is above 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
(b) The monthly parental fees and credits established pursuant to this section shall be exempt from Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(c) A monthly parental fee described in this section shall be assessed beginning 60 days from the date of the child’s placement in 24-hour out-of-home care.
(d) For the purpose of assessing the fee, parents shall provide income documentation to the department within 30 days of the date the department requested the documentation. Income documentation shall include a copy of a parent’s most recent federal tax return or a copy of each parent’s most recent paystub or employer-provided earnings statement, issued within 60 days of the date the department requested the documentation. A self-employed parent shall document his or her income by providing a copy of his or her most recent federal tax return. A parent without income documentation shall report and certify his or her income on a form provided by the department.
(e) (1) The monthly parental fee for parents who timely submit income documentation or from whom the department does not request income documentation shall be as follows:
(A) Parents who have a family income of 201 percent to 300 percent, inclusive, of the current federal poverty level shall be assessed a monthly fee of 3 percent of their annual gross income, divided by 12.

(C) Parents who have a family income of 401 percent to 500 percent, inclusive, of the current federal poverty level shall be assessed a monthly fee of 5 percent of their annual gross income, divided by 12.
(D) Parents who have a family income of 501 percent or more of the current federal poverty level shall be assessed a monthly fee of 6 percent of their annual gross income, divided by 12.
(2) The monthly parental fee for parents who fail to provide income documentation to the department within 30 days of the date the department requested the documentation shall be equivalent to the maximum monthly cost of caring for a child, as determined by the most recent data available from the United States Department of Agriculture’s survey on the cost of raising a child in the west region. However, if parents whose monthly parental fee is calculated pursuant to this paragraph later provide the required income documentation, their monthly parental fee shall be recalculated pursuant to paragraph (1) and retroactively adjusted based on the income information provided.
(3) A monthly parental fee assessed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the maximum monthly cost of caring for a child, as determined by the most recent data available from the United States Department of Agriculture’s survey on the cost of raising a child in the west region, or the cost of the services provided, whichever is less.
(4) A monthly parental fee assessed pursuant to this section shall be recalculated every 12 months, on the date of the original fee assessment, and within 60 days of the date a parent notifies the department of a change in family income or family size and provides updated income documentation, as described in subdivision (d).
(5) Parents of children placed in 24-hour out-of-home care prior to July 1, 2016, shall have their initial monthly parental fee calculated, pursuant to the provisions of this section, at the time of their annual fee recalculation, or within 60 days of a parental request for review by the department and receipt of the family’s completed family financial statement.
(6) The department may grant a temporary waiver from paying the monthly parental fee for parents who substantiate, with receipts, an unavoidable and uninsured catastrophic loss with direct economic impact on the family or significant unreimbursed medical costs associated with care for a child who is a regional center consumer.
(f) Parents who remove their child from 24-hour out-of-home care for a home visit for six or more consecutive hours during a 24-hour period shall be entitled to a credit equal to one day of the monthly parental fee. A credit shall be calculated by multiplying the parents’ monthly parental fee by 12 and dividing that number by the number of days in the year. In order to receive a credit pursuant to this subdivision, parents shall submit a request to the department that is postmarked no later than 60 days after the day for which the credit was earned. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in a denial of the credit by the department.
(g) All fees collected shall be remitted to the State Treasury to be deposited into the Program Development Fund established in Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 4670) to provide resources needed to initiate new programs, consistent with approved priorities for the program development in the state plan, or to be used by the department to offset General Fund costs.
(h) Parents may appeal a determination of the amount of a monthly parental fee or the denial or amount of a credit requested pursuant to subdivision (f) by submitting a written appeal request to the director within 30 days of the date of the monthly parental fee confirmation letter or credit confirmation or denial letter. An appeal pursuant to this subdivision may consider only disputes concerning the family income used to set the monthly parental fee and the denial or amount of credit. The director, or his or her designee shall, within 30 days after receipt of the appeal, review the assessed monthly parental fee or credit denial or amount for accuracy and provide written notice of the decision to the appellant. The director or his or her designee shall, when deciding an appeal of a monthly parental fee, consider the income documentation and the calculation of the monthly parental fee described in subdivision (e). All decisions regarding monthly parental fee appeals shall be retroactive to the date the appealed monthly parental fee was assessed.
(i) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2016.","Under existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, the State Department of Developmental Services is required to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law requires the Director of Developmental Services to establish, annually review, and adjust as needed, a schedule of parental fees to be paid by parents of children under 18 years of age who are receiving 24-hour out-of-home care services through a regional center or who are residents of a state hospital or on leave from the state hospital.
Existing law provides that all parental fees collected by or for regional centers are remitted to the State Treasury to be deposited in the Program Development Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.
This bill would, effective July 1, 2016, revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, calculating monthly parental fees based on a percentage of the parents’ annual income and authorizing a credit of the equivalent of one day of the monthly parental fee for each day a child spends 6 or more consecutive hours in a 24-hour period on a home visit. The bill would prohibit a monthly parental fee from exceeding the maximum monthly cost of caring for a child or the cost of services provided, whichever is less. The bill would require, for parents of children placed in 24-hour out-of-home care prior to July 1, 2016, the monthly parental fee to be calculated at the time of the parents’ annual fee recalculation, or within 60 days of a parental request for review by the department and receipt of the family’s completed family financial statement. The bill would provide that the Program Development Fund is available upon appropriation by the Legislature and make other related and conforming changes.","An act to amend Section 4677, to amend, repeal, and add Section 4784 of, and to repeal Section 4782 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to developmental services."

(2) For purposes of this subdivision, total disability shall not be less favorable to the insured than the following:
(A) During the first 24 months of total disability, the insured is unable to perform with reasonable continuity the substantial and material duties of his or her job due to sickness or bodily injury.
(B) After the first 24 months of total disability, the insured, due to sickness or bodily injury, is unable to engage with reasonable continuity in any other job in which he or she could reasonably be expected to perform satisfactorily in light of his or her age, education, training, experience, station in life, or physical and mental capacity.

(b) “Special surrender benefit” is defined as a “waiver of surrender charge benefit” wherein the insurer waives the surrender charge usually charged for a withdrawal of funds from the cash value of a life insurance contract or the account value of an annuity contract if the owner, insured, or annuitant, as applicable, meets any of the following criteria:
(1) Develops any medical condition where the owner’s, insured’s, or annuitant’s life expectancy is expected to be less than or equal to a limited period of time that shall not be restricted to a period of less than 12 months or greater than 24 months.

(A) Either of the following:
(i) Impairment in performing two out of seven activities of daily living, as set forth in subdivisions (a) and (g) of Section 10232.8, meaning the insured needs human assistance, or needs continual substantial supervision.

Existing law provides that insurance under a group life insurance policy may be extended to insure the dependents of each insured employee under the group policy, as specified. Existing law defines a dependent for these purposes as including the employee’s spouse and all children from birth until 26 years of age, or a child 26 years of age or older who is both incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of intellectual disability or physical handicap and chiefly dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance, as specified.
This bill would clarify that for dependent children over the age of majority the group policyholder would be authorized to elect coverage at age variations up to the limiting age.
Existing law defines a waiver of premium benefit or a waiver of monthly deduction benefit under a life insurance contract as a supplemental benefit that operates to safeguard a life insurance contract against lapse when the insured becomes totally disabled, as defined by the supplemental benefit, and continues until the end of the insured’s disability or the period specified by the supplemental benefit, consistent with specified restrictions. Existing law requires, if the insured’s total disability begins before the insured attains 60 years of age, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled. Existing law requires, if the insured’s total disability begins when the insured is 60 years of age or older, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled up to 65 years of age.
This bill would require an insurer, for an insured who becomes totally disabled before attaining 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit, to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period of total disability up to the time the insured attains 65 years of age. The bill would also permit an insurer to collect premiums or monthly deductions from an insured who becomes totally disabled on or after 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit. The bill would require an insurer offering a renewal for a group life insurance policy issued prior to January 1, 2017, that contains a supplemental benefit to offer the employer a continuation of the in-force supplemental benefit, and would authorize the insurer to concurrently offer the group policyholder the option to change the supplemental benefit to either waive or collect premiums or monthly deductions as described above.","An act to amend Sections 10203.4 and 10271.1 of the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."

Notwithstanding any provision of law, for a period not to exceed two years from the date of the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., a state agency that provides certification, registration, or licensure necessary to promote the safety and protection of the public may, on a case-by-case basis, consider for certification, registration, or licensure students who were enrolled in a program of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., that provided education or training aimed towards these students receiving certification, registration, or licensure from the state agency, and who did not receive that certification, registration, or licensure due to the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc. This consideration shall be provided at the discretion of the state agency in accordance with its public protection mandate and applicable criteria established by the agency for consumer safety.

Section 94925 of the Education Code is amended to read:
94925.
(a) The amount in the Student Tuition Recovery Fund shall not exceed thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) at any time.
(b) If the bureau has temporarily stopped collecting the Student Tuition Recovery Fund assessments because the fund has approached the thirty million dollar (30,000,000) limit in subdivision (a), the bureau shall resume collecting Student Tuition Recovery Fund assessments when the fund falls below twenty million dollars ($20,000,000).

SEC. 8.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to provide immediate educational and economic relief to the thousands of students harmed by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.","(1) The California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 provides for the regulation of private postsecondary educational institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education in the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act also establishes the Student Tuition Recovery Fund and requires the bureau to adopt regulations governing the administration and maintenance of the fund, including requirements relating to assessments on students and student claims against the fund, and establishes that the moneys in this fund are continuously appropriated to the bureau for specified purposes. The act caps the amount that may be in the fund at any time at $25,000,000.
This bill would raise the cap for the fund to $30,000,000.
(2) This bill would appropriate the sum of $1,300,000 from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for the purposes of providing grants to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist eligible students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., as defined, with loan discharge and other student loan-related requests and tuition recovery-related claims, and to pay an amount not to exceed $150,000 for the reasonable administrative costs of the Attorney General’s office related to these grants, as specified, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the bureau to notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges, Inc., closures within 15 days of the effective date of these provisions. The bill would require the Attorney General to, among other things, within 90 days of the notification, solicit grant applications from eligible nonprofit community service organizations, select one or more of these organizations deemed to be qualified, and set additional terms and conditions of the grants as necessary. The bill would set a schedule for how grant funds are to be distributed. The bill would require the grantee to submit specified information to the Attorney General on a quarterly basis, and require the Attorney General to make these reports available to the Legislature and the bureau upon request. The bill would require the Attorney General to provide the Legislature and the bureau a final report summarizing all the information submitted to it by grantees, promptly following the time when all funds are expended by the grantees, or by August, 1, 2018, whichever is earlier. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to contract with another qualified entity to perform the Attorney General’s duties under these provisions.
(3) This bill would, for a period not to exceed 2 years from April 27, 2015, authorize state agencies that provide certification, registration, or licensure necessary to promote the safety and protection of the public to, on a case-by-case basis, consider for certification, registration, or licensure students who were enrolled in a program of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., that provided education or training aimed towards these students receiving certification, registration, or licensure from the state agency, and who did not receive that certification, registration, or licensure due to the closure of that institution.
(4) The Cal Grant Program prohibits an applicant from receiving Cal Grant awards totaling in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of four years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on Cal Grant awards a student who was enrolled and received a Cal Grant award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(5) The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program authorizes the renewal of California National Guard Education Assistance Awards, for a maximum of the greater of either four years of full-time equivalent enrollment or the duration for which the qualifying member would otherwise be eligible pursuant to the Cal Grant Program, if specified conditions are met.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on California National Guard Education Assistance Awards a student who was enrolled and received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(6) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Section 94925 of, and to add Sections 69433.61, 69999.19, 94051, and 94926.5 to, the Education Code, relating to higher education, making an appropriation therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

(2) Mathematics. The state board may not adopt basic instructional materials in this subject area or the subject area specified by paragraph (1) in the year succeeding the year in which the state board adopts basic instructional materials in this subject area for the same grade level.
(3) Science.
(4) Social science.
(5) Bilingual or bicultural subjects.
(6) Any other subject, discipline, or interdisciplinary areas for which the state board determines the adoption of instructional materials to be necessary or desirable.

(1) Instructional materials may be submitted for adoption in any of the subject areas pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive, of subdivision (a) at least once but not more than twice every eight years. The state board shall ensure that curriculum frameworks are reviewed and adopted in each subject area and that the criteria for evaluating instructional materials developed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 60204 are consistent with subdivision (c). The state board may prescribe reasonable conditions to restrict the resubmission of materials that have been previously rejected if those resubmitted materials have no substantive changes.
(2) If a publisher or manufacturer submits revisions to currently adopted instructional material for review after the timeframe specified by the state board, the department shall assess a fee on the submitting publisher or manufacturer in an amount that shall not exceed the reasonable costs to the department to conduct a review of the instructional material pursuant to this section.
(3) Submitted instructional materials shall be adopted or rejected within six months of the submission date of the materials pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the state board determines that a longer period of time, not to exceed an additional three months, is necessary due to the estimated volume or complexity of the materials for that subject in that year, or due to other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the state board.
(4) The process for review of instructional materials shall involve review committees, which shall include, but not be limited to, volunteer content experts and instructional material reviewers, and shall be composed of a majority of classroom teachers from a wide variety of affected grade levels and subject areas.
(5) The rules and procedures for adoption of instructional materials shall be transparent and consistently applicable regardless of the format of the instructional materials, which may include, but not be limited to, print, digital, and open-source instructional materials.
(c) In reviewing and adopting or recommending for adoption submitted basic instructional materials, the state board shall use the following criteria, and ensure that, in its judgment, the submitted basic instructional materials meet all of the following criteria:
(1) Are consistent with the criteria and the standards of quality prescribed in the state board’s adopted curriculum framework. In making this determination, the state board shall consider both the framework and the submitted instructional materials as a whole.

(3) Are factually accurate and incorporate principles of instruction reflective of current and confirmed research.
(4) Are aligned to the content standards adopted by the state board in the subject area and the grade level or levels for which they are submitted.
(5) Do not contain materials, including illustrations, that provide unnecessary exposure to a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo. Materials, including illustrations, that contain a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo may not be used unless the state board determines that the use of the commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo is appropriate based on one of the following specific findings:
(A) If text, the use of the commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo in the instructional materials is necessary for an educational purpose, as defined in the guidelines or frameworks adopted by the state board.
(B) If an illustration, the appearance of a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo in an illustration in instructional materials is incidental to the general nature of the illustration.
(6) Meet other criteria as are established by the state board as being necessary to accomplish the intent of Section 7.5 of Article IX of the California Constitution and of Section 1 of Chapter 1181 of the Statutes of 1989, provided that the criteria are approved by resolution at the time the resolution adopting the framework for the current adoption is approved, or at least 12 months before the date that the materials are to be approved for adoption.
(d) If basic instructional materials are rejected, the state board shall provide a specific, written explanation of the reasons why the submitted materials were not adopted, based on one or more of the criteria established under subdivision (c). In providing this explanation, the state board may use, in whole or in part, materials written by the Superintendent or any other advisers to the state board.
(e) The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if either of the following occurs:
(1) Fewer than five basic instructional materials are submitted.
(2) The state board specifically finds that fewer than five basic instructional materials meet the criteria prescribed by paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (c), or the materials fail to meet the state board’s adopted curriculum framework. If the state board adopts fewer than five basic instructional materials in any subject for any grade level, the state board shall conduct a review of the degree to which the criteria and procedures used to evaluate the submitted materials for that adoption were consistent with the state board’s adopted curriculum framework.
(f) This section does not limit the authority of the state board to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials.
(g) Consistent with the quality criteria for the state board’s adopted curriculum framework, the state board shall prescribe procedures to provide the most open and flexible materials submission system and ensure that the adopted materials in each subject, taken as a whole, provide for the educational needs of the diverse pupil populations in the public schools, provide collections of instructional materials that illustrate diverse points of view, represent cultural pluralism, and provide a broad spectrum of knowledge, information, and technology-based materials to meet the goals of the program and the needs of pupils.
(h) Upon making an adoption, the state board shall make available to listed publishers and manufacturers and all school interests a listing of instructional materials, including the most current unit cost of those materials as computed pursuant to existing law. Items placed upon lists shall remain thereon, and be available for procurement through the state’s systems of financing, from the date of the adoption of the item and until a date established by the state board. The date established by the state board for continuing items on that list shall be the date on which the state board adopts instructional materials based on a new or revised curriculum framework. Lists of adopted instructional materials shall be made available by subject and grade level to school districts and posted on the department’s Internet Web site, and shall include information from the reports of findings from the review committees pursuant to paragraph publisher of instructional materials from including whatever corporate name or logo on the instructional materials that is necessary to provide basic information about the publisher, to protect its copyright, or to identify third-party sources of content.
(n) The state board may adopt regulations that provide for other exceptions to this section, as determined by the state board.
(o) The Superintendent shall develop, and the state board shall adopt, guidelines to implement this section.
SEC. 2.
Section 60227 is added to the Education Code, to read:
60227.
(a) For purposes of this section, a followup adoption is any adoption other than the primary adoption that occurs within the eight-year cycle established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 60200.
(b) Before conducting a followup adoption in a given subject area, the department shall post an appropriate notice on the department’s Internet Web site pursuant to subdivision (c) and notify all publishers or manufacturers known to produce basic instructional materials in that subject area.
(c) The notice shall specify that each publisher or manufacturer choosing to participate in the followup adoption shall be assessed a fee based on the number of programs the publisher or manufacturer indicates will be submitted for review and the number of grade levels proposed to be covered by each program.
(d) The fee shall offset the cost of conducting the followup adoption process and shall reflect the department’s best estimate of the cost. The department shall take reasonable steps to limit costs of the followup adoption and to keep the fee modest, recognizing that some of the work necessary for the primary adoption need not be duplicated.
(e) The department, before incurring substantial costs for the followup adoption, shall require that a publisher or manufacturer who wishes to participate in the followup adoption first declare the intent to submit one or more specific programs for the followup adoption and specify the specific grade levels to be covered by each program. After a publisher or manufacturer has declared the intent to submit one or more programs and the grade levels to be covered by each program, the department shall assess a fee. The fee shall be payable by the publisher or manufacturer even if the publisher or manufacturer subsequently chooses to withdraw a program or reduce the number of grade levels covered. A submission by a publisher or manufacturer shall not be reviewed for purposes of adoption, either in a followup adoption or in any other primary or followup adoption conducted thereafter, until the fee assessed has been paid in full.
(f) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that the fee not be so substantial that it prevents small publishers or manufacturers from participating in a followup adoption.
(2) Upon the request of a small publisher or manufacturer, the state board may reduce the fee for participation in the followup adoption.
(3) For purposes of this section, “small publisher” and “small manufacturer” mean an independently owned or operated publisher or manufacturer who is not dominant in its field of operation, and who, together with its affiliates, has 100 or fewer employees, and has average annual gross receipts of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) or less over the previous three years.
(g) Revenue derived from fees charged pursuant to subdivision (e) shall be budgeted as reimbursements and subject to review through the annual budget process and may be used to pay costs associated with any adoption and any costs associated with the review of instructional materials.
(h) If the department determines that there is little or no interest by publishers and manufacturers in participating in a followup adoption, the department shall recommend to the state board that the followup adoption not be conducted and the state board may choose not to conduct the followup adoption.
(i) General fund revenue shall not be used for the cost of conducting a followup adoption pursuant to this section.
(j) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2024, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2024, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive, and to adopt procedures for the submission of instructional materials, and provides that instructional materials may be submitted for adoption in specified subject areas every 8 years.
This bill would instead provide that instructional materials may be submitted for adoption at least once but no more than twice every 8 years. The bill, until January 1, 2024, would require the State Department of Education, before conducting a followup adoption, as defined, in a given subject area to post a notice on the department’s Internet Web site and notify all publishers or manufacturers known to produce basic instructional materials in that subject area that each publisher and manufacturer choosing to participate in the followup adoption shall be assessed a fee, as specified.","An act to amend Section 60200 of, and to add and repeal Section 60227 of, the Education Code, relating to instructional materials."

SECTION 1.
Section 143.1 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
143.1.
(a) The board shall conduct hearings on such requests for a permanent variance after employees or employee representatives of the applicant are properly notified. The applicant shall also give notice to workers at the place of employment who will be affected by the permanent variance, or representatives of affected employees who may be affected by, or exposed to, hazards by the permanent variance from an occupational safety and health standard. The applicant shall provide certification that the affected employees have been given notice of the request for a permanent variance.
(b) Upon request to the board, affected employees or their representatives shall be granted party status to the variance proceeding.
(c) All board decisions on a permanent variance shall be final except for a rehearing or judicial review provided for by law.
SEC. 2.
Section 6450 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
6450.
(a) Any employer may apply to the division for a temporary order granting a variance from an occupational safety or health standard. A temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application that meets the requirements of Section 6451, and establishes the following:
(1) The employer is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date.
(2) The employer is taking all available steps to safeguard employees against the hazards covered by the standard.
(3) The employer has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable.
(b) Any temporary order issued under this section shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes the employer is required to adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail a program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and other affected workers as described in Section 6450.5 and an opportunity for a hearing. However, the division may issue one interim order for a temporary variance upon submission of an application showing that the employment or place of employment will be safe for employees and other affected workers pending a hearing on the application for a temporary variance. A temporary order shall not be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than twice provided that the requirements of this section are met and an application for renewal is filed before the expiration date of the order. A single renewal of an order shall not remain in effect for longer than 180 days.
SEC. 3.
Section 6450.5 is added to the Labor Code, to read:
6450.5.
The employer shall also give notice to workers at the place of employment who will be affected by the temporary variance, or representatives of affected workers, who may be affected by or exposed to the hazard covered by the standard, by the temporary variance from an occupational safety and health standard. Upon request to the division, or to the standards board upon appeal pursuant to Section 6455, any affected worker, or representative of affected workers, shall be granted party status to the variance proceedings.
SEC. 4.
Section 6451 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
6451.
An application for a temporary order under Section 6450 shall contain all of the following:
(a) A specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance.
(b) A representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons having firsthand knowledge of the facts represented, that the employer is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor.
(c) A statement of the steps the employer has taken and will take, with specific dates, to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard.
(d) A statement of when the employer expects to be able to comply with the standard and what steps the employer has taken and will take, with dates specified, to come into compliance with the standard.
(e) A certification that the employer has informed employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted, and by other appropriate means. A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the division for a hearing.
(f) A certification that the employer has given notice as required in Section 6450.5.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law establishes the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board in the Department of Industrial Relations to adopt, amend, or repeal employment safety standards and laws. Existing law authorizes the board, upon the application of an employer, to grant a permanent variance from an occupational standard or order after specified notice and hearing requirements are met. The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 also authorizes an employer to apply to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, that enforces employment safety laws, for a temporary order granting a variance from an occupational safety or health standard and requires the order to be granted only if the employer’s application satisfies specified requirements. Existing law provides that a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing. Existing law specifies the information that an application for a temporary order is required to contain.
This bill would require an employer to also give notice to workers at the place of employment who will be affected by a permanent or temporary variance, or representatives of affected workers, who may be affected by or exposed to the hazards by the permanent or temporary variance from an occupational safety and health standard. The bill would require any affected worker, or representative of affected workers, upon request, to be granted party status to the variance proceedings. The bill would require the variance application to include a certification that the employer has given notice to affected workers as required. Because a violation of the new requirements for employers would be a crime under certain circumstances, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 143.1, 6450, and 6451 of, and to add Section 6450.5 to, the Labor Code, relating to employment."

(2) Shall not transfer, in whole or in part, from one facility to another, a supplemental service, as defined in regulations of the director pursuant to this chapter, without first obtaining a certificate of need, unless the licensee, 30 days prior to the relocation, notifies the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the applicable health systems agency, and the state department of the licensee’s intent to relocate the supplemental service, and includes with this notice a cost estimate, certified by a person qualified by experience or training to render the estimates, which estimates that the cost of the transfer will not exceed the capital expenditure threshold established by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development pursuant to Section 127170.
(3) Shall not transfer beds from one facility to another facility, without first obtaining a certificate of need unless, 30 days prior to the relocation, the licensee notifies the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the applicable health systems agency, and the state department of the licensee’s intent to relocate health facility beds, and includes with this notice both of the following:

a hospital licensed to provide emergency medical services, the location in which those services are provided.
(c) “Encounter” means a face-to-face contact between a patient and the provider who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the condition of the patient at a given contact and exercises independent judgment in the care of the patient.
(d) “Freestanding ambulatory surgery clinic” means a surgical clinic that is licensed by the state under paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1204.

Under existing law, the physical plants maintained and operated under a general acute care hospital’s single consolidated license must be located no more than 15 miles apart, unless a specified exception applies.
This bill would create an exception to permit a general acute care hospital to operate an emergency department located more than 15 miles from its main physical plant, if all applicable requirements of licensure are satisfied.
The bill would also permit a closing general acute care hospital’s emergency department to continue to be operated at the same location or locations by an acquiring general acute care hospital, as specified. The bill would create an exception to permit the acquiring general acute care hospital to operate the closing general acute care hospital’s emergency department at that location or locations, even if located more than 15 miles from the acquiring general acute care hospital’s main physical plant, if all applicable requirements of licensure are satisfied.","An act to amend

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Research points to a strong connection between mental wellness and academic achievement.
(2) Research demonstrates that early detection and treatment of mental illness improves attendance, behavior, and academic achievement.
(3) It is estimated that 20 percent of children have mental health issues, 80 percent of whom are estimated to be undiagnosed and untreated. The lack of attention to a child’s mental health has significant effects on his or her school achievement and life outcomes.
(4) Mental health challenges disproportionately impact pupils who face stressors such as violence, trauma, and poverty.
(5) California’s educators report their lack of preparedness in addressing pupil mental health challenges as a major barrier to instruction. Most educators and staff lack training to identify pupils who may be in need of support and to make referrals, as appropriate, to help pupils overcome and manage mental health issues and succeed in school.
(6) The State Department of Education has identified inadequate service referral and inconsistent pupil mental health policies as major factors contributing to pupils’ lack of access to support for mental health concerns.
(7) Several initiatives are underway to improve the early identification and referral of pupils for help with mental health challenges. These include the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association’s K-12 Student Mental Health Initiative, funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority; the federally funded Project Cal-Well administered by the State Department of Education; Training Educators through Recognition and Identification Strategies (TETRIS); the Eliminating Barriers to Learning (EBL) project administered by the State Department of Education and funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority; and the Student Mental Health Policy Workgroup established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California Mental Health Services Authority.
(8) In spite of these efforts, no model referral protocol exists to guide schools and local educational agencies in appropriate and timely intervention for pupil mental health concerns.
(9) The State Department of Education, through its Project Cal-Well and its Student Mental Health Policy Workgroup, is well positioned to provide state leadership and guidance to local educational agencies so that they are better able to address pupil mental health concerns.
(b) It is therefore the intent of the Legislature to direct the development of model, evidence-based referral protocols for addressing pupil mental health concerns that may be voluntarily used by schoolsites, school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and teacher and administrator preparation programs.
SEC. 2.
Section 33319.6 is added to the Education Code, to read:
33319.6.
(a) The department shall develop model referral protocols for addressing pupil mental health concerns. In developing these protocols, the department shall consult with the members of the Student Mental Health Policy Workgroup, local educational agencies that have served as state or regional leaders in state or federal pupil mental health initiatives, county mental health programs, current classroom teachers and administrators, current schoolsite classified staff, current schoolsite staff who hold pupil personnel services credentials, current school nurses, current school counselors, and other professionals involved in pupil mental health as the department deems appropriate.
(b) These protocols shall be designed for use, on a voluntary basis, by schoolsites, school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and the state special schools for the blind and the deaf, and by teacher, administrator, school counselor, pupil personnel services, and school nurse preparation programs operated by institutions of higher education. The protocols shall do all of the following:
(1) Address the appropriate and timely referral by school staff of pupils with mental health concerns.
(2) Reflect a multitiered system of support processes and positive behavioral interventions and supports.
(3) Be adaptable to varied local service arrangements for mental health services.
(4) Reflect evidence-based and culturally appropriate approaches to pupil mental health referral.
(5) Address the inclusion of parents and guardians in the referral process.
(6) Be written to ensure clarity and ease of use by certificated and classified school employees.
(7) Reflect differentiated referral processes for pupils with disabilities and other populations for whom the referral process may be distinct.
(8) Be written to ensure that school employees act only within the authorization or scope of their credential or license. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing or encouraging school employees to diagnose or treat mental illness unless they are specifically licensed and employed to do so.
(9) Be consistent with state activities conducted by the department in the administration of federally funded mental health programs.
(c) The department shall post the model referral protocols on its Internet Web site so that they may be accessed and used by educational institutions specified in subdivision (b).
(d) This section is contingent upon funds being appropriated for its purpose to the department in the annual Budget Act or other legislation, or state, federal, or private funds being allocated for this purpose.
(e) The model referral protocols shall be completed and made available within two years of the date funds are received or allocated to implement this section.","Existing law provides that school districts and county offices of education are responsible for the overall development of a comprehensive school safety plan for each of their constituent schools, and encourages school safety plans to include clear guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of certain parties with school-related health and safety responsibilities, as specified.
This bill would require the State Department of Education to develop model referral protocols, as provided, for addressing pupil mental health concerns. The bill would require the department to consult with various entities in developing the protocols, including current classroom teachers and administrators. The bill would require the department to post the model referral protocols on its Internet Web site. The bill would make these provisions contingent upon funds being appropriated for its purpose in the annual Budget Act or other legislation, or state, federal, or private funds being allocated for this purpose.

CHAPTER  5. Joint Pension Administration and Sustainability Committee
SEC. 2.
Section 10600 of the Government Code is amended to read:
10600.
(a) The Legislature finds that the retirement of officers and employees of the state, school districts, and many cities, counties, and public jurisdictions in the state, is provided under several independently administered and highly complex systems that all share the distinctive feature of being organized to achieve results over the 30- to 40-year time frame that corresponds to the typical length of workers’ careers.
(b) These pension systems are organized and administered under highly technical statutes and protected by constitutional provisions. Certain provisions in the California Constitution, which are patterned upon the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, commonly known as ERISA, require that pension funds be invested for the sole interests of the beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and establish a standard of conduct that makes persons managing the pension systems fiduciaries with respect to how they manage the money.
(c) Development and change in these systems are interrelated and have important long-range implications both with respect to cost and to the retirement expectations of public employees and also the state and national economy, as the ability of persons to enter into retirement with a source of income to spend on goods and services in retirement provides an important source of demand for goods and services during economic downturns to assist eventual recovery as well as assisting the ability of public entities to transition their workforces to younger entry level employees as older workers are able to retire even during an economic downturn, thereby creating openings.
(d) The Legislature recognizes the need to coordinate this change and development and for continuing study and analysis of these systems and legislation affecting them.
(e) Therefore, it is the desire of the Legislature to provide for such continuing study and analysis by a joint legislative committee.

(b) (1) At the meeting, the State Treasurer shall present a review of the investment practices of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System and shall transmit a copy of the report to the committee.
(2) A report submitted pursuant to paragraph
(2)

The Legislature finds and declares that this bill furthers the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 81012 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing, including requiring the reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures and imposing other reporting and recordkeeping requirements on campaign committees. The act requires elected officers, candidates, and committees to file various reports, including semiannual reports, preelection statements, and supplemental preelection statements.
This bill would recast the requirements for filing preelection statements and would repeal other reporting requirements, including supplemental preelection statements and supplemental independent expenditure reports.
The act defines “committee” to include a person or combination of persons who receives contributions or makes independent expenditures of $1,000 or more in a calendar year. The act defines “late contributions” and “late independent expenditures” for purposes of the act to include certain contributions and independent expenditures, respectively, that are made within 90 days before the date of the election.
This bill would revise the definition of “committee” by increasing the qualifying monetary threshold to $2,000 for contributions received by a person or combination of persons.
This bill would revise the definitions of “late contributions” and “late independent expenditures” to specify that those terms also include contributions and independent expenditures that are made on the date of the election.
The bill would also make conforming changes.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","An act to amend Sections 82013, 82036, 82036.5, 84101, 84103, 84200.6, 84206, 84207, 84218, and 85201 of, to repeal Sections 84200.7, 84202.5, and 84203.5 of, and to repeal and add Section 84200.5 of, the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."

shall apply
applies
to all asbestos tort actions filed on or after January 1, 2017, and all asbestos tort actions pending on January 1, 2017, if the initial trial date in the asbestos tort action has not yet passed.","Existing law provides generally for procedures governing civil actions. Existing law imposes additional procedures that apply with respect to limited types of civil actions.
This bill would enact the Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act, which would establish additional procedures with respect to civil actions pertaining to asbestos tort claims, as defined. The bill would, among other things, require that a plaintiff produce, at the same time he or she serves answers to interrogatories, all asbestos trust claim documents, as specified, and would provide that these documents are not subject to a claim of privilege. The bill would also require the plaintiff, in answering interrogatories, to disclose the facts related to his or her alleged exposure to asbestos. The bill would authorize a defendant to file a motion to compel the plaintiff’s compliance with the production and disclosure requirements, as described above. The bill would require the court to retain jurisdiction over an asbestos tort action for 4 years after entry of judgment for certain purposes.
Existing law requires a court to grant a petition of a party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age for a preference if the court makes certain findings. Existing law authorizes a court to grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting this preference.
This bill provide that a plaintiff is entitled to a trial preference if he or she has complied with specific disclosure requirements and would require a plaintiff in an asbestos tort action who files a motion for preference to submit a sworn affidavit that he or she has complied with those disclosure requirements.","An act to
amend Section 36 of, and to
add Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 820) to Title 10 of Part 2 of, the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to civil claims."

SECTION 1.
Section 4007.5 of the Family Code is repealed.

Section 4007.5 is added to the Family Code, to read:
4007.5.
(a) Every money judgment or order for support of a child shall be suspended, by operation of law, for any period exceeding 90 consecutive days in which the person ordered to pay support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, unless either of the following conditions exist:
(1) The person owing support has the means to pay support while incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized.
(2) The person owing support was incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized for an offense constituting domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211, against the supported party or supported child, or for an offense that could be enjoined by a protective order pursuant to Section 6320, or as a result of his or her failure to comply with a court order to pay child support.
(b) The child support obligation shall resume on the first day of the first full month after the release of the person owing support in the amount previously ordered, and that amount is presumed to be appropriate under federal and state law. This section does not preclude a person owing support from seeking a modification of the child support order pursuant to Section 3651, based on a change in circumstances or other appropriate reason.
(c) (1) A local child support agency enforcing a child support order under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.) may, upon written notice of the proposed adjustment to the support obligor and obligee along with a blank form provided for the support obligor or obligee to object to the administrative adjustment to the local child support agency, administratively adjust account balances for a money judgment or order for support of a child suspended pursuant to subdivision (a) if all of the following occurs:
(A) The agency verifies that arrears and interest were accrued in violation of this section.
(B) The agency verifies that neither of the conditions set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) exist.
(C) Neither the support obligor nor obligee objects, within 30 days of receipt of the notice of proposed adjustment, whether in writing or by telephone, to the administrative adjustment by the local child support agency.
(2) If either the support obligor or obligee objects to the administrative adjustment set forth in this subdivision, the agency shall not adjust the order, but shall file a motion with the court to seek to adjust the arrears and shall serve copies of the motion on the parties, who may file an objection to the agency’s motion with the court. The obligor’s arrears shall not be adjusted unless the court approves the adjustment.
(3) The agency may perform this adjustment without regard to whether it was enforcing the child support order at the time the parent owing support qualified for relief under this section.
(d) This section does not prohibit the local child support agency or a party from petitioning a court for a determination of child support or arrears amounts.
(e) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized” includes, but is not limited to, involuntary confinement to the state prison, a county jail, a juvenile facility operated by the Division of Juvenile Facilities in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or a mental health facility.
(2) “Suspend” means that the payment due on the current child support order, an arrears payment on a preexisting arrears balance, or interest on arrears created during a qualifying period of incarceration pursuant to this section is, by operation of law, set to zero dollars ($0) for the period in which the person owing support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized.
(f) This section applies to every money judgment or child support order issued or modified on or after the enactment of this section.
(g) The Department of Child Support Services shall, by January 1, 2016, and in consultation with the Judicial Council, develop forms to implement this section.
(h) On or before January 1, 2019, the Department of Child Support Services and the Judicial Council shall conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of the administrative adjustment process authorized by this section and shall report the results of the review, as well as any recommended changes, to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The evaluation shall include a review of the ease of the process to both the obligor and obligee, as well as an analysis of the number of cases administratively adjusted, the number of cases adjusted in court, and the number of cases not adjusted.
(i) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to limit the duration of the interruption in the protections provided by former Section 4007.5 of the Family Code, it is necessary that this bill take effect immediately.","Prior law required, until July 1, 2015, the obligation of a person to pay child support pursuant to an order that is being enforced by a local child support agency under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act to be suspended for the period of time exceeding 90 days in which the person required to pay support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, with specified exceptions. Prior law required that, upon the release of the obligor, the obligation to pay child support immediately resume in the amount otherwise specified in the child support order prior to the suspension of that obligation. Prior law required the court to provide notice to the parties of the support obligation suspension at the time the order was issued or modified. Prior law authorized an obligor, upon release from incarceration or involuntary institutionalization, to petition the court for an adjustment of the arrears pursuant to the suspension of the support obligation.
This bill would enact similar provisions to require the suspension of a child support order to occur by operation of law when an obligor is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, unless the obligor has the means to pay support, or the obligor was incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized for either an offense constituting domestic violence or the failure to pay child support. The bill would also authorize the local child support agency to administratively adjust account balances for a money judgment or order for support of a child that is suspended by operation of law if the agency verifies that arrears and interest were accrued in violation of these provisions, that specified conditions relating to the obligor’s inability to pay while incarcerated and the underlying offense for which he or she was incarcerated do not exist, and neither the obligor nor the obligee object to the adjustment. The bill would require the local child support agency to give notice, as prescribed, of the adjustment to the obligor and obligee. If either the obligor or the obligee objects to the adjustment, the bill would require the agency to file a motion with the court to adjust the arrears and would allow the adjustment only after approval by the court. The bill would require the child support obligation to resume on the first day of the first full month after the release of the person owing support. The bill would require the Department of Child Support Services, in consultation with the Judicial Council, to develop forms to implement these provisions, and would require them to report specified information relating to these provisions to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee on or before January 1, 2019. The bill would make these provisions operative only until January 1, 2020.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to repeal and add Section 4007.5 of the Family Code, relating to child support, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

(d) The history of controlled substances dispensed to an individual based on data contained in CURES that is received by an authorized subscriber from the Department of Justice pursuant to this section shall be considered medical information subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act contained in Part 2.6 (commencing with Section 56) of Division 1 of the Civil Code.

The procedure created by this bill would, among other things, require the department to post the update on the department’s Internet Web site, notify stakeholders of the proposed change, submit notice of the proposed change to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the California Regulatory Notice Register, accept comments, and consider those comments prior to the adoption of the new standards.

This bill would instead define “eating disorders” to have the meaning of the term as defined in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as published by the American Psychiatric Association. By changing the definition of a crime applicable to health facilities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.

(d) While the HOT lanes have met their stated objectives, and while participation in the low-income assistance program has grown over time, improvements can be made.
(e) LACMTA and the department should continue to improve the overall performance of the HOT lanes, including identifying ways to improve travel speeds in both corridors.
(f) LACMTA and the department should continue to work to improve awareness of the low-income assistance program through advertising and working with local community groups and social service agencies to distribute information about the program.
(g) LACMTA should consider offering greater incentives in the low-income assistance program in order to incentivize participation in the program.
SEC. 2.
Section 149.9 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to read:
149.9.
(a) Notwithstanding Sections 149 and 30800 of this code, and Section 21655.5 of the Vehicle Code, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) may conduct, administer, and operate a value-pricing and transit development program involving high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in the County of Los Angeles. LACMTA, with the consent of the department, may direct and authorize the entry and use of the State Highway Routes 10 and 110 high-occupancy vehicle lanes by single-occupant vehicles and those vehicles that do not meet minimum occupancy requirements, as defined by LACMTA, for a fee. The amount of the fee shall be established by, and collected in a manner to be determined by, LACMTA. LACMTA may continue to require high-occupancy vehicles to have an electronic transponder or other electronic device for enforcement purposes.
(b) LACMTA shall implement the program in cooperation with the department, and with the active participation of the Department of the California Highway Patrol, pursuant to an agreement that addresses all matters related to design, construction, maintenance, and operation of state highway system facilities in connection with the program. With the consent of the department, LACMTA shall establish appropriate performance measures, such as speed or travel times, for the purpose of ensuring optimal use of the HOT lanes by high-occupancy vehicles without adversely affecting other traffic on the state highway system.
(1) Agreements between LACMTA, the department, and the Department of the California Highway Patrol shall identify the respective obligations and liabilities of each party to the agreement and assign them responsibilities relating to the program. The agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall be consistent with agreements between the department and the United States Department of Transportation relating to programs of this nature. The agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall include clear and concise procedures for enforcement by the Department of the California Highway Patrol of laws prohibiting the unauthorized use of the HOT lanes. The agreements shall provide for reimbursement of state agencies, from revenues generated by the program or other funding sources that are not otherwise available to state agencies for transportation-related projects, for costs incurred in connection with the implementation or operation of the program, as well as maintenance of state highway system facilities in connection with the program.
(2) All remaining revenue generated by the program shall be used in the corridor from which the revenue was generated exclusively for preconstruction, construction, and other related costs of high-occupancy vehicle facilities, transportation corridor improvements, and the improvement of transit service in the corridor, including, but not limited to, support for transit operations pursuant to an expenditure plan adopted by LACMTA. LACMTA’s administrative expenses related to the operation of the program shall not exceed 3 percent of the revenues.
(c) Single-occupant vehicles and those vehicles that do not meet minimum occupancy requirements that are certified or authorized by LACMTA for entry into, and use of, the State Highway Routes 10 and 110 high-occupancy vehicle lanes are exempt from Section 21655.5 of the Vehicle Code, and the driver shall not be in violation of the Vehicle Code because of that entry and use.
(d) (1) In implementing the program, LACMTA shall continue to work with the affected communities in the respective corridors and provide mitigation measures for commuters of low income, including reduced toll charges and toll credits for transit users. Eligible commuters for reduced toll charges or toll credits for transit users shall meet the eligibility requirements for assistance programs under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 12000) of Part 3 of, Part 5 (commencing with Section 17000) of, or Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 18900), Chapter 10.1 (commencing with Section 18930), or Chapter 10.3 (commencing with Section 18937) of Part 6 of, Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(2) Beyond the measures already implemented to create a low-income assistance program, LACMTA shall take additional steps to increase enrollment and participation in the low-income assistance program. LACMTA, in that regard, shall improve awareness of the low-income assistance program through advertising and by working with local community groups and social service agencies to distribute information about the low-income assistance program. In addition, LACMTA shall consider offering greater incentives to encourage participation in the low-income assistance program.
(e) (1) LACMTA and the department shall report to the Legislature by January 31, 2015. The report shall include, but not be limited to, a summary of the program, a survey of its users, the impact on carpoolers, revenues generated, how transit service or alternative modes of transportation were impacted, any potential effect on traffic congestion in the high-occupancy vehicle lanes and in the neighboring lanes, the number of toll-paying vehicles that utilized the HOT lanes, any potential reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions that are attributable to congestion reduction resulting from the HOT lane program, any comments submitted by the Department of the California Highway Patrol regarding operation of the lanes, and a description of the mitigation measures on the affected communities and commuters in the program. The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code. This subdivision shall become inoperative on January 31, 2019, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.
(2) LACMTA and the department shall report to the policy committees of the Legislature with responsibility for transportation matters by December 31, 2018, on the efforts to improve the program authorized by this section. The report shall address efforts by LACMTA to increase participation in the low-income participation program, any additional incentives that have been developed to encourage participation in the low-income participation program, and the performance of the HOT lanes overall in improving congestion in the affected corridors and offsetting the impact to low-income commuters. This paragraph shall become inoperative on January 1, 2021, pursuant to Section 10231.5 of the Government Code.
(f) Toll paying commuters shall have the option to purchase any necessary toll paying equipment, prepay tolls, and renew toll payments by cash or by using a credit card.
(g) This section shall not prevent the department or any local agency from constructing facilities that compete with a HOT lane program, and LACMTA shall not be entitled to compensation for adverse effects on toll revenue due to those facilities.
(h) LACMTA may issue bonds, as set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 130500) of Division 12 of the Public Utilities Code, at any time to finance any costs necessary to implement a value-pricing and transit development program established in accordance with this section and to finance any expenditures payable from the revenues generated from the program.","Existing law authorizes a value-pricing and transit development program involving high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes to be conducted, administered, developed, and operated on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in the County of Los Angeles by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) under certain conditions.
Existing law requires LACMTA, in implementing the program, to continue to work with the affected communities in the respective corridors and provide mitigation measures for commuters and transit users of low income, including reduced toll charges and toll credits. Existing law requires eligible commuters and transit users to meet the eligibility requirements for specified assistance programs.
This bill would require LACMTA to take additional steps, beyond the previous implementation of a low-income assistance program, to increase enrollment and participation in the low-income assistance program, as specified, through advertising and work with community organizations and social service agencies. The bill would also require LACMTA and the Department of Transportation to report to the Legislature by December 31, 2018, on efforts to improve the HOT lane program, including efforts to increase participation in the low-income assistance program.","An act to amend Section 149.9 of the Streets and Highways Code, relating to transportation."

This bill would, where an abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug product, as defined, is available, prohibit a health care service plan or insurer from requiring the use of opioid analgesic drug products without the abuse-deterrent properties in order to access abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products.

SECTION 1.
Section 41320.1 of the Education Code, as amended by Section 34 of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 2015, is amended to read:
41320.1.
Acceptance by the school district of the apportionments made pursuant to Section 41320 constitutes the agreement by the school district to all of the following conditions:
(a) The Superintendent shall appoint a trustee who has recognized expertise in management and finance and may employ, on a short-term basis, staff necessary to assist the trustee, including, but not limited to, certified public accountants, as follows:
(1) The expenses incurred by the trustee and necessary staff shall be borne by the school district.
(2) The Superintendent shall establish the terms and conditions of the employment, including the remuneration of the trustee. The trustee shall serve at the pleasure of, and report directly to, the Superintendent.
(3) The trustee, and necessary staff, shall serve until the school district has adequate fiscal systems and controls in place, the Superintendent has determined that the school district’s future compliance with the fiscal plan approved for the school district under Section 41320 is probable, and the Superintendent decides to terminate the trustee’s appointment, but in no event for less than three years. The Superintendent shall notify the county superintendent of schools, the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and the Controller no less than 60 days before the time that the Superintendent expects these conditions to be met.
(4) Before the school district repays the loan, including interest, the recipient of the loan shall select an auditor from a list established by the Superintendent and the Controller to conduct an audit of its fiscal systems. If the fiscal systems are deemed to be inadequate, the Superintendent may retain the trustee until the deficiencies are corrected. The cost of this audit and any additional cost of the trustee shall be borne by the school district.
(5) Notwithstanding any other law, all reports submitted to the trustee are public records.
(6) To facilitate the appointment of the trustee and the employment of necessary staff, for purposes of this section, the Superintendent is exempt from the requirements of Article 6 (commencing with Section 999) of Chapter 6 of Division 4 of the Military and Veterans Code and Part 2 (commencing with Section 10100) of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code.
(7) Notwithstanding any other law, the Superintendent may appoint an employee of the department to act as trustee for up to the duration of the trusteeship. The salary and benefits of that employee shall be established by the Superintendent and paid by the school district. During the time of appointment, the employee is an employee of the school district, but shall remain in the same retirement system under the same plan as if the employee had remained in the department. Upon the expiration or termination of the appointment, the employee shall have the right to return to his or her former position, or to a position at substantially the same level as that position, with the department. The time served in the appointment shall be counted for all purposes as if the employee had served that time in his or her former position with the department.
(b) (1) The trustee appointed by the Superintendent shall monitor and review the operation of the school district. During the period of his or her service, the trustee may stay or rescind an action of the governing board of the school district that, in the judgment of the trustee, may affect the financial condition of the school district.
(2) After the trustee’s period of service, and until the loan is repaid, the county superintendent of schools that has jurisdiction over the school district may stay or rescind an action of the governing board of the school district that, in his or her judgment, may affect the financial condition of the school district. The county superintendent of schools shall notify the Superintendent, within five business days, if he or she stays or rescinds an action of the governing board of the school district. The notice shall include, but not be limited to, both of the following:
(A) A description of the governing board of the school district’s intended action and its financial implications.
(B) The rationale and findings that support the county superintendent of school’s decision to stay or rescind the action of the governing board of the school district.
(3) If the Superintendent is notified by the county superintendent of schools pursuant to paragraph (2), the Superintendent shall report to the Legislature, on or before December 30 of every year, whether the school district is complying with the fiscal plan approved for the school district.
(4) The Superintendent may establish timelines and prescribe formats for reports and other materials to be used by the trustee to monitor and review the operations of the school district. The trustee shall approve or reject all reports and other materials required from the school district as a condition of receiving the apportionment. The Superintendent, upon the recommendation of the trustee, may reduce an apportionment to the school district in an amount up to two hundred dollars ($200) per day for each late or unacceptable report or other material required under this part, and shall report to the Legislature a failure of the school district to comply with the requirements of this section. If the Superintendent determines, at any time, that the fiscal plan approved for the school district under Section 41320 is unsatisfactory, he or she may modify the plan as necessary, and the school district shall comply with the plan as modified.
(c) At the request of the Superintendent, the Controller shall transfer to the department, from an apportionment to which the school district would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Section 42238.02, as implemented by Section 42238.03, the amount necessary to pay the expenses incurred by the trustee and associated costs incurred by the county superintendent of schools.
(d) For the fiscal year in which the apportionments are disbursed and every year thereafter, the Controller, or his or her designee, shall cause an audit to be conducted of the books and accounts of the school district, in lieu of the audit required by Section 41020. At the Controller’s discretion, the audit may be conducted by the Controller, his or her designee, or an auditor selected by the school district and approved by the Controller. The costs of these audits shall be borne by the school district. These audits shall be required until the Controller determines, in consultation with the Superintendent, that the school district is financially solvent, but in no event earlier than one year following the implementation of the plan or later than the time the apportionment made is repaid, including interest. For an audit conducted by the Controller, or his or her designee, the Controller, the Superintendent, and the school district superintendent, or their respective designees, shall meet before the audit to discuss the terms of the audit and the timeline under which it will proceed. In addition, the Controller shall conduct quality control reviews pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 14504.2.
(e) For purposes of errors and omissions liability insurance policies, the trustee appointed pursuant to this section is an employee of the local educational agency to which he or she is assigned. For purposes of workers’ compensation benefits, the trustee is an employee of the local educational agency to which he or she is assigned, except that a trustee appointed pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) is an employee of the department for those purposes.
(f) Except for an individual appointed by the Superintendent as trustee pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a), the state-appointed trustee is a member of the State Teachers’ Retirement System, if qualified, for the period of service as trustee, unless the trustee elects in writing not to become a member. A person who is a member or retirant of the State Teachers’ Retirement System at the time of appointment shall continue to be a member or retirant of the system for the duration of the appointment. If the trustee chooses to become a member or is already a member, the trustee shall be placed on the payroll of the school district for the purpose of providing appropriate contributions to the system. The Superintendent may also require that an individual appointed as trustee pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) be placed on the payroll of the school district for purposes of remuneration, other benefits, and payroll deductions. For purposes of workers’ compensation benefits, the state-appointed trustee is deemed an employee of the local educational agency to which he or she is assigned, except that a trustee who is appointed pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) is an employee of the department for those purposes.","Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to request an emergency apportionment through the Superintendent of Public Instruction if the governing board of the school district determines during a fiscal year that its revenues are less than the amount necessary to meet its current year expenditure obligations. Under existing law, if a school district accepts an emergency apportionment, that acceptance constitutes agreement by the school district to numerous conditions, among which is an agreement that the Controller, or his or her designee, or an auditor selected by the school district and approved by the Controller shall conduct an annual audit of the books and accounts of the school district, as specified. This provision requires these audits to continue until the Controller determines, in consultation with the Superintendent, that the school district is financially solvent, but in no event earlier than one year following the implementation of the school district’s fiscal plan or later than the time the apportionment is repaid, including interest.
This bill, for an audit conducted by the Controller, or his or her designee, would require the Controller, the Superintendent, and the school district superintendent, or their respective designees, to meet before the audit to discuss the terms of the audit and the timeline under which it will proceed.","An act to amend Section 41320.1 of the Education Code, relating to school finance."

(f) A waiver of the rights granted by this section is void and contrary to public policy, provided, however, that (1) upon receipt of a claim, the parties may mutually agree to waive, in writing, mediation and proceed directly to the commencement of a civil action or binding arbitration, as applicable; and (2) a public entity may prescribe reasonable change order, claim, and dispute resolution procedures and requirements in addition to the provisions of this section, so long as the contractual provisions do not conflict with or otherwise impair the timeframes and procedures set forth in this section.
(g) This section applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law prescribes various requirements regarding the formation, content, and enforcement of state and local public contracts. Existing law applicable to state public contracts generally requires that the resolution of claims related to those contracts be subject to arbitration. Existing law applicable to local agency contracts prescribes a process for the resolution of claims related to those contracts of $375,000 or less.
This bill would establish, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017, a claim resolution process applicable to any claim by a contractor in connection with a public works project. The bill would define a claim as a separate demand by the contractor for one or more of the following: a time extension for relief from damages or penalties for delay, payment of money or damages arising from work done pursuant to the contract for a public work, or payment of an amount disputed by the public entity, as specified.
This bill would require a public entity, defined to exclude certain state entities, upon receipt of a claim sent by registered or certified mail, to review it and, within 45 days, provide a written statement identifying the disputed and undisputed portions of the claim. The bill would authorize the 45-day period to be extended by mutual agreement. The bill would require any payment due on an undisputed portion of the claim to be processed within 60 days, as specified. The bill would require that the claim be deemed rejected in its entirety if the public entity fails to issue the written statement.
This bill would authorize, if the claimant disputes the public entity’s written response or if the public entity fails to respond to a claim within the time prescribed, the claimant to demand to meet and confer for settlement of the issues in dispute. The bill would require any disputed portion of the claim that remains in dispute after the meet and confer conference to be subject to nonbinding mediation, as specified. The bill would provide that unpaid claim amounts accrue interest at 7% per annum. The bill would prescribe a procedure by which a subcontractor or lower tier contractor may make a claim through the contractor.
This bill would require the text of these provisions, or a summary, to be set forth in the plans or specifications for any public work which may give rise to a claim. The bill would specify that a waiver of these rights is void and contrary to public policy, except as specified. The bill would also specify that it does not impose liability on a public entity that makes loans or grants available through a competitive application process, for the failure of an awardee to meet its contractual obligations.
By increasing the duties of local agencies and officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, on January 1, 2020, repeal the provision establishing the claim resolution process.
This bill would specify that these provisions constitute a matter of statewide concern.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add and repeal Section 9204 of the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts."

The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. The bill would specify that failure to comply with this requirement for a new oath or affirmation is not punishable as a crime.
Existing law requires the written appointment of a deputy of a county official to be filed as specified.
This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new appointment to be filed within 10 days of a legal change in name, delegated authority, or department by an appointed deputy of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied.
Violating an oath or affirmation is a crime. Because this bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 1363, 3105, and 24102 of the Government Code, relating to public employment."

SECTION 1.
Section 21628 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
21628.
(a) Every secondhand dealer or coin dealer described in Section 21626 shall report daily, or on the first working day after receipt or purchase of secondhand tangible personal property, on forms or through an electronic reporting system approved by the Department of Justice, all secondhand tangible personal property, except for firearms, which he or she has purchased, taken in trade, taken in pawn, accepted for sale on consignment, or accepted for auctioning, to the chief of police or to the sheriff, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 21630 and 21633 and subdivision (d).

The verification shall be valid if the person taking the information reasonably relies on any one of the following documents, provided that the document is currently valid or has been issued within five years and contains a photograph or description, or both, of the person named on it, and, where applicable, is signed by the person, and bears a serial or other identifying number:

Watches need not be disassembled when special skill or special tools are required to obtain the required information, unless specifically requested to do so by a peace officer. A special tool does not include a penknife, caseknife, or similar instrument and disassembling a watch with a penknife, caseknife, or similar instrument does not constitute a special skill. In all instances where the required information may be obtained by removal of a watchband, then the watchband shall be removed. The cost associated with opening the watch shall be borne by the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, or customer.
(B) In the case of the receipt or purchase of a handheld electronic device by a secondhand dealer, the serial number reported pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), the mobile equipment identifier (MEID), or other unique identifying number assigned to that device by the device manufacturer. If none of these identifying numbers are available by the time period required for reporting pursuant to this subdivision, the report shall be updated with the IMEI, MEID, or other unique identifying number assigned to that device by the device manufacturer as soon as reasonably possible but no later than 10 working days after receipt or purchase of the handheld electronic device.

(5) A certification by the intended seller or pledger that he or she is the owner of the property or has the authority of the owner to sell or pledge the property.
(6) A certification by the intended seller or pledger that to his or her knowledge and belief the information is true and complete.
(7) A legible fingerprint taken from the intended seller or pledger, as prescribed by the Department of Justice. This requirement does not apply to a coin dealer, unless required pursuant to local regulation.
(b) (1) When a secondhand dealer complies with all of the provisions of this section, he or she shall be deemed to have received from the seller or pledger adequate evidence of authority to sell or pledge the property for all purposes included in this article, and Division 8 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Financial Code.
(2) In enacting this subdivision, it is the intent of the Legislature that its provisions shall not adversely affect the implementation of, or prosecution under, any provision of the Penal Code.
(c) Any person who conducts business as a secondhand dealer at any gun show or event, as defined in Section 478.100 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or its successor, outside the jurisdiction that issued the secondhand dealer license in accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 21641, may be required to submit a duplicate of the transaction report prepared pursuant to this section to the local law enforcement agency where the gun show or event is conducted.
(d) (1) The Department of Justice shall, in consultation with appropriate local law enforcement agencies, develop clear and comprehensive descriptive categories denoting tangible personal property, as detailed in this section, subject to the reporting requirements of this section. These categories shall be incorporated by secondhand dealers and coin dealers described in Section 21626 for purposes of the reporting requirements set forth herein.
(2) With the consultation by the Department of Justice with local law enforcement agencies and representatives from the secondhand dealer businesses, pursuant to Resolution Chapter 16 of the Statutes of 2010, and upon the availability of sufficient funds in the Secondhand Dealer and Pawnbroker Fund created pursuant to Section 21642.5, the department shall promptly develop a single, statewide, uniform electronic reporting system to be used to transmit these secondhand dealer reports.
(3) (A) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any report required of a secondhand dealer shall be transmitted by electronic means.
(B) Until the date that the Department of Justice implements the single, statewide, uniform electronic reporting system described in paragraph (2), each secondhand dealer may continue to report the information required by this section under the reporting categories described in paragraph (1) in paper format on forms approved of or provided by the Department of Justice.
(C) On and after the date that the Department of Justice implements the single, statewide, uniform electronic reporting system described in paragraph (2), each secondhand dealer shall electronically report using that system the information required by this section under the reporting categories described in paragraph (2), except that for the first 30 days following the implementation date, each secondhand dealer shall also report the information in paper format as described in subparagraph (B).
(4) A coin dealer shall report the information required by this section under the reporting categories described in paragraph (1) on a form developed by the Attorney General that the coin dealer shall transmit each day by facsimile transmission or by mail to the chief of police or sheriff. A transaction shall consist of not more than one item.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “item” shall mean any single physical article. However, with respect to a commonly accepted grouping of articles that are purchased as a set, including, but not limited to, a pair of earrings or place settings of china, silverware, or other tableware, “item” shall mean that commonly accepted grouping.
(6) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as excepting a secondhand dealer from the fingerprinting requirement of paragraph (7) of subdivision (a).
(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a person licensed as a firearms dealer pursuant to Sections 26700 to 26915, inclusive, of the Penal Code from the reporting requirements for the delivery of firearms pursuant to Sections 26700 to 26915, inclusive, of the Penal Code.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law provides for the regulation of secondhand dealers, as defined. Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of a secondhand dealer without a license issued by the chief of police, the sheriff, or, where appropriate, the police commission. Existing law requires a secondhand dealer or coin dealer, as defined, to report, as specified, to the chief of police or sheriff all secondhand “tangible personal property,” as defined, purchased, taken in trade, taken in pawn, accepted for sale on consignment, or accepted for auctioning. Existing law requires the report to include, among other things, the identification of the intended seller or pledger of the property, verified by the person taking the information by reasonably relying on specified documents, and a complete and reasonably accurate description of serialized property, including, but not limited to, the serial number of that property. A violation of these provisions where a person knows or should have known that a violation was being committed is a misdemeanor.
This bill would permit the person verifying the identification of the seller or pledger to use technology to obtain information and verify identity remotely. The bill would authorize specified unique identifying numbers to be used as the serial number reported for handheld electronic devices, as defined, and would require the report to the chief of police or sheriff to be updated within 10 days with these unique identifying numbers if they were not available when the report was submitted.
Because a violation of this requirement under certain circumstances would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 21628 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to business."

(b)The records shall be made available for inspection at the office where the records are maintained. Upon receipt of an authenticated written request from a member along with the fee prescribed by the governing body to defray the costs of reproduction, the managing entity or other custodian of records of the association or the time-share plan shall prepare and transmit to the member a copy of any and all records requested.
(c)The governing body shall establish reasonable rules with respect to all of the following:

The association shall update this list no less frequently than every six months. The association shall not publish this list or provide a copy of it to any third party, or use or sell the list for commercial purposes. The association shall provide a copy of the list to a member for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association. However, notwithstanding this requirement, if the association reasonably believes that the recipient of the list will use the list for another purpose or provide a copy or disclose the contents to another party, the association shall refuse to provide the member a copy of the list.
(2)(A)If an owner of a time-share interest in the time-share plan makes a request to the association to communicate by mail with the membership of the association for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, and the board of administration of the association or the managing entity determines that the mailing pertains to a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, the requested mailing shall be made within 30 days after receipt of a request and payment by the owner of actual costs in accordance with subparagraph (B). If the board or managing entity determines that the requested mailing does not pertain to a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, the board or the managing entity shall, within 30 days after receipt of the request, notify the requesting owner in writing and shall indicate the reasons for the rejection.
(B)The owner who requests the mailing shall pay the association in advance for the association’s actual costs in performing the mailing. The association shall make a good faith effort to minimize the costs of the mailing, including the use of a less expensive delivery method, including electronic delivery.
(C)If the board of administration or managing entity does not distribute the requested communication within 30 days after receipt of a request from an owner and payment of actual costs, the superior court in the county where the time-share plan is located may, upon application from the requesting owner, summarily order the distribution of the requested communication. To the extent possible, the superior court shall dispose of an application on an expedited basis. In the event the court orders the distribution of the requested communication, it may order the board or managing entity to pay the owner’s costs, including attorney’s fees reasonably incurred to enforce the owner’s rights, unless the board or the managing entity can prove it refused to distribute the communication in good faith because of a reasonable belief that the requested communication did not pertain to a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association.

(f)For single site time-share plans and component sites of a multisite time-share plan located outside of the state, the association shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this section. The association must be in compliance with the applicable laws of the state or jurisdiction in which the time-share property or component site is located, and if a conflict exists between laws of the situs state and the requirements set forth in this section, the law of the situs state shall control. If the association and the time-share instruments provide for the matters contained in this section, the association shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section and neither the developer nor the association shall be required to make revisions to the time-share instruments in order to comply with the section.","Existing law provides for the disposition of a testator’s property by will.

Existing law prohibits an association from publishing the owners list or providing a copy of it to any time-share interest owner or to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes, except as provided in the time-share instruments.
This bill would require the owner addresses in the list to be mailing addresses, and would prohibit the association from publishing the list or providing a copy of it to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes. The bill would require the association to provide a copy of the list to an owner for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, except as specified.

SECTION 1.
Section 67380 of the Education Code is amended to read:
67380.
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (6), the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing board of any postsecondary educational institution receiving public funds for student financial assistance shall do all of the following:
(1) Require the appropriate officials at each campus within their respective jurisdictions to compile records of both of the following:

(3) (A) Make the information concerning the crimes compiled pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) available within two business days following the request of any student or employee of, or applicant for admission to, any campus within their respective jurisdictions, or to the media, unless the information is the type of information exempt from disclosure pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 6254 of the Government Code, in which case the information is not required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding subdivision (f) of Section 6254 of the Government Code, the name or any other personally identifying information of a victim of any crime defined by Section 243.4, 261, 262, 264, 264.1, 273a, 273d, 273.5, 286, 288, 288a, 289, 422.6, 422.7, or 422.75 of the Penal Code shall not be disclosed without the permission of the victim, or the victim’s parent or guardian if the victim is a minor.

It is the intent of the Legislature that the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing board of any postsecondary educational institution receiving public funds for student financial assistance establish guidelines for identifying and reporting occurrences of hate violence. It is the intent of the Legislature that the guidelines established by these institutions of higher education be as consistent with each other as possible. These guidelines shall be developed in consultation with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the California Association of Human Relations Organizations.
(6) (A) Notwithstanding subdivision (f) of Section 6254 of the Government Code, require any report made by a victim or an employee pursuant to Section 67383 of a Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, as described in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code, received by a campus security authority and made by the victim for purposes of notifying the institution or law enforcement, to be immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, disclosed to the local law enforcement agency with which the institution has a written agreement pursuant to Section 67381 without identifying the victim, unless the victim consents to being identified after the victim has been informed of his or her right to have his or her personally identifying information withheld. If the victim does not consent to being identified, the alleged assailant shall not be identified in the information disclosed to the local law enforcement agency, unless the institution determines both of the following, in which case the institution shall disclose the identity of the alleged assailant to the local law enforcement agency and shall immediately inform the victim of that disclosure:
(i) The alleged assailant represents a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of students, employees, or the institution.
(ii) The immediate assistance of the local law enforcement agency is necessary to contact or detain the assailant.
(B) The requirements of this paragraph shall not constitute a waiver of, or exception to, any law providing for the confidentiality of information.
(C) This paragraph applies only as a condition for participation in the Cal Grant Program established pursuant to Chapter 1.7 (commencing with Section 69430) of Part 42.
(b) Any person who is refused information required to be made available pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) may maintain a civil action for damages against any institution that refuses to provide the information, and the court shall award that person an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) if the court finds that the institution refused to provide the information.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Hate violence” means any act of physical intimidation or physical harassment, physical force or physical violence, or the threat of physical force or physical violence, that is directed against any person or group of persons, or the property of any person or group of persons because of the ethnicity, race, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, or political or religious beliefs of that person or group.
(2) “Part 1 violent crime” means willful homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, as defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
(3) “Sexual assault” includes, but is not limited to, rape, forced sodomy, forced oral copulation, rape by a foreign object, sexual battery, or the threat of any of these.
(d) This section does not apply to the governing board of a private postsecondary educational institution receiving funds for student financial assistance with a full-time enrollment of less than 1,000 students.
(e) This section shall apply to a campus of one of the public postsecondary educational systems identified in subdivision (a) only if that campus has a full-time equivalent enrollment of more than 1,000 students.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this section shall not apply to the California Community Colleges unless and until the Legislature makes funds available to the California Community Colleges for the purposes of this section.","Existing law requires the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of postsecondary educational institutions receiving public funds for student financial assistance to require the appropriate officials at each campus to compile records of specified crimes and noncriminal acts reported to campus police, campus security personnel, campus safety authorities, or designated campus authorities. Existing law requires, as a condition of participation in a specified financial aid program, any report by a victim of a Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, as defined, received by a campus security authority and made by the victim for purposes of notifying the institution or law enforcement, to be immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, disclosed to the appropriate local law enforcement agency without identifying the victim, unless the victim consents to being identified after the victim has been informed of his or her right to have his or her personally identifying information withheld. Existing law prohibits this report to a local law enforcement agency from identifying the alleged assailant if the victim does not consent to being identified.
This bill would authorize the identification of the alleged assailant, even if the victim does not consent to being identified, if the institution determines both that the alleged assailant represents a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of students, employees, or the institution, and that the immediate assistance of the local law enforcement agency is necessary to contact or detain the assailant. In that case, the bill would require the institution, as a condition of participation in the financial aid program, to disclose the identity of the alleged assailant to the local law enforcement agency and to immediately inform the victim of that disclosure.
This bill also would make conforming and nonsubstantive changes.","An act to amend Section 67380 of the Education Code, relating to postsecondary education."

SECTION 1.
Section 53075.5 of the Government Code is amended to read:
53075.5.
(a) Notwithstanding Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 5351) of Division 2 of the Public Utilities Code, every city or county shall protect the public health, safety, and welfare by adopting an ordinance or resolution in regard to taxicab transportation service rendered in vehicles designed for carrying not more than eight persons, excluding the driver, which is operated within the jurisdiction of the city or county.
(b) Each city or county shall provide for, but is not limited to providing for, the following:
(1) A policy for entry into the business of providing taxicab transportation service. The policy shall include, but need not be limited to, all of the following provisions:

Drivers shall test negative for these controlled substances and for alcohol as a condition of permit renewal or, if no periodic permit renewals are required, at such other times as the city or county shall designate. As used in this section, a negative test for alcohol means an alcohol screening test showing a breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent.
(ii) Procedures shall be substantially as in Part 40 (commencing with Section 40.1) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, except that the driver shall show a valid California driver’s license at the time and place of testing, and except as provided otherwise in this section.

(6) A city or county shall not regulate the type of device used by a taxicab company to calculate fares, including the use of global positioning system metering as a form of calculating fares. Taxicab companies shall disclose fares, fees, or rates to the customer before the customer accepts the ride so that the customer can make a knowledgeable decision. A taxicab company may disclose fares, fees, or rates on its Internet Web site or cellular telephone application.
(7) Local rules and regulations adopted prior to July 1, 2016, that ensure adequate service levels to all areas of a city’s or county’s jurisdiction and promote use of taxicab transportation services by individuals covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) shall remain in effect.

(a) Regulation of taxicab transportation services shall be modernized in order for taxicabs to better compete with all for-hire modes of transportation.
(b) Taxicab regulation shall be moved from the patchwork of various local requirements to one state agency to coincide with the Governor’s reorganization of transportation.
(c) Duties and responsibilities for the regulation of taxicab transportation services shall be established by state departments within the agency that handles all other modes of for-hire transportation.
(d) The Governor shall propose the specific budget and statutory changes needed to establish duties and responsibilities to the agency that handles all other modes of for-hire transportation.

(f) A city or county shall not impose any rule or regulation governing taxicab transportation services that is inconsistent with or in addition to the requirements established by state departments within the agency that handles all other modes of for-hire transportation.
SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that taxicabs face a substantial competitive disadvantage due to the numerous and differing requirements from city to city while all other modes of for-hire transportation are regulated by one statewide entity, and, therefore, the regulation of taxicab transportation services and taxicab drivers is an issue of statewide concern and not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution. Therefore, this act shall apply to charter cities and charter counties.
SEC. 5.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique medallion system of the City and County of San Francisco.
SEC. 6.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires every city or county to adopt an ordinance or resolution in regard to taxicab transportation service and requires each city or county to provide for a policy for entry into the business of providing taxicab transportation service, establishment or registration of rates for the provision of taxicab transportation service, and a mandatory controlled substance and alcohol testing certification program for drivers, as specified.
This bill would make those provisions inapplicable to a city or county, other than the City and County of San Francisco, on the date upon which the Director of Finance notifies the Speaker of the Assembly and the President pro Tempore of the Senate of the completion of a state reorganization of transportation duties from the Public Utilities Commission to other agencies, if taxicab transportation services are included in the reorganization. The bill would require taxicab transportation services and taxicab drivers to be subject to rules or regulations adopted by cities and counties as they existed on July 1, 2016, except for requirements specified in the bill that would apply to cities and counties, including charter cities and counties, other than the City and County of San Francisco. By imposing new duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair. The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that, among other things, regulation of taxicab transportation services shall be modernized and moved to one state agency.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 53075.5 of, and to add Sections 53075.71 and 53075.72 to, the Government Code, relating to transportation."

Setting the fee amounts authorized pursuant to subdivision (a) shall not be subject to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The secretary shall only have the authority to raise an additional fee pursuant to this section upon recommendation of the Rendering Industry Advisory Board.
(c) An individual registered pursuant to this article who transports inedible kitchen grease for his or her own personal, noncommercial use as an alternative fuel is exempt from 75 percent of the fee charged pursuant to subdivision (a), and shall meet all of the following requirements:
(1) The individual shall meet all other requirements of this article.
(2) The individual shall not transport more than 55 gallons of inedible kitchen grease per load for that purpose, and shall have no more than 165 gallons of inedible kitchen grease in his or her possession or control at any time.
(3) The individual shall not take any inedible kitchen grease from a container owned by another registered transporter of inedible kitchen grease or from an inedible kitchen grease provider under contract with a registered transporter of inedible kitchen grease or from a container owned by a renderer or collection center.
(4) The individual shall have a document in his or her possession while transporting inedible kitchen grease signed by the responsible party providing the inedible kitchen grease to the individual at the source of the inedible kitchen grease that provides permission for the inedible kitchen grease to be removed from that site.
(5) The individual shall specify where the inedible kitchen grease is stored and processed as an alternative fuel, if that address is different from the address included on the registration form for that individual pursuant to Section 19312.
(6) The individual shall not sell, barter, or trade any inedible kitchen grease.
(d) The secretary shall fix the additional fees established pursuant to this section and may fix different fees for transporters of inedible kitchen grease and collection centers, and for transporters of interceptor grease. If an additional fee is imposed on licensed renderers pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 19227 and an additional fee is imposed on registered transporters pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, only one additional fee may be imposed on a person or firm that is both licensed as a renderer pursuant to Article 6 (commencing with Section 19300) and registered as a transporter of inedible kitchen grease pursuant to this article, which fee shall be the higher of the two fees.
(e) If the additional fee established pursuant to this section is not paid within one calendar month of the date it is due, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount of 10 percent per annum on the amount of the unpaid fee.
(f) For purposes of this section, “interceptor grease” means inedible kitchen grease that is principally derived from food preparation, processing, or waste, and that is removed from a grease trap or grease interceptor.
(g) This section shall become inoperative on July 1, 2020, and, as of January 1, 2021, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, which becomes effective on or before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.","(1) Existing law regulates rendering, which is defined as the recycling, processing, and conversion of, among other things, inedible kitchen grease. Existing law, operative until July 1, 2020, authorizes the Department of Food and Agriculture, in addition to the license fee, to charge each licensed renderer and collection center an additional fee to cover the reasonable costs of administering provisions regulating renderers, collection centers, and transporters of inedible kitchen grease, and requires that the additional fees may not exceed $3,000 per year.
This bill would increase the maximum amount of these additional fees to $10,000 per year.
(2) Existing law requires transporters of inedible kitchen grease to be registered and to pay a $100 registration fee. Existing law, operative until July 1, 2020, authorizes the department, except as specified, to charge an additional fee not to exceed $300 per year per vehicle that is operated to transport kitchen grease for purposes of administering the provisions regulating these transporters, up to a maximum of $3,000 per year per registered transporter.
This bill would increase the registration fee for transporters of inedible kitchen grease to not to exceed $250. The bill would also increase the additional fee to not to exceed $500 per year per vehicle that is operated to transport kitchen grease and the maximum to not exceed $10,000 per year per registered transporter.
(3) This bill would also authorize the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, based upon the findings and recommendation of the Rendering Industry Advisory Board, to determine the additional fee amounts, as described above under (1) and (2), necessary to provide the revenue needed to carry out these provisions. The bill would require the secretary and the board to not exceed the maximum amount for additional fees authorized pursuant to these provisions. The bill would provide that the secretary shall only have the authority to raise an additional fee upon recommendation of the board. The bill would exempt the setting of these additional fees from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
(4) Existing law requires fees collected pursuant to these provisions to be deposited into the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund and continuously appropriates the collected funds for the purposes described above.
By increasing these additional fees and the registration fee for transporters of inedible kitchen grease, which are deposited into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.","An act to amend Sections 19227, 19312, and 19315 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to rendering, and making an appropriation therefor."

585,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 4011.10 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
4011.10.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to provide county sheriffs, chiefs of police, and directors or administrators of local detention facilities with an incentive to not engage in practices designed to avoid payment of legitimate health care costs for the treatment or examination of persons lawfully in their custody, and to promptly pay those costs as requested by the provider of services. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature to encourage county sheriffs, chiefs of police, and directors or administrators of local detention facilities to bargain in good faith when negotiating a service contract with hospitals providing health care services.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services, may contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Hospitals that do not contract for health care services with the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency shall provide health care services to local law enforcement patients at a rate equal to 110 percent of the hospital’s actual costs according to the most recent Hospital Annual Financial Data report issued by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, as calculated using a cost-to-charge ratio, or, for claims that have not previously been paid or otherwise determined by local law enforcement, according to the most recently approved cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program. The hospital, with the approval of the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, may choose the most appropriate cost-to-charge ratio and shall provide notice to the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency, as applicable, of any change. If the hospital uses the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, the hospital shall attach supporting Medicare documentation and an expected payment calculation to the claim. If a claim does not contain the supporting Medicare documentation and expected payment calculation, or if, within 60 days of the hospital’s request for approval to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, approval is not granted by the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development cost-to-charge ratio shall be used to calculate the payment.
(c) A county sheriff or police chief shall not request the release of an inmate from custody for the purpose of allowing the inmate to seek medical care at a hospital, and then immediately rearrest the same individual upon discharge from the hospital, unless the hospital determines this action would enable it to bill and collect from a third-party payment source.
(d) The California Hospital Association, the University of California, the California State Sheriffs’ Association, and the California Police Chiefs Association shall, immediately upon enactment of this section, convene the Inmate Health Care and Medical Provider Fair Pricing Working Group. The working group shall consist of at least six members from the California Hospital Association and the University of California, and six members from the California State Sheriffs’ Association and the California Police Chiefs Association. Each organization should give great weight and consideration to appointing members of the working group with diverse geographic and demographic interests. The working group shall meet as needed to identify and resolve industry issues that create fiscal barriers to timely and affordable inmate health care. In addition, the working group shall address issues, including, but not limited to, inmates being admitted for care and later rearrested and any other fiscal barriers to hospitals being able to enter into fair market contracts with public agencies. To the extent that the rate provisions of this statute result in a disproportionate share of local law enforcement patients being treated at any one hospital or system of hospitals, the working group shall address this issue. No reimbursement is required under this provision.
(e) This section does not require or encourage a hospital or public agency to replace any existing arrangements that any city police chief, county sheriff, or other public agency that contracts for health care services for local law enforcement patients has with health care providers.
(f) An entity that provides ambulance or any other emergency or nonemergency response service to a sheriff or police chief, and that does not contract with their departments for that service, shall be reimbursed for the service at the rate established by Medicare. Neither the sheriff nor the police chief shall reimburse a provider of any of these services that his or her department has not contracted with at a rate that exceeds the provider’s reasonable and allowable costs, regardless of whether the provider is located within or outside of California.
(g) For the purposes of this section, “reasonable and allowable costs” shall be defined in accordance with Part 413 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations and federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Publication Numbers 15-1 and 15-2.
(h) For purposes of this section, in those counties in which the sheriff does not administer a jail facility, a director or administrator of a local department of corrections established pursuant to Section 23013 of the Government Code is the person who may contract for services provided to jail inmates in the facilities he or she administers in those counties.","Existing federal law provides for the federal Medicare Program, which is a public health insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with disabilities who are under 65 years of age.
Existing law authorizes a county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services, to contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Existing law requires hospitals that do not contract with the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services to provide health care services to local law enforcement patients at a rate equal to 110% of the hospital’s actual costs according to the most recent Hospital Annual Financial Data report issued by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, as calculated using a cost-to-charge ratio.
This bill would authorize, for claims that have not previously been paid or otherwise determined by local law enforcement, those costs to be calculated according to the most recent approved cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program. The bill would authorize the hospital, with the approval of the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, to choose which cost-to-charge ratio is most appropriate, and would require the hospital to give notice of any change. If the hospital chooses to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, the bill would require the hospital to attach supporting Medicare documentation and an expected payment calculation to the claim. If a claim does not contain that documentation and payment calculation, or if, within 60 days of the hospital’s request for approval to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, approval is not granted by the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, the bill would require the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development cost-to-charge ratio to be used to calculate the payment. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes.","An act to amend Section 4011.10 of the Penal Code, relating to health care."

(3) (A) The inspector general shall be subject to the direction of the Governor.
(B) The inspector general shall provide ongoing and independent advice to the board regarding any issue that is being considered by the board.
(b) The inspector general shall be responsible for all of the following:
(1) Reviewing the operations and financial condition of each California veterans home and veterans farm and home purchase program. For the purposes of reviewing the operations of each veterans home, the Veterans Home Allied Council and home residents shall have unfettered access to the inspector general.
(2) Reviewing the operation and financial condition of all other veterans programs supported by the state including, but not limited to, county veterans service offices and veterans memorials.
(3) Investigating any allegations of department employee misconduct and reporting any findings of misconduct directly to the secretary, for further action that the secretary may deem necessary.
(c) (1) The inspector general shall conduct a review or investigation, as specified in subdivision (b), if requested to do so by the Governor, any member of the board, or the secretary. In addition, the inspector general may conduct a review or investigation, as specified in subdivision (b), as he or she deems necessary or if requested by any Member of the Legislature or any member of the public.
(2) Whenever the inspector general conducts a review or investigation pursuant to a request of any Member of the Legislature, the inspector general shall submit a report of his or her findings to that member.
(d) (1) Beginning January 1, 2017, and each year after, the inspector general shall submit a report to the board and the Legislature and make any recommendations he or she deems necessary for improving the operations of the veterans programs.
(2) A report submitted to the Legislature pursuant to paragraph (1) shall comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(3) This subdivision shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
Section 73.6 is added to the Military and Veterans Code, to read:
73.6.
(a) The inspector general may receive communications from any individual, including, but not limited to, a participant in a farm and home purchase program or a resident of a California veterans home, who believes he or she may have information that warrants a review or investigation of a veterans program that is supported by the state. The identity of the person providing the information shall be held as confidential by the inspector general and may be disclosed only to the Governor, any member of the board, any Member of the Legislature, or the secretary, as the inspector general deems appropriate and in the furtherance of his or her duties.
(b) In order to properly respond to any allegation, the inspector general shall establish a toll-free public telephone number for the purpose of identifying any alleged wrongdoing regarding veterans programs. This telephone number shall be posted at every California veterans home and throughout all department and county veterans service offices, in clear view of all veterans home residents, employees, and the public. In addition, the telephone number shall be issued to every participant of a home purchase program. When deemed appropriate by the inspector general, he or she shall initiate a review or investigation of any alleged wrongdoing. However, any request to conduct an investigation shall be in writing. The request shall be confidential and is not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).
(c) The identity of the person providing the information that initiated the review or investigation shall not be disclosed without that person’s written permission, except to a law enforcement agency in the furtherance of its duties.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 73.6 of the Military and Veterans Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the privacy of persons who provide information of alleged wrongdoing by or complaints against veterans programs to the Inspector General for Veterans Affairs, the limitations on the public’s right of access imposed by Section 2 of this act are necessary.","Existing law establishes the Department of Veterans Affairs and designates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as the chief administrative officer of the department. Existing law also establishes the California Veterans Board, and requires the board to advise the department and secretary on policies for operations of the department. Existing law provides for veterans programs, including the veterans farm and home purchase programs, and provides for veterans homes.
This bill would create the office of Inspector General for Veterans Affairs, who would be subject to the direction of the Governor, within the department. The bill would require the inspector general to be appointed by the Governor, subject to Senate confirmation. The inspector general would be responsible for reviewing the operations and financial condition of each California veterans home, each veterans farm and home purchase program, and all other veterans programs supported by the state. Beginning January 1, 2017, and each year after, the bill would require the inspector general to submit a report to the board and the Legislature and make any recommendations he or she deems necessary for improving the operations of the veterans programs. The bill would repeal the reporting requirement on January 1, 2020.
The bill would authorize the inspector general to receive communications from any individual who believes he or she may have information that warrants a review or investigation of a veterans program. The bill would authorize, and in some instances require, the inspector general to conduct a review or investigation. The bill would also require the establishment of a toll-free telephone number to report alleged wrongdoing regarding veterans programs.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Sections 73.5 and 73.6 to the Military and Veterans Code, relating to veterans."

(B) The real estate instrument, paper, or notice is recorded concurrently with a document subject to a documentary transfer tax pursuant to Section 11911 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(C) The real estate instrument, paper, or notice is presented for recording within the same business day as, and is related to the recording of, a document subject to a documentary transfer tax pursuant to Section 11911 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. A real estate instrument, paper, or notice that is exempt under this subparagraph shall be accompanied by a statement that includes both of the following:
(i) A statement that the real estate instrument, paper, or notice is exempt from the fee imposed under paragraph (1).
(ii) A statement of the recording date and the recorder identification number or book and page of the previously recorded document.
(b) Money placed in the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund shall be expended to fund programs to enhance the capacity of local police and prosecutors to deter, investigate, and prosecute real estate fraud crimes. After deduction of the actual and necessary administrative costs referred to in subdivision (a), 60 percent of the funds shall be distributed to district attorneys subject to review pursuant to subdivision (d), and 40 percent of the funds shall be distributed to local law enforcement agencies within the county in accordance with subdivision (c). In those counties where the investigation of real estate fraud is done exclusively by the district attorney, after deduction of the actual and necessary administrative costs referred to in subdivision (a), 100 percent of the funds shall be distributed to the district attorney, subject to review pursuant to subdivision (d). A portion of the funds may be directly allocated to the county recorder to support county recorder fraud prevention programs, including, but not limited to, the fraud prevention program provided for in Section 27297.7. Prior to establishing or increasing fees pursuant to this section, the board of supervisors may consider support for county recorder fraud prevention programs. The funds so distributed shall be expended for the exclusive purpose of deterring, investigating, and prosecuting real estate fraud crimes.
(c) The county auditor or director of finance shall distribute funds in the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund to eligible law enforcement agencies within the county pursuant to subdivision (b), as determined by a Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund Committee composed of the district attorney, the county chief administrative officer, the chief officer responsible for consumer protection within the county, and the chief law enforcement officer of one law enforcement agency receiving funding from the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund, the latter being selected by a majority of the other three members of the committee. The chief law enforcement officer shall be a nonvoting member of the committee and shall serve a one-year term, which may be renewed. Members may appoint representatives of their offices to serve on the committee. If a county lacks a chief officer responsible for consumer protection, the county board of supervisors may appoint an appropriate representative to serve on the committee. The committee shall establish and publish deadlines and written procedures for local law enforcement agencies within the county to apply for the use of funds and shall review applications and make determinations by majority vote as to the award of funds using the following criteria:
(1) Each law enforcement agency that seeks funds shall submit a written application to the committee setting forth in detail the agency’s proposed use of the funds.
(2) In order to qualify for receipt of funds, each law enforcement agency submitting an application shall provide written evidence that the agency either:
(A) Has a unit, division, or section devoted to the investigation or prosecution of real estate fraud, or both, and the unit, division, or section has been in existence for at least one year prior to the application date.
(B) Has on a regular basis, during the three years immediately preceding the application date, accepted for investigation or prosecution, or both, and assigned to specific persons employed by the agency, cases of suspected real estate fraud, and actively investigated and prosecuted those cases.
(3) The committee’s determination to award funds to a law enforcement agency shall be based on, but not be limited to, (A) the number of real estate fraud cases filed in the prior year; (B) the number of real estate fraud cases investigated in the prior year; (C) the number of victims involved in the cases filed; and (D) the total aggregated monetary loss suffered by victims, including individuals, associations, institutions, or corporations, as a result of the real estate fraud cases filed, and those under active investigation by that law enforcement agency.
(4) Each law enforcement agency that, pursuant to this section, has been awarded funds in the previous year, upon reapplication for funds to the committee in each successive year, in addition to any information the committee may require in paragraph (3), shall be required to submit a detailed accounting of funds received and expended in the prior year. The accounting shall include (A) the amount of funds received and expended; (B) the uses to which those 1695.1 of the Civil Code. Case filing decisions continue to be at the discretion of the prosecutor.
(g) A district attorney’s office or a local enforcement agency that has undertaken investigations and prosecutions that will continue into a subsequent program year may receive nonexpended funds from the previous fiscal year subsequent to the annual submission of information detailing the accounting of funds received and expended in the prior year.
(h) No money collected pursuant to this section shall be expended to offset a reduction in any other source of funds. Funds from the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund shall be used only in connection with criminal investigations or prosecutions involving recorded real estate documents.","Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors to adopt, by resolution, a fee of up to $10 for each recording of a real estate instrument, paper, or notice required or permitted by law to be recorded, except as specified. Existing law defines the term “real estate instrument” to exclude a deed, instrument, or writing recorded in connection with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax.
This bill would recast this latter exclusion from a “real estate instrument” as a statement that the above-described fee does not apply to any real estate instrument, paper, or notice accompanied by a declaration stating that the transfer is subject to a documentary transfer tax, is recorded concurrently with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax, or is presented for recording within the same business day as, and is related to the recording of, a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax.","An act to amend Section 27388 of the Government Code, relating to local government."

SECTION 1.
Section 14186.36 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
14186.36.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that a universal assessment process for LTSS be developed and tested. The initial uses of this tool may inform future decisions about whether to amend existing law regarding the assessment processes that currently apply to LTSS programs, including IHSS.
(b) (1) In addition to the activities set forth in paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 14186.35, county agencies shall continue IHSS assessment and authorization processes, including making final determinations of IHSS hours pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 12300) of Chapter 3 and regulations promulgated by the State Department of Social Services.
(2) No sooner than January 1, 2015, for the counties and beneficiary categories specified in subdivision (e), counties shall also utilize the universal assessment tool, as described in subdivision (c), if one is available and upon completion of the stakeholder process, system design and testing, and county training described in subdivisions (c) and (e), for the provision of IHSS services. This paragraph shall only apply to beneficiaries who consent to the use of the universal assessment process. The managed care health plans shall be required to cover IHSS services based on the results of the universal assessment process specified in this section.
(c) (1) No later than June 1, 2013, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall establish a stakeholder workgroup to develop the universal assessment process, including a universal assessment tool, for home- and community-based services, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 14186.1. The stakeholder workgroup shall include, but not be limited to, consumers of IHSS and other home- and community-based services and their authorized representatives, managed care health plans, counties, IHSS, MSSP, and CBAS providers, area agencies on aging, independent living centers, and legislative staff. The universal assessment process shall be used for all home- and community-based services, including IHSS. In developing the process, the workgroup shall build upon the IHSS uniform assessment process and hourly task guidelines, the MSSP assessment process, and other appropriate home- and community-based assessment tools.
(2) (A) In developing the universal assessment process, the departments described in paragraph (1) shall develop a universal assessment tool that will inform the universal assessment process and facilitate the development of plans of care based on the individual needs of the consumer. The workgroup shall consider issues including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) The roles and responsibilities of the health plans, counties, and home- and community-based services providers administering the assessment.
(ii) The criteria for reassessment.
(iii) How the results of new assessments would be used for the oversight and quality monitoring of home- and community-based services providers.
(iv) How the appeals process would be affected by the assessment.
(v) The ability to automate and exchange data and information between home- and community-based services providers.
(vi) How the universal assessment process would incorporate person-centered principles and protections.
(vii) How the universal assessment process would meet the legislative intent of this article and the goals of the demonstration project pursuant to Section 14132.275.
(viii) The qualifications for, and how to provide guidance to, the individuals conducting the assessments.
(B) The workgroup shall also consider how this assessment may be used to assess the need for nursing facility care and divert individuals from nursing facility care to home- and community-based services.
(d) No later than December 1, 2016, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress in developing the universal assessment process, and shall identify the counties and beneficiary categories for which the universal assessment process may be implemented pursuant to subdivision (e).
(e) (1) No sooner than January 1, 2015, upon completion of the design and development of a new universal assessment tool, managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers may test the use of the tool for a specific and limited number of beneficiaries who receive or are potentially eligible to receive home- and community-based services pursuant to this article in no fewer than two, and no more than four, of the counties where the provisions of this article are implemented, if the following conditions have been met:
(A) The department has obtained any federal approvals through necessary federal waivers or amendments, or state plan amendments, whichever occurs later.
(B) The system used to calculate the results of the tool has been tested.
(C) Any entity responsible for using the tool has been trained in its usage.

(3) The department shall develop materials to inform consumers of the option to participate in the universal assessment tool testing phase pursuant to this paragraph.
(f) The department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall implement a rapid-cycle quality improvement system to monitor the implementation of the universal assessment process, identify significant changes in assessment results, and make modifications to the universal assessment process to more closely meet the legislative intent of this article and the goals of the demonstration project pursuant to Section 14132.275.
(g) Until existing law relating to the IHSS assessment process pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 12300) of Chapter 3 is amended, beneficiaries shall have the option to request an additional assessment using the previous assessment process for those home- and community-based services and to receive services according to the results of the additional assessment.
(h) (1) No later than 15 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging, in consultation with stakeholders, shall report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process, and may identify proposed additional beneficiary categories or counties for expanded use of this process and any necessary changes to provide statutory authority for the continued use of the universal assessment process. These departments shall report annually thereafter to the Legislature on the status and results of the universal assessment process. At a minimum, the report shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(A) Findings from consumers assessed using the universal assessment tool regarding their satisfaction with both the universal assessment process and the assessor.
(B) Analysis of the consumers’ ability to follow and accurately respond to all assessment items.
(C) Data collected from the universal assessment process that is compared to previous assessment tool data and this information shall be reported to distinguish the impact of the universal assessment process through the new data collection process.
(2) A report submitted pursuant to this subdivision shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
(i) This section shall remain operative only until September 1, 2018.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including, among other services, home- and community-based services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions.
Existing law, until July 1, 2017, requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to establish a stakeholder workgroup, as prescribed, to develop a universal assessment process, including a universal assessment tool, to be used for home- and community-based services. No later than March 1, 2014, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress in developing the universal assessment process and to identify the counties and beneficiary categories for which the universal assessment process may be implemented. No sooner than January 1, 2015, upon completion of the design and development of that universal assessment tool, existing law authorizes managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers to test the use of the tool for certain beneficiaries in no fewer than 2, and no more than 4, specified counties if certain conditions have been met. No later than 9 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging, to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until September 1, 2018. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress no later than December 1, 2016. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process no later than 15 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process.

589,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 200 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:
200.
(a) There is hereby delegated to the commission the power to regulate the taking or possession of birds, mammals, fish, amphibia, and reptiles for purposes that include, but are not limited to, public health and safety, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in this article.
(b) No power is delegated to the commission by this article to regulate the taking, possessing, processing, or use of fish, amphibia, kelp, or other aquatic plants for commercial purposes, and no provision of this code relating or applying thereto, nor any regulation of the commission made pursuant to these provisions, shall be affected by this article or any regulation made under this article.
SEC. 2.
Section 200.5 is added to the Fish and Game Code, to read:
200.5.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The California Supreme Court In re Makings (1927) 200 Cal. 474, determined that Section 25
1/2
of Article IV of the California Constitution, as currently set forth in Section 20 of Article IV, prohibits local governmental entities from regulating, or interfering with, fish and game matters in any manner and places this responsibility with the Legislature in order to conserve California’s fish and wildlife and permit the greatest use of fish and game resources compatible with the reasonable protection thereof.
(2) The commission was established in 1870 to assist in the scientific, evidence-based management of California’s fish and wildlife resources. The California Constitution permits the Legislature to delegate to the commission certain powers relating to the management of fish and game, and the Legislature has delegated to the commission regulatory powers over the taking and possession of fish and game, as set forth in this code.
(3) Hunting and fishing are statistically among the safest outdoor recreational activities, and are already well regulated by the state through means that include, but are not limited to, mandatory safety and education requirements, discharge laws for firearms used to take wildlife, and regulations adopted by the commission. Additional local regulation would be unnecessary, would impede the proper administration of state fish and game laws, and would create significant enforcement issues. Hunting and fishing activities are also compatible with other recreational uses on many public lands and waters throughout the state.
(b) In enacting this section and Section 200.6, it is the intent of the Legislature to affirm, subject to applicable federal law, the exclusive legal authority granted to the commission and the department with regard to the taking and possession of fish and game and thereby ensure necessary statewide control by the commission and the department over fish and game matters for wildlife conservation purposes, the protection of, and access to, hunting and fishing opportunities for the public, and for public health and safety purposes.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature to expressly preempt local ordinances regarding the taking or possession of fish and game, as provided in Section 200.6.
(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that local governments pursue requests for regulation of hunting, fishing, and depredation permits pursuant to Section 207.
SEC. 3.
Section 200.6 is added to the Fish and Game Code, to read:
200.6.
(a) The state fully occupies the field of the taking and possession of fish and game pursuant to this code, regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to this code, and Section 20 of Article IV of the California Constitution, and all local ordinances and regulations regarding the taking and possession of fish and game are subject to this section.
(b) The commission, the department, or any other governmental entity legally authorized to affect hunting and fishing on navigable waters held in public trust shall ensure that the recreation rights of the public guaranteed under Section 25 of Article I and Section 4 of Article X of the California Constitution are protected in a manner consistent with those provisions.
(c) (1) Unless expressly authorized by this code, other state law, or federal law, the commission and the department are the only entities in the state that may adopt or promulgate regulations regarding the taking or possession of fish and game on any lands or waters within the state.
(2) Nothing in this section prohibits a public or private landowner, or the landowner’s designee, from controlling access or use, including hunting or fishing, on property that the landowner owns in fee, leases, holds an easement upon, or is otherwise expressly authorized to control for those purposes in a manner consistent with state law. However, nothing in this section abridges the public’s rights of navigation, fishing, hunting, or other recreation on waters of the state (see Bohn v. Albertson (1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 738; People ex rel. Baker v. Mack (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 1040; and 68 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 268 (1985)).
(3) This section applies only to activities for which a hunting or fishing license or a depredation permit is required by this code or regulations adopted by the commission, and to activities carried out by an employee or agent of the department as part of his or her official duties. Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or affect existing legal protections for fish and game-related management, recreation, or other activities not specifically mentioned in this section.

Section 203.1 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) The California Constitution provides for the delegation to the Fish and Game Commission of powers relating to the protection and propagation of fish and game. Existing statutory law delegates to the commission the power to regulate the taking or possession of birds, mammals, fish, amphibia, and reptiles in accordance with prescribed laws. Under existing law, the Department of Fish and Wildlife exercises various functions with regard to the taking of fish and game. Under existing law, a city or county has no authority to regulate fish and game except that a city or county may adopt an ordinance that incidentally affects fishing and hunting for the protection of public health and safety.
This bill would provide that the state fully occupies the field of the taking and possession of fish and game. The bill would provide that unless otherwise authorized by the Fish and Game Code, other state law, or federal law, the commission and the department are the only entities that may adopt or promulgate regulations regarding the taking or possession of fish and game on any lands or waters within the state.
(2) Existing law requires the commission, when adopting certain regulations relating to the taking or possession of resident game birds, game mammals, and fur-bearing mammals, to consider populations, habitat, food supplies, the welfare of individual animals, and other pertinent facts and testimony.
This bill would require the commission to consider these factors when adopting certain regulations relating to the taking or possession of fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The bill would also require the commission to consider public health and safety when adopting these regulations.
(3)Existing law generally makes any violation of the Fish and Game Code or any rule, regulation, or order made or adopted under the code a misdemeanor, and specifies that a violation of designated statutes or regulations is either an infraction or a misdemeanor.
This bill would make a violation of a specified statute relating to the intentional discharge of a firearm or release of an arrow or crossbow bolt over or across a public road or other established way open to the public in an unsafe and reckless manner an infraction or a misdemeanor.
(3) Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to intentionally discharge a firearm or release an arrow or crossbow bolt over or across a public road or other established way open to the public in an unsafe and reckless manner. Existing law makes a violation of this provision a misdemeanor.
This bill would delete the “reckless” element from that provision. Because the bill would expand the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 200, 203.1, and

786.
(a) If a minor satisfactorily completes (1) an informal program of supervision pursuant to Section 654.2, (2) probation under Section 725, or (3) a term of probation for any offense, the court shall order the petition dismissed. The court shall order sealed all records pertaining to that dismissed petition in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice. The court shall send a copy of the order to each agency and official named in the order, direct the agency or official to seal its records, and specify a date by which the sealed records shall be destroyed. Each agency and official named in the order shall seal the records in its custody as directed by the order, shall advise the court of its compliance, and, after advising the court, shall seal the copy of the court’s order that was received. The court shall also provide notice to the minor and minor’s counsel that it has ordered the petition dismissed and the records sealed in the case. The notice shall include an advisement of the minor’s right to nondisclosure of the arrest and proceedings, as specified in subdivision (b).
(b) Upon the court’s order of dismissal of the petition, the arrest and other proceedings in the case shall be deemed not to have occurred and the person who was the subject of the petition may reply accordingly to any inquiry by employers, educational institutions, or other persons or entities regarding the arrest and proceedings in the case.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section, satisfactory completion of an informal program of supervision or another term of probation described in subdivision (a) shall be deemed to have occurred if the person has no new findings of wardship or conviction for a felony offense or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude during the period of supervision or probation and if he or she has not failed to substantially comply with the reasonable orders of supervision or probation that are within his or her capacity to perform. The period of supervision or probation shall not be extended solely for the purpose of deferring or delaying eligibility for dismissal of the petition and sealing of the records under this section.
(2) An unfulfilled order or condition of restitution, including a restitution fine that can be converted to a civil judgment under Section 730.6 or an unpaid restitution fee shall not be deemed to constitute unsatisfactory completion of supervision or probation under this section.
(d) A court shall not seal a record or dismiss a petition pursuant to this section if the petition was sustained based on the commission of an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 that was committed when the individual was 14 years of age or older unless the finding on that offense was dismissed or was reduced to a lesser offense that is not listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707.
(e) (1) The court may, in making its order to seal the record and dismiss the instant petition pursuant to this section, include an order to seal a record relating to, or to dismiss, any prior petition or petitions that have been filed or sustained against the individual and that appear to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria otherwise described in this section.
(2) An individual who has a record that is eligible to be sealed under this section may ask the court to order the sealing of a record pertaining to the case that is in the custody of a public agency other than a law enforcement agency, the probation department, or the Department of Justice, and the court may grant the request and order that the public agency record be sealed if the court determines that sealing the additional record will promote the successful reentry and rehabilitation of the individual.
(f) (1) A record that has been ordered sealed by the court under this section may be accessed, inspected, or utilized only under any of the following circumstances:
(A) By the prosecuting attorney, the probation department, or the court for the limited purpose of determining whether the minor is eligible and suitable for deferred entry of judgment pursuant to Section 790 or is ineligible for a program of supervision as defined in Section 654.3.
(B) By the court for the limited purpose of verifying the prior jurisdictional status of a ward who is petitioning the court to resume its jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 388.
(C) If a new petition has been filed against the minor for a felony offense, by the probation department for the limited purpose of identifying the minor’s previous court-ordered programs or placements, and in that event solely to determine the individual’s eligibility or suitability for remedial programs or services. The information obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be disseminated to other agencies or individuals, except as necessary to implement a referral to a remedial program or service, and shall not be used to support the imposition of penalties, detention, or other sanctions upon the minor.
(D) Upon a subsequent adjudication of a minor whose record has been sealed under this section and a finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602 based on the commission of a felony offense, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate juvenile court disposition. Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court’s order dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the prior case.
(E) Upon the prosecuting attorney’s motion, made in accordance with Section 707, to initiate court proceedings to determine the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of evaluating and determining the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court’s order dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the prior case.
(F) By the person whose record has been sealed, upon his or her request and petition to the court to permit inspection of the records.
(2) Access to, or inspection of, a sealed record authorized by paragraph (1) shall not be deemed an unsealing of the record and shall not require notice to any other agency.
(g) (1) This section does not prohibit a court from enforcing a civil judgment for an unfulfilled order of restitution ordered pursuant to Section 730.6. A minor is not relieved from the obligation to pay victim restitution, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees because the minor’s records are sealed.
(2) A victim or a local collection program may continue to enforce victim restitution orders, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees after a record is sealed. The juvenile court shall have access to any records sealed pursuant to this section for the limited purpose of enforcing a civil judgment or restitution order.
(h) The Judicial Council shall adopt rules of court, and shall make available appropriate forms, providing for the standardized implementation of this section by the juvenile courts.

(a) If a minor satisfactorily completes (1) an informal program of supervision pursuant to Section 654.2, (2) probation under Section 725, or (3) a term of probation for any offense, the court shall order the petition dismissed. The court shall order sealed all records pertaining to that dismissed petition in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice. The court shall send a copy of the order to each agency and official named in the order, direct the agency or official to seal its records, and specify a date by which the sealed records shall be destroyed. Each agency and official named in the order shall seal the records in its custody as directed by the order, shall advise the court of its compliance, and, after advising the court, shall seal the copy of the court’s order that was received. The court shall also provide notice to the minor and minor’s counsel that it has ordered the petition dismissed and the records sealed in the case. The notice shall include an advisement of the minor’s right to nondisclosure of the arrest and proceedings, as specified in subdivision (b).
(b) Upon the court’s order of dismissal of the petition, the arrest and other proceedings in the case shall be deemed not to have occurred and the person who was the subject of the petition may reply accordingly to any inquiry by employers, educational institutions, or other persons or entities regarding the arrest and proceedings in the case.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section, satisfactory completion of an informal program of supervision or another term of probation described in subdivision (a) shall be deemed to have occurred if the person has no new findings of wardship or conviction for a felony offense or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude during the period of supervision or probation and if he or she has not failed to substantially comply with the reasonable orders of supervision or probation that are within his or her capacity to perform. The period of supervision or probation shall not be extended solely for the purpose of deferring or delaying eligibility for dismissal of the petition and sealing of the records under this section.
(2) An unfulfilled order or condition of restitution, including a restitution fine that can be converted to a civil judgment under Section 730.6 or an unpaid restitution fee shall not be deemed to constitute unsatisfactory completion of supervision or probation under this section.
(d) A court shall not seal a record or dismiss a petition pursuant to this section if the petition was sustained based on the commission of an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 that was committed when the individual was 14 years of age or older unless the finding on that offense was dismissed or was reduced to a lesser offense that is not listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707.
(e) (1) The court may, in making its order to seal the record and dismiss the instant petition pursuant to this section, include an order to seal a record relating to, or to dismiss, any prior petition or petitions that have been filed or sustained against the individual and that appear to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria otherwise described in this section.
(2) An individual who has a record that is eligible to be sealed under this section may ask the court to order the sealing of a record pertaining to the case that is in the custody of a public agency other than a law enforcement agency, the probation department, or the Department of Justice, and the court may grant the request and order that the public agency record be sealed if the court determines that sealing the additional record will promote the successful reentry and rehabilitation of the individual.
(f) (1) A record that has been ordered sealed by the court under this section may be accessed, inspected, or utilized only under any of the following circumstances:
(A) By the prosecuting attorney, the probation department, or the court for the limited purpose of determining whether the minor is eligible and suitable for deferred entry of judgment pursuant to Section 790 or is ineligible for a program of supervision as defined in Section 654.3.
(B) By the court for the limited purpose of verifying the prior jurisdictional status of a ward who is petitioning the court to resume its jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 388.
(C) If a new petition has been filed against the minor for a felony offense, by the probation department for the limited purpose of identifying the minor’s previous court-ordered programs or placements, and in that event solely to determine the individual’s eligibility or suitability for remedial programs or services. The information obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be disseminated to other agencies or individuals, except as necessary to implement a referral to a remedial program or service, and shall not be used to support the imposition of penalties, detention, or other sanctions upon the minor.
(D) Upon a subsequent adjudication of a minor whose record has been sealed under this section and a finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602 based on the commission of a felony offense, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate juvenile court disposition. Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court’s order dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the prior case.
(E) Upon the prosecuting attorney’s motion, made in accordance with Section 707, to initiate court proceedings to determine the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, by the probation department, the prosecuting attorney, counsel for the minor, or the court for the limited purpose of evaluating and determining the minor’s fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court’s order dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the prior case.
(F) By the person whose record has been sealed, upon his or her request and petition to the court to permit inspection of the records.
(G) The probation department of any county may access the records for the limited purpose of meeting federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E compliance.
(2) Access to, or inspection of, a sealed record authorized by paragraph (1) shall not be deemed an unsealing of the record and shall not require notice to any other agency.
(g) (1) This section does not prohibit a court from enforcing a civil judgment for an unfulfilled order of restitution ordered pursuant to Section 730.6. A minor is not relieved from the obligation to pay victim restitution, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees because the minor’s records are sealed.
(2) A victim or a local collection program may continue to enforce victim restitution orders, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees after a record is sealed. The juvenile court shall have access to any records sealed pursuant to this section for the limited purpose of enforcing a civil judgment or restitution order.
(h) This section does not prohibit the Department of Social Services from meeting its obligations to monitor and conduct periodic evaluations of, and provide reports on, the programs carried under federal Title IV-B and Title IV-E as required by Sections 622, 629 et seq., and 671(a)(7) and (22) of Title 42 of the United States Code, as implemented by federal regulation and state statute.
(i) The Judicial Council shall adopt rules of court, and shall make available appropriate forms, providing for the standardized implementation of this section by the juvenile courts.
SEC. 2.
Section 787 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, immediately following Section 786, to read:
787.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a record sealed pursuant to Section 781 or 786 may be accessed by a law enforcement agency, probation department, court, the Department of Justice, or other state or local agency that has custody of the sealed record for the limited purpose of complying with data collection or data reporting requirements that are imposed by other provisions of law. However, no personally identifying information from a sealed record accessed under this subdivision may be released, disseminated, or published by or through an agency, department, court, or individual that has accessed or obtained information from the sealed record.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a court may authorize a researcher or research organization to access information contained in records that have been sealed pursuant to Section 781 or 786 for the purpose of conducting research on juvenile justice populations, practices, policies, or trends, if both of the following are true:
(1) The court is satisfied that the research project or study includes a methodology for the appropriate protection of the confidentiality of an individual whose sealed record is accessed pursuant to this subdivision.
(2) Personally identifying information relating to the individual whose sealed record is accessed pursuant to this subdivision is not further released, disseminated, or published by or through the researcher or research organization.
(c) For the purposes of this section “personally identifying information” has the same meaning as in Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the privacy of children who have had their juvenile delinquency court records sealed, it is necessary that related records in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, the Department of Justice, or any other public agency also be, or be subject to being, sealed.
SEC. 4.
Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 989. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, (2) each bill amends Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 989, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 5.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law subjects a person under 18 years of age who commits a crime to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge that person to be a ward of the court, except as specified. Under existing law, juvenile court proceedings to declare a minor a ward of the court are commenced by the filing of a petition by the probation officer, the district attorney after consultation with the probation officer, or the prosecuting attorney, as specified. Existing law requires the juvenile court to order the petition of a minor who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court dismissed if the minor satisfactorily completes a term of probation or an informal program of supervision, as specified, and requires the court to seal all records in the custody of the juvenile court pertaining to that dismissed petition, except as specified.
This bill would provide that these provisions do not apply if the petition was sustained based on the commission of certain offenses committed when the individual was 14 years of age or older. The bill would require records pertaining to those cases in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice to be sealed according to a certain procedure. The bill would authorize an individual who has a record that is eligible to be sealed to ask the court to order the sealing of a record pertaining to the case that is in the custody of a public agency other than a law enforcement agency, the probation department, or the Department of Justice. The bill would make records sealed pursuant to this provision available for access or inspection only under specified circumstances. The bill would make related changes. The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt rules of court, and make available appropriate forms, providing for the standardized implementation of these provisions by the juvenile courts. By imposing new duties on local agencies relating to sealing juvenile records, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes a person who is the subject of a juvenile court record, or the county probation officer, to petition the court for the sealing of the records relating to the person’s case, including records in the custody of the juvenile court, the probation officer, or any other agencies, including law enforcement agencies and public officials as the petitioner alleges to have custody of the records. Existing law provides that records sealed pursuant to this provision are not open to inspection, except as specified.
This bill would additionally make those records open to inspection to comply with data collection or data reporting requirements imposed by other provisions of law and would authorize a court to give a researcher or research organization access to information contained in those records, as specified.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
This bill would incorporate changes to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 989, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 786 of, and to add Section 787 to, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to juveniles."

The finder, upon written request of the commissioner, shall furnish to the commissioner any records required to be maintained and preserved under this subdivision.

For the purpose of rules and forms, the commissioner may classify securities, persons, and matters within his or her jurisdiction, and may prescribe different requirements for different classes.","Under existing law, the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, the Commissioner of Business Oversight regulates the activities of a broker-dealer which is defined as, among other things, any person engaged in the business of effecting securities transactions in California for the account of others or his or her own account, and it specifies those persons or entities excluded from the definition. Existing law requires, among other things, that a broker-dealer apply for and secure a certificate authorizing that person to act in that capacity, unless the person is exempted from this requirement, as prescribed. Existing law prohibits a person acting on behalf of a licensed broker-dealer or an issuer, from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless the broker-dealer and agent have complied with certain rules.
This bill would exempt from those provisions an individual who is a finder, as defined, who satisfies specified requirements, including, among other things, filing an initial statement of information with the Commissioner of Business Oversight and paying a filing fee.","An act to add Section 25206.1 to the Corporations Code, relating to securities."

SECTION 1.
Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
402.1.
(a) In the assessment of land, the assessor shall consider the effect upon value of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected. These restrictions shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:
(1) Zoning.
(2) Recorded contracts with governmental agencies other than those provided in Sections 422, 422.5, and 422.7.
(3) Permit authority of, and permits issued by, governmental agencies exercising land use powers concurrently with local governments, including the California Coastal Commission and regional coastal commissions, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.
(4) Development controls of a local government in accordance with any local coastal program certified pursuant to Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code.
(5) Development controls of a local government in accordance with a local protection program, or any component thereof, certified pursuant to Division 19 (commencing with Section 29000) of the Public Resources Code.

(7) Hazardous waste land use restriction pursuant to Section 25240 of the Health and Safety Code.

(9) A solar-use easement pursuant to Chapter 6.9 (commencing with Section 51190) of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 5 of the Government Code.
(10) A contract where the following apply:
(A) The contract is with a nonprofit corporation organized pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that has received a welfare exemption under Section 214.15 for properties intended to be sold to low-income families who participate in a special no-interest loan program.
(B) The contract restricts the use of the land for at least 30 years to owner-occupied housing available at affordable housing cost in accordance with Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
(C) The contract includes a deed of trust on the property in favor of the nonprofit corporation to ensure compliance with the terms of the program, which has no value unless the owner fails to comply with the covenants and restrictions of the terms of the home sale.
(D) The local housing authority or an equivalent agency, or, if none exists, the city attorney or county counsel, has made a finding that the long-term deed restrictions in the contract serve a public purpose.
(E) The contract is recorded and provided to the assessor.
(b) There is a rebuttable presumption that restrictions will not be removed or substantially modified in the predictable future and that they will substantially equate the value of the land to the value attributable to the legally permissible use or uses.
(c) Grounds for rebutting the presumption may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the past history of like use restrictions in the jurisdiction in question and the similarity of sales prices for restricted and unrestricted land. The possible expiration of a restriction at a time certain shall not be conclusive evidence of the future removal or modification of the restriction unless there is no opportunity or likelihood of the continuation or renewal of the restriction, or unless a necessary party to the restriction has indicated an intent to permit its expiration at that time.
(d) In assessing land with respect to which the presumption is unrebutted, the assessor shall not consider sales of otherwise comparable land not similarly restricted as to use as indicative of value of land under restriction, unless the restrictions have a demonstrably minimal effect upon value.
(e) In assessing land under an enforceable use restriction wherein the presumption of no predictable removal or substantial modification of the restriction has been rebutted, but where the restriction nevertheless retains some future life and has some effect on present value, the assessor may consider, in addition to all other legally permissible information, representative sales of comparable lands that are not under restriction but upon which natural limitations have substantially the same effect as restrictions.
(f) For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1) “Comparable lands” are lands that are similar to the land being valued in respect to legally permissible uses and physical attributes.

It is also hereby declared that the further purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting this section and Section 1630 is to avoid an assessment policy which, in the absence of special circumstances, considers uses for land that legally are not available to the owner and not contemplated by government, and that these sections are necessary to implement the public policy of encouraging and maintaining effective land use planning.

Under existing law these restrictions include, but are not limited to, zoning, recorded contracts with governmental agencies, and various other restrictions imposed by governments.
Existing property tax law establishes a welfare exemption under which property is exempt from taxation if, among other things, that property is used exclusively for religious, hospital, scientific, or charitable purposes and is owned and operated by an entity, as provided, that is itself organized and operated for those purposes. Under existing property tax law, the welfare exemption applies to property that is owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, otherwise qualifying for the welfare exemption, that is organized and operated for the purpose of building and rehabilitating single-family or multifamily residences for sale, as provided, at cost to low-income families.
This bill would require the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, a recorded contract with a nonprofit corporation that meets prescribed requirements, including requirements that the nonprofit corporation has received a welfare exemption for properties intended to be sold to low-income families who participate in a special no-interest loan program, and that the contract includes a restriction on the use of the land for at least 30 years to owner-occupied housing available at affordable housing cost. By changing the manner in which county assessors assess property for property taxation purposes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate amendments to Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by AB 1251, to be operative only if AB 1251 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 11549.3 of the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
The state has a very strong interest in protecting its information technology systems from intrusion, because those systems contain confidential information and play a critical role in the performance of the duties of state government. Thus, information regarding the specific vulnerabilities of those systems must be protected to preclude use of that information to facilitate attacks on those systems.","(1) Existing law establishes, within the Government Operations Agency, the Department of Technology under the supervision of the Director of Technology, who is also known as the State Chief Information Officer. The department is generally responsible for the approval and oversight of information technology projects by, among other things, consulting with state agencies during initial project planning to ensure that project proposals are based on well-defined programmatic needs.
Existing law establishes, within the department, the Office of Information Security under the supervision of the Chief of the Office of Information Security. Existing law sets forth the authority of the office, including, but not limited to, the authority to conduct, or require to be conducted, an independent security assessment of any state agency, department, or office, the cost of which is to be funded by the state agency, department, or office being assessed.
This bill would additionally require the office, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to require no fewer than 35 independent security assessments of state entities each year and determine basic standards of services to be performed as part of an independent security assessment. The bill would require the state agency, department, or office being assessed to fund the costs of its independent security assessment. The bill would require the office and the Office of Emergency Services to receive the complete results of an independent security assessment. The bill would prohibit, during the process of conducting an independent security assessment, the disclosure of information and records concerning the independent security assessment, except that the information and records would be authorized to be transmitted to state employees and state contractors with specific duties relating to the independent security assessment. The bill would require the disclosure of the results of a completed independent security assessment under state law.
This bill would require the office, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to rank state entities on an information security risk index, as specified. The bill would require the office to report to the Department of Technology and the Office of Emergency Services any state entity found noncompliant with information security requirements. The bill would further require the office to notify the Office of Emergency Services, Department of the California Highway Patrol, and the Department of Justice of any criminal or alleged criminal cyber activity affecting any state entity or critical infrastructure of state government. The bill would authorize the office to conduct or require to be conducted an audit of information security to ensure program compliance, the cost of which to be funded by the state agency, department, or office being audited.
This bill would authorize the Military Department to perform an independent security assessment as described above.
This bill would require state entities, as defined, rather than certain information security officers, to comply with policies and procedures issued by the office. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes.
(2) Existing law requires that a statute that limits the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings to demonstrate the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would limit access to information and records of an ongoing independent security assessment and would make findings to demonstrate the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.","An act to amend Section 11549.3 of the Government Code, relating to technology."

(2) Upon notice of the motion for transfer, the court of the proposed receiving county may provide comments for the record regarding the proposed transfer, following procedures set forth in rules of court developed by the Judicial Council for this purpose, pursuant to subdivision (f). The court and the probation department shall give the matter of investigating those transfers precedence over all actions or proceedings therein, except actions or proceedings to which special precedence is given by law, to the end that all those transfers shall be completed expeditiously.
(3) If victim restitution was ordered as a condition of probation or mandatory supervision, the transferring court shall determine the amount of restitution before the transfer unless the court finds that the determination cannot be made within a reasonable time from when the motion for transfer is made.

A copy of the orders and any probation reports shall be transmitted to the court and probation officer of the receiving county within two weeks of the finding that the person does permanently reside in or has permanently moved to that county, and the receiving court shall have entire jurisdiction over the case, except as provided in subdivisions (d) and (e), with the like power to again request transfer of the case whenever it seems proper.
(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) and except as provided in subdivision (e), if the transferring court has ordered the defendant to pay fines, fees, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution, the transfer order shall require that those and any other amounts ordered by the transferring court that are still unpaid at the time of transfer be paid by the defendant to the collection program for the transferring court for proper distribution and accounting once collected.
(2) The receiving court and receiving county probation department may impose additional local fees and costs as authorized, and shall notify the responsible collection program for the transferring court of those changes.
(3) Any local fees imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be paid by the defendant to the collection program for the transferring court which shall remit the additional fees and costs to the receiving court for proper accounting and distribution.
(e) (1) Upon approval of a transferring court, a receiving court may elect to collect all of the court-ordered payments from a defendant attributable to the case under which the defendant is being supervised, provided, however, that the collection program for the receiving court transmits the revenue collected to the collection program for the transferring court for deposit, accounting, and distribution. A collection program for the receiving court shall not charge administrative fees for collections performed for the collection program for the transferring court without a written agreement with the other program.
(2) A collection program for a receiving court collecting funds for a collection program for a transferring court pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not report revenue owed or collected on behalf of the collection program for the transferring court as part of those collections required to be reported annually by the court to the Judicial Council.
(f) The Judicial Council shall promulgate rules of court for procedures by which the proposed receiving county shall receive notice of the motion for transfer and by which responsive comments may be transmitted to the court of the transferring county. The Judicial Council shall adopt rules providing factors for the court’s consideration when determining the appropriateness of a transfer, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) Permanency of residence of the offender.
(2) Local programs available for the offender.
(3) Restitution orders and victim issues.

This bill would require the receiving court to accept the entire jurisdiction over the case effective the date the transferring court orders the transfer. The bill would provide that when fines, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution have been ordered by the transferring court and have not been fully paid, those payments would be made to the collecting program for the transferring court for distribution and accounting.

In addition the board may file with the assessor a confidential report containing matters relating to personnel. Before preparing its written survey report, the board shall do both of the following:
(1) Meet with the assessor to discuss and confer on those matters which may be included in the written survey report.
(2) Notify the former assessor if the survey reviews the former assessor’s procedures and practices, and meet with the former assessor, upon his or her request, to discuss and confer on those matters that may be included in the survey report.
(b) Within 30 days after receiving a copy of the survey report, the assessor may file with the board a written response to the findings and recommendations in the survey report.
The board may, for good cause, extend the period for filing the response.
(c) (1) The survey report, together with the assessor’s response, if any, and the board’s comments, if any, shall constitute the final survey report. An addendum to the final survey report shall be published to include a former assessor’s written response to the findings and recommendations in the survey report that reviewed the former assessor’s procedures and practices, if any, and the board’s comments, if any.

This bill would eliminate the board’s requirement to select at random at least 3 remaining counties or cities and counties to conduct a sample of assessments on the local assessment roll, and would instead require the board, commencing January 1, 2016, and each of the next 4 calendar years, to survey the assessment procedures of qualified counties or cities and counties and to conduct sample assessments on the local roll of other qualified counties or cities and counties. This bill would define “qualified counties or cities and counties” for these purposes. This bill would additionally require the board to conduct a sample of assessments in a county or city and county that the board determines has significant assessment problems, as specified.

Section 13300.7 of the Elections Code is amended to read:
13300.7.
Notwithstanding any other law, county and city elections officials may establish procedures designed to permit a voter to opt out of receiving his or her sample ballot, voter pamphlet, notice of polling place, and associated materials by mail, and instead obtain them electronically via email or by accessing them on the county’s or city’s Internet Web site, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a) The procedures establish a method of providing notice of and an opportunity by which a voter can notify elections officials of his or her desire to obtain ballot materials electronically in lieu of receiving them by mail.
(b) The voter email address or any other information provided by the voter under this section remains confidential pursuant to Section 6254.4 of the Government Code and Section 2194 of this code.
(c) The procedures provide notice and opportunity for a voter who has opted out of receiving a sample ballot and other materials by mail to opt back into receiving them by mail.
(d) The procedures establish a process by which a voter can apply electronically to become a vote by mail voter.
(e) A voter may only opt out of, or opt back into, receiving his or her sample ballot and other ballot materials by mail if the elections official receives the request and can process it prior to the statutory deadline for the mailing of those materials for the next election, pursuant to Section 13303. If a voter misses this deadline, the request shall take effect the following election.
(f) The procedures shall include a verification process to confirm the voter’s identity, either in writing with a signature card that can be matched to the one on file with the elections official, or if the request is submitted electronically, it shall contain the voter’s California driver’s license number, California identification number, or a partial social security number.
(g) Information made available over the Internet pursuant to this section shall meet or exceed the most current, ratified standards under Section 508 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 794d), as amended, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium for accessibility. Election officials may also implement recommendations of the Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee made pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 2053, and of any local Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee created pursuant to the guidelines promulgated by the Secretary of State related to the accessibility of polling places by the physically handicapped.","Existing law, the Visually Impaired Voter Assistance Act of 1989, requires the Secretary of State to establish a Visually Impaired Voter Assistance Board and prescribes the composition of the board, as specified. Under existing law the board is required to, among other things, make recommendations to the Secretary of State for improving the availability and accessibility of ballot pamphlet audio recordings and their delivery to visually impaired voters. Existing law also requires the Secretary of State to make available the complete state ballot pamphlet over the Internet, which is required to include specified information. Existing law further authorizes county and city elections officials to establish procedures designed to permit a voter to opt out of receiving his or her sample ballot, voter pamphlet, notice of polling place, and associated materials by mail, and instead obtain them electronically via email or by accessing them on the county’s or city’s Internet Web site, as specified.
This bill would rename the board as the Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee and would instead require the committee to advise the Secretary of State on improving the accessibility of elections, including election materials, as specified, for all voters with disabilities, and would revise the composition of the committee, as specified. The bill would require the Secretary of State to consult with the committee and consider the committee’s recommendations, which the Secretary of State could implement at his or her discretion. The bill would also require the committee to make additional recommendations to the Secretary of State for improving the accessibility of election materials made available over the Internet, and would require the elections materials made available over the Internet to meet or exceed certain standards and guidelines, as specified. The bill would further require the committee to make recommendations for providing voters with disabilities the same access and participation as is provided to other voters who are not disabled, including the ability to vote privately and independently.","An act to amend Sections 2053, 9082.7, and 13300.7 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

Pursuant to Section 6103 of the Government Code, no fees shall be charged by the clerk of the superior court for the performance of any official service required in connection with the entry of judgment pursuant to this section.","Existing law establishes a regulatory scheme for the marketing of shell eggs, and requires egg producers and egg handlers to register with the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. A violation of those provisions or regulations adopted pursuant to those provisions is unlawful, and for certain violations, punishable as a misdemeanor. Existing law also authorizes the secretary, in lieu of seeking prosecution for the violation, to bring a civil action for up to $1,000 for the violation.

598,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 14132.100 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
14132.100.
(a) The federally qualified health center services described in Section 1396d(a)(2)(C) of Title 42 of the United States Code are covered benefits.
(b) The rural health clinic services described in Section 1396d(a)(2)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code are covered benefits.
(c) Federally qualified health center services and rural health clinic services shall be reimbursed on a per-visit basis in accordance with the definition of “visit” set forth in subdivision (g).
(d) Effective October 1, 2004, and on each October 1, thereafter, until no longer required by federal law, federally qualified health center (FQHC) and rural health clinic (RHC) per-visit rates shall be increased by the Medicare Economic Index applicable to primary care services in the manner provided for in Section 1396a(bb)(3)(A) of Title 42 of the United States Code. Prior to January 1, 2004, FQHC and RHC per-visit rates shall be adjusted by the Medicare Economic Index in accordance with the methodology set forth in the state plan in effect on October 1, 2001.
(e) (1) An FQHC or RHC may apply for an adjustment to its per-visit rate based on a change in the scope of services provided by the FQHC or RHC. Rate changes based on a change in the scope of services provided by an FQHC or RHC shall be evaluated in accordance with Medicare reasonable cost principles, as set forth in Part 413 (commencing with Section 413.1) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or its successor.
(2) Subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of paragraph (3), a change in scope of service means any of the following:
(A) The addition of a new FQHC or RHC service that is not incorporated in the baseline prospective payment system (PPS) rate, or a deletion of an FQHC or RHC service that is incorporated in the baseline PPS rate.
(B) A change in service due to amended regulatory requirements or rules.
(C) A change in service resulting from relocating or remodeling an FQHC or RHC.
(D) A change in types of services due to a change in applicable technology and medical practice utilized by the center or clinic.
(E) An increase in service intensity attributable to changes in the types of patients served, including, but not limited to, populations with HIV or AIDS, or other chronic diseases, or homeless, elderly, migrant, or other special populations.
(F) Any changes in any of the services described in subdivision (a) or (b), or in the provider mix of an FQHC or RHC or one of its sites.
(G) Changes in operating costs attributable to capital expenditures associated with a modification of the scope of any of the services described in subdivision (a) or (b), including new or expanded service facilities, regulatory compliance, or changes in technology or medical practices at the center or clinic.
(H) Indirect medical education adjustments and a direct graduate medical education payment that reflects the costs of providing teaching services to interns and residents.
(I) Any changes in the scope of a project approved by the federal Health Resources and
Service
Services
Administration (HRSA).
(3) No change in costs shall, in and of itself, be considered a scope-of-service change unless all of the following apply:
(A) The increase or decrease in cost is attributable to an increase or decrease in the scope of services defined in subdivisions (a) and (b), as applicable.
(B) The cost is allowable under Medicare reasonable cost principles set forth in Part 413 (commencing with Section 413) of Subchapter B of Chapter 4 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or its successor.
(C) The change in the scope of services is a change in the type, intensity, duration, or amount of services, or any combination thereof.
(D) The net change in the FQHC’s or RHC’s rate equals or exceeds 1.75 percent for the affected FQHC or RHC site. For FQHCs and RHCs that filed consolidated cost reports for multiple sites to establish the initial prospective payment reimbursement rate, the 1.75-percent threshold shall be applied to the average per-visit rate of all sites for the purposes of calculating the cost associated with a scope-of-service change. “Net change” means the per-visit rate change attributable to the cumulative effect of all increases and decreases for a particular fiscal year.
(4) An FQHC or RHC may submit requests for scope-of-service changes once per fiscal year, only within 90 days following the beginning of the FQHC’s or RHC’s fiscal year. Any approved increase or decrease in the provider’s rate shall be retroactive to the beginning of the FQHC’s or RHC’s fiscal year in which the request is submitted.
(5) An FQHC or RHC shall submit a scope-of-service rate change request within 90 days of the beginning of any FQHC or RHC fiscal year occurring after the effective date of this section, if, during the FQHC’s or RHC’s prior fiscal year, the FQHC or RHC experienced a decrease in the scope of services provided that the FQHC or RHC either knew or should have known would have resulted in a significantly lower per-visit rate. If an FQHC or RHC discontinues providing onsite pharmacy or dental services, it shall submit a scope-of-service rate change request within 90 days of the beginning of the following fiscal year. The rate change shall be effective as provided for in paragraph (4). As used in this paragraph, “significantly lower” means an average per-visit rate decrease in excess of 2.5 percent.
(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), if the approved scope-of-service change or changes were initially implemented on or after the first day of an FQHC’s or RHC’s fiscal year ending in calendar year 2001, but before the adoption and issuance of written instructions for applying for a scope-of-service change, the adjusted reimbursement rate for that scope-of-service change shall be made retroactive to the date the scope-of-service change was initially implemented. Scope-of-service changes under this paragraph shall be required to be submitted within the later of 150 days after the adoption and issuance of the written instructions by the department, or 150 days after the end of the FQHC’s or RHC’s fiscal year ending in 2003.
(7) All references in this subdivision to “fiscal year” shall be construed to be references to the fiscal year of the individual FQHC or RHC, as the case may be.
(f) (1) An FQHC or RHC may request a supplemental payment if extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the FQHC or RHC occur after December 31, 2001, and PPS payments are insufficient due to these extraordinary circumstances. Supplemental payments arising from extraordinary circumstances under this subdivision shall be solely and exclusively within the discretion of the department and shall not be subject to subdivision (l). These supplemental payments shall be determined separately from the scope-of-service adjustments described in subdivision (e). Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, acts of nature, changes in applicable requirements in the Health and Safety Code, changes in applicable licensure requirements, and changes in applicable rules or regulations. Mere inflation of costs alone, absent extraordinary circumstances, shall not be grounds for supplemental payment. If an FQHC’s or RHC’s PPS rate is sufficient to cover its overall costs, including those associated with the extraordinary circumstances, then a supplemental payment is not warranted.
(2) The department shall accept requests for supplemental payment at any time throughout the prospective payment rate year.
(3) Requests for supplemental payments shall be submitted in writing to the department and shall set forth the reasons for the request. Each request shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to enable the department to act upon the request. Documentation shall include the data necessary to demonstrate that the circumstances for which supplemental payment is requested meet the requirements set forth in this section. Documentation shall include all of the following:
(A) A presentation of data to demonstrate reasons for the FQHC’s or RHC’s request for a supplemental payment.
(B) Documentation showing the cost implications. The cost impact shall be material and significant, two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or 1 percent of a facility’s total costs, whichever is less.
(4) A request shall be submitted for each affected year.
(5) Amounts granted for supplemental payment requests shall be paid as lump-sum amounts for those years and not as revised PPS rates, and shall be repaid by the FQHC or RHC to the extent that it is not expended for the specified purposes.
(6) The department shall notify the provider of the department’s discretionary decision in writing.
(g) (1) An FQHC or RHC “visit” means a face-to-face encounter between an FQHC or RHC patient and a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, certified nurse-midwife, clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker,
marriage and family therapist,
or a visiting nurse. For purposes of this section, “physician” shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Medicare Rural Health Clinic and Federally Qualified Health Center Manual (Publication 27), or its successor, only to the extent that it defines the professionals whose services are reimbursable on a per-visit basis and not as to the types of services that these professionals may render during these visits and shall include a physician and surgeon, podiatrist, dentist, optometrist, and chiropractor. A visit shall also include a face-to-face encounter between an FQHC or RHC patient and a comprehensive perinatal services practitioner, as defined in Section 51179.1 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, providing comprehensive perinatal services, a four-hour day of attendance at an adult day health care center, and any other provider identified in the state plan’s definition of an FQHC or RHC visit.
(2) (A) A visit shall also include a face-to-face encounter between an FQHC or RHC patient and a dental hygienist or a dental hygienist in alternative practice.
(B) Notwithstanding subdivision (e), an FQHC or RHC that currently includes the cost of the services of a dental hygienist in alternative practice for the purposes of establishing its FQHC or RHC rate shall apply for an adjustment to its per-visit rate, and, after the rate adjustment has been approved by the department, shall bill these services as a separate visit. However, multiple encounters with dental professionals that take place on the same day shall constitute a single visit. The department shall develop the appropriate forms to determine which FQHC’s or RHC rates shall be adjusted and to facilitate the calculation of the adjusted rates. An FQHC’s or RHC’s application for, or the department’s approval of, a rate adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph shall not constitute a change in scope of service within the meaning of subdivision (e). An FQHC or RHC that applies for an adjustment to its rate pursuant to this subparagraph may continue to bill for all other FQHC or RHC visits at its existing per-visit rate, subject to reconciliation, until the rate adjustment for visits between an FQHC or RHC patient and a dental hygienist or a dental hygienist in alternative practice has been approved. Any approved increase or decrease in the provider’s rate shall be made within six months after the date of receipt of the department’s rate adjustment forms pursuant to this subparagraph and shall be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the FQHC or RHC submits the request, but in no case shall the effective date be earlier than January 1, 2008.
(C) An FQHC or RHC that does not provide dental hygienist or dental hygienist in alternative practice services, and later elects to add these services, shall process the addition of these services as a change in scope of service pursuant to subdivision (e).
(h) If FQHC or RHC services are partially reimbursed by a third-party payer, such as a managed care entity (as defined in Section 1396u-2(a)(1)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code), the Medicare Program, or the Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) program, the department shall reimburse an FQHC or RHC for the difference between its per-visit PPS rate and receipts from other plans or programs on a contract-by-contract basis and not in the aggregate, and may not include managed care financial incentive payments that are required by federal law to be excluded from the calculation.
(i) (1) An entity that first qualifies as an FQHC or RHC in the year 2001 or later, a newly licensed facility at a new location added to an existing FQHC or RHC, and any entity that is an existing FQHC or RHC that is relocated to a new site shall each have its reimbursement rate established in accordance with one of the following methods, as selected by the FQHC or RHC:
(A) The rate may be calculated on a per-visit basis in an amount that is equal to the average of the per-visit rates of three comparable FQHCs or RHCs located in the same or adjacent area with a similar caseload.
(B) In the absence of three comparable FQHCs or RHCs with a similar caseload, the rate may be calculated on a per-visit basis in an amount that is equal to the average of the per-visit rates of three comparable FQHCs or RHCs located in the same or an adjacent service area, or in a reasonably similar geographic area with respect to relevant social, health care, and economic characteristics.
(C) At a new entity’s one-time election, the department shall establish a reimbursement rate, calculated on a per-visit basis, that is equal to 100 percent of the projected allowable costs to the FQHC or RHC of furnishing FQHC or RHC services during the first 12 months of operation as an FQHC or RHC. After the first 12-month period, the projected per-visit rate shall be increased by the Medicare Economic Index then in effect. The projected allowable costs for the first 12 months shall be cost settled and the prospective payment reimbursement rate shall be adjusted based on actual and allowable cost per visit.
(D) The department may adopt any further and additional methods of setting reimbursement rates for newly qualified FQHCs or RHCs as are consistent with Section 1396a(bb)(4) of Title 42 of the United States Code.
(2) In order for an FQHC or RHC to establish the comparability of its caseload for purposes of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), the department shall require that the FQHC or RHC submit its most recent annual utilization report as submitted to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, unless the FQHC or RHC was not required to file an annual utilization report. FQHCs or RHCs that have experienced changes in their services or caseload subsequent to the filing of the annual utilization report may submit to the department a completed report in the format applicable to the prior calendar year. FQHCs or RHCs that have not previously submitted an annual utilization report shall submit to the department a completed report in the format applicable to the prior calendar year. The FQHC or RHC shall not be required to submit the annual utilization report for the comparable FQHCs or RHCs to the department, but shall be required to identify the comparable FQHCs or RHCs.
(3) The rate for any newly qualified entity set forth under this subdivision shall be effective retroactively to the later of the date that the entity was first qualified by the applicable federal agency as an FQHC or RHC, the date a new facility at a new location was added to an existing FQHC or RHC, or the date on which an existing FQHC or RHC was relocated to a new site. The FQHC or RHC shall be permitted to continue billing for Medi-Cal covered benefits on a fee-for-service basis until it is informed of its enrollment as an FQHC or RHC, and the department shall reconcile the difference between the fee-for-service payments and the FQHC’s or RHC’s prospective payment rate at that time.
(j) Visits occurring at an intermittent clinic site, as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 1206 of the Health and Safety Code, of an existing FQHC or RHC, or in a mobile unit as defined by paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 1765.105 of the Health and Safety Code, shall be billed by and reimbursed at the same rate as the FQHC or RHC establishing the intermittent clinic site or the mobile unit, subject to the right of the FQHC or RHC to request a scope-of-service adjustment to the rate.
(k) An FQHC or RHC may elect to have pharmacy or dental services reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, utilizing the current fee schedules established for those services. These costs shall be adjusted out of the FQHC’s or RHC’s clinic base rate as scope-of-service changes. An FQHC or RHC that reverses its election under this subdivision shall revert to its prior rate, subject to an increase to account for all MEI increases occurring during the intervening time period, and subject to any increase or decrease associated with applicable scope-of-services adjustments as provided in subdivision (e).
(l) FQHCs and RHCs may appeal a grievance or complaint concerning ratesetting, scope-of-service changes, and settlement of cost report audits, in the manner prescribed by Section 14171. The rights and remedies provided under this subdivision are cumulative to the rights and remedies available under all other provisions of law of this state.
(m) The department shall, by no later than March 30, 2008, promptly seek all necessary federal approvals in order to implement this section, including any amendments to the state plan. To the extent that any element or requirement of this section is not approved, the department shall submit a request to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for any waivers that would be necessary to implement this section.
(n) The department shall implement this section only to the extent that federal financial participation is obtained.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that federally qualified health center services and rural health clinic services, as defined, are covered benefits under the Medi-Cal program, to be reimbursed, to the extent that federal financial participation is obtained, to providers on a per-visit basis. “Visit” is defined as a face-to-face encounter between a patient of a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic and specified health care professionals.
This bill would include a marriage and family therapist within those health care professionals covered under that definition.","An act to amend Section 14132.100 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal."
