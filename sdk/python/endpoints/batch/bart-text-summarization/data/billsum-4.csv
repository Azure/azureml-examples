Upon receipt of a claim, a public entity and a contractor may, by mutual agreement, extend the time period provided in this subdivision.
(B) The claimant shall furnish reasonable documentation to support the claim.
(C) If the public entity needs approval from its governing body to provide the claimant a written statement identifying the disputed portion and the undisputed portion of the claim, and the governing body does not meet within the 45 days or within the mutually agreed to extension of time following receipt of a claim sent by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, the public entity shall have up to three days following the next duly publicly noticed meeting of the governing body after the 45-day period, or extension, expires to provide the claimant a written statement identifying the disputed portion and the undisputed portion.

Each party shall bear the fees and costs charged by its respective mediator in connection with the selection of the neutral mediator. If mediation is unsuccessful, the parts of the claim remaining in dispute shall be subject to applicable procedures outside this section.
(C) For purposes of this section, mediation includes any nonbinding process, such as neutral evaluation or a dispute review board, in which an independent third party or board assists the parties in dispute resolution through negotiation or by issuance of an evaluation.

(3) Failure by the public entity to respond to a claim from a contractor within the time periods described in this subdivision or to otherwise meet the time requirements of this section shall result in the claim being deemed rejected in its entirety. A claim that is denied by reason of the public entity’s failure to have responded to a claim, or its failure to otherwise meet the time requirements of this section, shall not constitute an adverse finding with regard to the merits of the claim or the responsibility or qualifications of the claimant.
(4) Amounts not paid in a timely manner as required by this section shall bear interest at 7 percent per annum.
(5) If a subcontractor or a lower tier subcontractor lacks legal standing to assert a claim against a public entity because privity of contract does not exist, the contractor may present to the public entity a claim on behalf of a subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor. A subcontractor may request in writing, either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a lower tier subcontractor, that the contractor present a claim for work which was performed by the subcontractor or by a lower tier subcontractor on behalf of the subcontractor. The subcontractor requesting that the claim be presented to the public entity shall furnish reasonable documentation to support the claim. Within 45 days of receipt of this written request, the contractor shall notify the subcontractor in writing as to whether the contractor presented the claim to the public entity and, if the original contractor did not present the claim, provide the subcontractor with a statement of the reasons for not having done so.
(e) The text of this section or a summary of it shall be set forth in the plans or specifications for any public works project that may give rise to a claim under this section.
(f) A waiver of the rights granted by this section is void and contrary to public policy, provided, however, that (1) upon receipt of a claim, the parties may mutually agree to waive, in writing, mediation and proceed directly to the commencement of a civil action or binding arbitration, as applicable; and (2) a public entity in its public works contracts may include dispute resolution provisions that comply with this section, including the timeframes set forth herein, and that prescribe additional reasonable and equitable terms regarding actions or procedures to be taken by the parties.
(g) This section applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2016.
(h) Nothing in this section shall impose liability upon a public entity that makes loans or grants available through a competitive application process, for the failure of an awardee to meet its contractual obligations.
(i) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2019, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law prescribes various requirements regarding the formation, content, and enforcement of state and local public contracts. Existing law applicable to state public contracts generally requires that the resolution of claims related to those contracts be subject to arbitration. Existing law applicable to local agency contracts prescribes a process for the resolution of claims related to those contracts of $375,000 or less.
This bill would establish, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2016, a claim resolution process applicable to all claims by contractors in connection with public works. The bill would define a claim as a separate demand by the contractor for one or more of the following: a time extension for relief from damages or penalties for delay, payment of money or damages arising from work done pursuant to the contract for a public work, or payment of an amount disputed by the public entity, as specified.
The bill would require a public entity, defined to exclude certain state entities, upon receipt of a claim sent by registered or certified mail, to review it and, within 45 days, provide a written statement identifying the disputed and undisputed portions of the claim. The 45-day period may be extended by mutual agreement. The bill would require any payment due on an undisputed portion of the claim to be processed within 60 days, as specified. The bill, if the public entity fails to issue the written statement, would require that the claim be deemed rejected in its entirety. The bill would authorize, if the claimant disputes the public entity’s written response or if the public entity fails to respond to a claim within the time prescribed, the claimant to demand to meet and confer for settlement of the issues in dispute. The bill would require any disputed portion of the claim that remains in dispute after the meet and confer conference to be subject to nonbinding mediation, as specified. The bill would provide that unpaid claim amounts accrue interest at 7% per annum. The bill would prescribe a procedure by which a subcontractor or lower tier contractor may make a claim through the contractor. The bill would require the text of these provisions or a summary of them to be set forth in the plans or specifications for any public work which may give rise to a claim. The bill would specify that a waiver of the rights granted by its provisions is void and contrary to public policy, except as specified. The bill would also specify that it does not impose liability on a public entity that makes loans or grants available through a competitive application process, for the failure of an awardee to meet its contractual obligations. By increasing the duties of local agencies and officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, on January 1, 2019, repeal the provision establishing the claim resolution process.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add and repeal Section 9204 of the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts."
801,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1000 of the Penal Code is amended to read:

(b) The prosecuting attorney shall review his or her file to determine whether or not paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, of subdivision (a) apply to the defendant. If the defendant is found eligible, the prosecuting attorney shall file with the court a declaration in writing or state for the record the grounds upon which the determination is based, and shall make this information available to the defendant and his or her attorney. This procedure is intended to allow the court to set the hearing for pretrial diversion at the arraignment. If the defendant is found ineligible for pretrial diversion, the prosecuting attorney shall file with the court a declaration in writing or state for the record the grounds upon which the determination is based, and shall make this information available to the defendant and his or her attorney. The sole remedy of a defendant who is found ineligible for pretrial diversion is a postconviction appeal.
(c) All referrals for pretrial diversion granted by the court pursuant to this chapter shall be made only to programs that have been certified by the county drug program administrator pursuant to Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 1211) of Title 8, or to programs that provide services at no cost to the participant and have been deemed by the court and the county drug program administrator to be credible and effective.

However, urinalysis results shall not be admissible as a basis for any new criminal prosecution or proceeding.
SEC. 2.
Section 1000.1 of the Penal Code is amended to read:

(4) A clear statement that upon any failure of treatment or condition under the program, or any circumstance specified in Section 1000.3, the prosecuting attorney or the probation department or the court on its own may make a motion to the court to terminate pretrial diversion and schedule further proceedings as otherwise provided in this code.

(b) If the defendant consents and waives his or her right to a speedy trial and a speedy preliminary hearing, if applicable, the court may refer the case to the probation department or the court may summarily grant pretrial diversion. When directed by the court, the probation department shall make an investigation and take into consideration the defendant’s age, employment and service records, educational background, community and family ties, prior controlled substance use, treatment history, if any, demonstrable motivation, and other mitigating factors in determining whether the defendant is a person who would be benefited by education, treatment, or rehabilitation. The probation department shall also determine which programs the defendant would benefit from and which programs would accept the defendant. The probation department shall report its findings and recommendations to the court. The court shall make the final determination regarding education, treatment, or rehabilitation for the defendant. If the court determines that it is appropriate, the court shall grant pretrial diversion if the defendant pleads not guilty to the charge or charges and waives the right to a speedy trial and to a speedy preliminary hearing, if applicable.
(c) (1) No statement, or any information procured therefrom, made by the defendant to any probation officer or drug treatment worker, that is made during the course of any investigation conducted by the probation department or treatment program pursuant to subdivision (b), and prior to the reporting of the probation department’s findings and recommendations to the court, shall be admissible in any action or proceeding brought subsequent to the investigation.
(2) No statement, or any information procured therefrom, with respect to the specific offense with which the defendant is charged, that is made to any probation officer or drug program worker subsequent to the granting of pretrial diversion shall be admissible in any action or proceeding.
(d) A defendant’s participation in pretrial diversion pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a conviction or an admission of guilt for any purpose.
SEC. 3.
Section 1000.2 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1000.2.
(a) The court shall hold a hearing and, after consideration of any information relevant to its decision, shall determine if the defendant consents to further proceedings under this chapter and if the defendant should be granted pretrial diversion. If the defendant does not consent to participate in pretrial diversion the proceedings shall continue as in any other case.
(b) At the time that pretrial diversion is granted, any bail bond or undertaking, or deposit in lieu thereof, on file by or on behalf of the defendant shall be exonerated, and the court shall enter an order so directing.

Progress reports shall be filed by the probation department with the court as directed by the court.
SEC. 4.
Section 1000.3 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1000.3.
(a) If it appears to the prosecuting attorney, the court, or the probation department that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the assigned program, or that the defendant is convicted of an offense that reflects the defendant’s propensity for violence, or the defendant is convicted of a felony, the prosecuting attorney, the court on its own, or the probation department may make a motion for termination from pretrial diversion.
(b) After notice to the defendant, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether pretrial diversion shall be terminated.
(c) If the court finds that the defendant is not performing satisfactorily in the assigned program, or the court finds that the defendant has been convicted of a crime as indicated in subdivision (a) the court shall schedule the matter for further proceedings as otherwise provided in this code.
(d) If the defendant has completed pretrial diversion, at the end of that period, the criminal charge or charges shall be dismissed.
(e) Prior to dismissing the charge or charges or terminating pretrial diversion, the court shall consider the defendant’s ability to pay and whether the defendant has paid a diversion restitution fee pursuant to Section 1001.90, if ordered, and has met his or her financial obligation to the program, if any. As provided in Section 1203.1b, the defendant shall reimburse the probation department for the reasonable cost of any program investigation or progress report filed with the court as directed pursuant to Sections 1000.1 and 1000.2.
SEC. 5.
Section 1000.4 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1000.4.
(a) Any record filed with the Department of Justice shall indicate the disposition in those cases referred to pretrial diversion pursuant to this chapter. Upon successful completion of a pretrial diversion program, the arrest upon which the defendant was diverted shall be deemed to have never occurred. The defendant may indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or granted pretrial diversion for the offense, except as specified in subdivision (b). A record pertaining to an arrest resulting in successful completion of a pretrial diversion program shall not, without the defendant’s consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.
(b) The defendant shall be advised that, regardless of his or her successful completion of the pretrial diversion program, the arrest upon which pretrial diversion was based may be disclosed by the Department of Justice in response to any peace officer application request and that, notwithstanding subdivision (a), this section does not relieve him or her of the obligation to disclose the arrest in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or application for a position as a peace officer, as defined in Section 830.
SEC. 6.
Section 1000.5 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1000.5.
(a) The presiding judge of the superior court, or a judge designated by the presiding judge, together with the district attorney and the public defender, may agree in writing to establish and conduct a preguilty plea drug court program pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, wherein criminal proceedings are suspended without a plea of guilty for designated defendants. The drug court program shall include a regimen of graduated sanctions and rewards, individual and group therapy, urinalysis testing commensurate with treatment needs, close court monitoring and supervision of progress, educational or vocational counseling as appropriate, and other requirements as agreed to by the presiding judge or his or her designee, the district attorney, and the public defender. If there is no agreement in writing for a preguilty plea program by the presiding judge or his or her designee, the district attorney, and the public defender, the program shall be operated as a pretrial diversion program as provided in this chapter.
(b) The provisions of Section 1000.3 and Section 1000.4 regarding satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance in a program shall apply to preguilty plea programs. If the court finds that (1) the defendant is not performing satisfactorily in the assigned program, (2) the defendant is not benefiting from education, treatment, or rehabilitation, (3) the defendant has been convicted of a crime specified in Section 1000.3, or (4) the defendant has engaged in criminal conduct rendering him or her unsuitable for the preguilty plea program, the court shall reinstate the criminal charge or charges. If the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period of the preguilty plea program, at the end of that period, the criminal charge or charges shall be dismissed and the provisions of Section 1000.4 shall apply.
SEC. 7.
Section 1000.6 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1000.6.
(a) Where a person is participating in a pretrial diversion program or a preguilty plea program pursuant to this chapter, the person shall be allowed, under the direction of a licensed health care practitioner, to use medications including, but not limited to, methadone, buprenorphine, or levoalphacetylmethadol (LAAM) to treat substance use disorders if the participant allows release of his or her medical records to the court presiding over the participant’s preguilty plea or pretrial diversion program for the limited purpose of determining whether or not the participant is using such medications under the direction of a licensed health care practitioner and is in compliance with the pretrial diversion or preguilty plea program rules.
(b) If the conditions specified in subdivision (a) are met, using medications to treat substance use disorders shall not be the sole reason for exclusion from a pretrial diversion or preguilty plea program. A patient who uses medications to treat substance use disorders and participates in a preguilty plea or pretrial diversion program shall comply with all court program rules.
(c) A person who is participating in a pretrial diversion program or preguilty plea program pursuant to this chapter who uses medications to treat substance use disorders shall present to the court a declaration from his or her health care practitioner, or his or her health care practitioner’s authorized representative, that the person is currently under their care.
(d) Urinalysis results that only establish that a person described in this section has ingested medication duly prescribed to that person by his or her physician or psychiatrist, or medications used to treat substance use disorders, shall not be considered a violation of the terms of the pretrial diversion or preguilty plea program under this chapter.
(e) Except as provided in subdivisions (a) to (d), inclusive, this section shall not be interpreted to amend any provisions governing diversion programs.
SEC. 8.
Section 1000.7 is added to the Penal Code, immediately following Section 1000.6, to read:
1000.7.
This chapter does not affect a pretrial diversion program provided pursuant to Chapter 2.7 (commencing with Section 1001).","Existing law allows individuals charged with specified crimes to qualify for deferred entry of judgment. A defendant qualifies if he or she has no conviction for any offense involving controlled substances, the charged offense did not involve violence, there is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs other than a violation that qualifies for the program, the defendant’s record does not indicate that probation or parole has ever been revoked without being completed, and the defendant’s record does not indicate that he or she has been granted diversion, deferred entry of judgment, or was convicted of a felony within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense.
Under the existing deferred entry of judgment program, an eligible defendant may have entry of judgment deferred, upon pleading guilty to the offenses charged and entering a drug treatment program for 18 months to 3 years. If the defendant does not perform satisfactorily in the program, does not benefit from the program, is convicted of specified crimes, or engages in criminal activity rendering him or her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment, the defendant’s guilty plea is entered and the court enters judgment and proceeds to schedule a sentencing hearing. If the defendant completes the program, the criminal charges are dismissed. Existing law allows the presiding judge of the superior court, with the district attorney and public defender, to establish a pretrial diversion drug program.
This bill would make the deferred entry of judgment program a pretrial diversion program. The bill would provide that a defendant qualifies for the pretrial diversion program if he or she has no prior conviction within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense for any offense involving controlled substances other than the offense that qualifies him or her for diversion, the charged offense did not involve violence, there is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs other than a violation that qualifies for the program and the defendant has no prior conviction for a serious or violent felony within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense.
Under the pretrial diversion program created by this bill, a qualifying defendant would enter a not guilty plea, and proceedings would be suspended in order for the defendant to enter a drug treatment program for 6 months to one year, or longer if requested by the defendant with good cause. The bill would require the court, if the defendant does not perform satisfactorily in the program or is convicted of specified crimes, to terminate the program and reinstate the criminal proceedings. The bill would require the criminal charges to be dismissed if the defendant completes the program.","An act to amend Sections 1000, 1000.1, 1000.2, 1000.3, 1000.4, 1000.5, and 1000.6 of, and to add Section 1000.7 to, the Penal Code, relating to deferred entry of judgment."
802,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2015.
SEC. 2.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1) According to data from the United States Census Bureau, full-time working women, on average, over the last decade, have continued to earn just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. The wage gap is greater for women of color, with African American women being paid an average of 64 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men in 2013 and Latinas being paid just 56 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men.
(2) This wage disparity amounted to a yearly average wage gap of $10,876 in 2013 between full-time working men and full-time working women. In total, the disparity represents more than $490 billion in lost wages for working women every year.
(3) Disparities in pay for women have numerous negative impacts. This pay differential shortchanges women and their families by thousands of dollars a year and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. Nearly 4 in 10 mothers are primary breadwinners in their households, and nearly two-thirds are significant earners, making pay equity critical to the economic security of their families.
(4) Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental precept in our nation and in California. Federal law, including the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Public Law 88-38), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352), and Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled Equal Employment Opportunity, specifically prohibits arbitrarily compensating men and women differently for the same work, as does California’s Equal Pay Act.
(5) On August 6, 2014, the United States Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to required covered federal contractors and subcontractors with more than 100 employees to submit an annual equal pay report on employee compensation. In California, state contractors receiving public money are obligated to comply with equal pay laws and should provide the state with aggregate wage data to advance pay equity.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to promote pay equity and nondiscrimination in setting pay and making hiring or promotional decisions, and to obtain better data on pay equity to more wholly address the problem.
SEC. 3.
Section 12990 of the Government Code is amended to read:
12990.
(a) Any employer who is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works or for goods or services is subject to the provisions of this part relating to discrimination in employment and to the nondiscrimination requirements of this section and any rules and regulations that implement it.
(b) (1) (A) (i) Prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, an employer with 100 or more employees in the state and a contract of 30 days or more shall submit a nondiscrimination program to the department and shall submit periodic reports, no more than annually, of its compliance with that program. An employer with fewer than 100 employees in the state or a contract of less than 30 days may be required to submit a nondiscrimination program and, if so required, shall comply with the requirements for employers with 100 or more employees in the state. The department may require approval and certification of a nondiscrimination program. The department shall define an employee for the purposes of this paragraph.
(ii) An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of employees, premium wage rates for all overtime worked, and regular hourly pay of not less than 30 percent of the state minimum wage rate shall be excluded from calculation of the employer’s total number of employees for purposes of this subparagraph.
(B) The changes made to this subdivision made by the act adding this subparagraph shall not be construed to negate an exemption to the requirements of this section in existence on January 1, 2016, created by the department through the exercise of its regulatory authority, or to otherwise require the department to reinterpret the validity of an exemption as a result of these changes.
(2) A nondiscrimination program shall include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, an analysis of employment selection procedures, and a workforce analysis. The workforce analysis shall include the following:
(A) The total number of workers with a specific job category identified by worker race, ethnicity, and sex.
(B) Total wages required to be reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 for all workers in a specific job category identified by worker race, ethnicity, and sex.
(C) The total hours worked on an annual basis for all workers in a specific job category identified by worker race, ethnicity, and sex. Exempt employees shall be presumed to work 40 hours a week for purposes of this reporting requirement.
(c) Every state contract and subcontract for public works or for goods or services shall contain a nondiscrimination clause prohibiting discrimination on the bases enumerated in this part by contractors or subcontractors. The nondiscrimination clause shall contain a provision requiring contractors and subcontractors to give written notice of their obligations under that clause to labor organizations with which they have a collective bargaining or other agreement. These contractual provisions shall be fully and effectively enforced. This subdivision does not apply to a credit card purchase of goods of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or less. The total amount of exemption authorized herein shall not exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) per year for each company from which a state agency is purchasing goods by credit card. It shall be the responsibility of each state agency to monitor the use of this exemption and adhere to these restrictions on these purchases.
(d) The department shall periodically develop rules and regulations for the application and implementation of this section, and submit them to the council for consideration and adoption in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1. Those rules and regulations shall describe and include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1) Procedures for the investigation, approval, certification, decertification, monitoring, and enforcement of nondiscrimination programs.
(2) The size of contracts or subcontracts below which any particular provision of this section shall not apply.
(3) The circumstances, if any, under which a contractor or subcontractor is not subject to this section.
(4) Criteria for determining the appropriate plant, region, division, or other unit of a contractor’s or subcontractor’s operation for which a nondiscrimination program is required.
(5) Procedures for coordinating the nondiscrimination requirements of this section and its implementing rules and regulations with the California Plan for Equal Opportunity in Apprenticeship, with the provisions and implementing regulations of Article 9.5 (commencing with Section 11135) of Chapter 1 of Part 1, and with comparable federal laws and regulations concerning nondiscrimination, equal employment opportunity, and affirmative action by those who contract with the United States.
(6) The basic principles and standards to guide the department in administering and implementing this section.
(e) Where a contractor or subcontractor is required to prepare an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by a federal compliance agency, that program may be filed with the department, instead of any nondiscrimination program regularly required by this section or its implementing rules and regulations. Such a program shall constitute a prima facie demonstration of compliance with this section. Where the department or a federal compliance agency has required the preparation of an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by the department or a federal compliance agency, evidence of such a program shall also constitute prima facie compliance with an ordinance or regulation of any city, city and county, or county that requires an employer to submit such a program to a local awarding agency for its approval prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with that agency.
(f) Where the department determines and certifies that the provisions of this section or its implementing rules and regulations are violated or determines a contractor or subcontractor is engaging in practices made unlawful under this part, the department may recommend appropriate sanctions to the awarding agency. Any such recommendation shall take into account the severity of the violation or violations and any other penalties, sanctions, or remedies previously imposed.","Existing law subjects an employer who is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works, or for goods or services, to various nondiscrimination requirements. Existing law authorizes requiring an employer to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing for approval and certification, prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, as well as requiring the provision of periodic reports of contractor or subcontractor compliance with that program.
This bill would enact the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2015. The bill would require an employer with 100 or more employees in state, as specified, and a contract of 30 days or more, prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and to submit periodic reports no more than annually of its compliance with that program. The bill would authorize the department to require approval and certification of the program. The bill would permit the department to require an employer with fewer than 100 employees in state or a contract of less than 30 days to submit a nondiscrimination report. The bill would require the department to define an employee for these purposes. The bill would require the nondiscrimination program to include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, an analysis of employment selection procedures, and a workforce analysis, as specified. The bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to negate certain exemptions established by regulation that predate its enactment or to require the department to reevaluate the validity of these exemptions, as specified. The bill would make a statement of legislative findings.","An act to amend Section 12990 of the Government Code, relating to discrimination."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to increase enrollment and graduation rates among students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session (Firebaugh, Ch. 814) by requiring the creation of Dream Resource Centers at public institutions of higher education.
(b) It is estimated that each year approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools, and while California has been a leader in enacting innovative and bold laws to provide opportunities for undocumented youth to attain higher education, only 20 percent of these students attend college. Many undocumented youth and their families are unaware of recent policy changes, such as the enactment of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session, the California Dream Act of 2011, and the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that make college graduation more attainable. Currently, the majority of college campuses do not have a centralized location that provides specialized support services and resources for students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session.
(c) The creation of Dream Resource Centers would save staff time and resources by streamlining all available financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session. These Dream Resource Centers would seek to empower and create a safe and welcoming environment for those students. These centers would increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates among this population.
(d) A number of college campuses have acknowledged the needs and challenges of these students and have created Dream Resource Centers. These include: the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Davis; the California State University, Los Angeles; the California State University, Fullerton; and the California State University, Northridge. These centers provide, among other things, informational workshops, legal clinics, information on programs available to undocumented immigrants, and peer mentoring and support services to increase awareness of existing programs and available resources, enhance professional development, and increase employment opportunities.

Wood Boulevard, and Golden Avenue, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The advertising display is authorized by, or in accordance with, an ordinance, including, but not limited to, a specific plan or sign district, adopted by the City of Los Angeles that regulates advertising displays by identifying the specific displays or establishing regulations that include, at a minimum, all of the following:
(A) Number of signs and total signage area allowed.
(B) Maximum individual signage area.
(C) Minimum sign separation.
(D) Illumination restrictions and regulations, including signage refresh rate, scrolling, and brightness.
(E) Illuminated sign hours of operation.
(2) The owner of the advertising display has submitted to the department a copy of the ordinance adopted by the City of Los Angeles authorizing the advertising display and identification of the provisions of the ordinance required under paragraph (1) and the department has certified that the ordinance meets the minimum requirements contained in paragraph (1).
(3) The advertising display will not advertise products, goods, or services related to tobacco, firearms, or sexually explicit material.

Due to unique circumstances concerning the locations of the advertising displays, or proposed advertising displays, set forth in this act and the need for advertising in those locations, it is necessary that an exemption from some of the provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act be provided for those displays, and the Legislature finds and declares that a general statute cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution.","The Outdoor Advertising Act provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act exempts from certain of its provisions advertising displays that advertise the business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold on the property upon which the display is placed, as specified.
This bill would exempt from those provisions of the act advertising displays located in specific geographic areas in the City of Los Angeles if those displays meet specified conditions and requirements, including the adoption of, and compliance with, an ordinance by the City of Los Angeles.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","The Psychology Licensing Law provides for the licensure and regulation of psychologists by the Board of Psychology. The law defines the practice of psychology as rendering or offering to render, for a fee, psychological services involving the application of psychological principles and methods, including the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of psychological problems and emotional and mental disorders. The law prohibits unlicensed persons from practicing psychology, but authorizes unlicensed persons, including psychological assistants who meet certain requirements and do not provide psychological services to the public for a fee, to perform limited psychological functions. The law requires applicants for licensure to, among other things, engage in at least 2 years of supervised professional experience under the direction of a licensed psychologist and authorizes an applicant who obtains this experience in the United States to send verification of the experience directly to the board if the supervising licensed psychologist fails to submit the verification within 30 days of receiving a request from the applicant, as specified. The law requires the board to establish qualifications by regulation for supervising licensed psychologists and to review and approve applicants for the position of supervising psychologist on a case-by-case basis. The law provides that a violation of any of its provisions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would remove the reference to fees for services from the definition of the practice of psychology, thereby expanding that definition. The bill would further modify that definition to specify that the application of psychological principles and methods includes assessment, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and intervention to increase effective functioning of individuals, groups, and organizations. The bill would revise the above-described authorization for psychological assistants to prohibit services to the public, except as specified, without reference to a fee. The bill would revise that experience verification procedure to require a supervising licensed psychologist to submit verification of the experience to the trainee in a manner prescribed by the board, and would authorize the board to establish alternative procedures for obtaining the necessary documentation if the supervising licensed psychologist fails to provide that verification in a timely manner. The bill would make the failure to provide verification to the board upon request, absent good cause, unprofessional conduct. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the board review and approve applicants for the position of supervising psychologist on a case-by-case basis. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law establishes for a patient of a psychotherapist, whether or not a party to a proceeding, the privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication between the patient and psychotherapist, as specified, and defines a psychotherapist for these purposes.
This bill would include in the definition of psychotherapist a person who is registered with the Board of Psychology as a registered psychologist and who is under the supervision of a licensed psychologist or a board certified psychiatrist.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 2903, 2913, and 2914 of the Business and Professions Code, and to amend Section 1010 of the Evidence Code, relating to psychologists."

SECTION 1.
Section 1205 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1205.
(a) A judgment that the defendant pay a fine, with or without other punishment, may also direct that he or she be imprisoned until the fine is satisfied and may further direct that the imprisonment begin at and continue after the expiration of any imprisonment imposed as a part of the punishment or of any other imprisonment to which the defendant may have been sentenced. The judgment shall specify the term of imprisonment for nonpayment of the fine, which shall not be more than one day for each one hundred twenty five dollars ($125) of the fine, nor exceed the term for which the defendant may be sentenced to imprisonment for the offense of which he or she has been convicted. A defendant held in custody for nonpayment of a fine shall be entitled to credit on the fine for each day he or she is held in custody, at the rate specified in the judgment. When the defendant has been convicted of a misdemeanor, a judgment that the defendant pay a fine may also direct that he or she pay the fine within a limited time or in installments on specified dates, and that in default of payment as stipulated he or she be imprisoned in the discretion of the court either until the defaulted installment is satisfied or until the fine is satisfied in full; but unless the direction is given in the judgment, the fine shall be payable.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in case of fines imposed, as a condition of probation, the defendant shall pay the fine to the clerk of the court, or to the judge if there is no clerk, unless the defendant is taken into custody for nonpayment of the fine, in which event payments made while he or she is in custody shall be made to the officer who holds the defendant in custody, and all amounts paid shall be paid over by the officer to the court that rendered the judgment. The clerk shall report to the court every default in payment of a fine or any part of that fine, or if there is no clerk, the court shall take notice of the default. If time has been given for payment of a fine or it has been made payable in installments, the court shall, upon any default in payment, immediately order the arrest of the defendant and order him or her to show cause why he or she should not be imprisoned until the fine or installment is satisfied in full. If the fine or installment is payable forthwith and it is not paid, the court shall, without further proceedings, immediately commit the defendant to the custody of the proper officer to be held in custody until the fine or installment is satisfied in full.
(c) This section applies to any violation of any of the codes or statutes of this state punishable by a fine or by a fine and imprisonment.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the clerk of the court, or the judge if there is no clerk, from turning these accounts over to another county department or a collecting agency for processing and collection.
(e) The defendant shall pay to the clerk of the court or the collecting agency a fee for the processing of installment accounts. This fee shall equal the administrative and clerical costs, as determined by the board of supervisors, or by the court, depending on which entity administers the account. The defendant shall pay to the clerk of the court or the collecting agency the fee established for the processing of the accounts receivable that are not to be paid in installments. The fee shall equal the administrative and clerical costs, as determined by the board of supervisors, or by the court, depending on which entity administers the account, except that the fee shall not exceed thir to any fine, including, but not limited to, base fines, on a proportional basis, that may be imposed, at the rate of not less than one hundred twenty five dollars ($125) per day, or more, in the discretion of the court imposing the sentence. If the total number of days in custody exceeds the number of days of the term of imprisonment to be imposed, the entire term of imprisonment shall be deemed to have been served. In any case where the court has imposed both a prison or jail term of imprisonment and a fine, any days to be credited to the defendant shall first be applied to the term of imprisonment imposed, and thereafter the remaining days, if any, shall be applied to the fine, including, but not limited to, base fines, on a proportional basis.
(b) For the purposes of this section, credit shall be given only where the custody to be credited is attributable to proceedings related to the same conduct for which the defendant has been convicted. Credit shall be given only once for a single period of custody attributable to multiple offenses for which a consecutive sentence is imposed.
(c) For the purposes of this section, “term of imprisonment” includes any period of imprisonment imposed as a condition of probation or otherwise ordered by a court in imposing or suspending the imposition of any sentence, and also includes any term of imprisonment, including any period of imprisonment prior to release on parole and any period of imprisonment and parole, prior to discharge, whether established or fixed by statute, by any court, or by any duly authorized administrative agency.
(d) It is the duty of the court imposing the sentence to determine the date or dates of any admission to, and release from, custody prior to sentencing and the total number of days to be credited pursuant to this section. The total number of days to be credited shall be contained in the abstract of judgment provided for in Section 1213.
(e) It is the duty of any agency to which a person is committed to apply the credit provided for in this section for the period between the date of sentencing and the date the person is delivered to the agency.
(f) If a defendant serves time in a camp, work furlough facility, halfway house, rehabilitation facility, hospital, juvenile detention facility, similar residential facility, or home detention program pursuant to Section 1203.016, 1203.017, or 1203.018, in lieu of imprisonment in a county jail, the time spent in these facilities or programs shall qualify as mandatory time in jail.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code as it pertains to the sentencing of convicted offenders, this section does not autho","Existing law provides that a judgment that a criminal defendant pay a fine, other than a restitution fine or order, may also direct that he or she be imprisoned until the fine is satisfied. Existing law requires the judgment to specify the term of imprisonment for nonpayment of the fine, and prohibits that term from exceeding one day for each $30 of the fine, or exceeding the term for which the defendant may be sentenced for the offense of which he or she has been convicted.
Existing law also provides that in all felony and misdemeanor convictions, either by plea or by verdict, when the defendant has been in custody, all days of custody of the defendant, as specified, are to be credited upon his or her term of imprisonment, or credited to any fine, on a proportional basis, that may be imposed, at the rate of not less than $30 per day, in the discretion of the court imposing the sentence.

811,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 12940 of the Government Code is amended to read:
12940.
It is an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California:
(a) For an employer, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment, or to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.
(1) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability, or subject an employer to any legal liability resulting from the refusal to employ or the discharge of an employee with a physical or mental disability, where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations.
(2) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee who, because of the employee’s medical condition, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee’s health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations. Nothing in this part shall subject an employer to any legal liability resulting from the refusal to employ or the discharge of an employee who, because of the employee’s medical condition, is unable to perform his or her essential duties, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee’s health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations.
(3) Nothing in this part relating to discrimination on account of marital status shall do either of the following:
(A) Affect the right of an employer to reasonably regulate, for reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale, the working of spouses in the same department, division, or facility, consistent with the rules and regulations adopted by the commission.
(B) Prohibit bona fide health plans from providing additional or greater benefits to employees with dependents than to those employees without or with fewer dependents.
(4) Nothing in this part relating to discrimination shall affect the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in hiring decisions if the employer maintains a veterans’ preference employment policy established in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 12958).
A veterans’ preference employment policy shall not be established or applied for the purpose of discriminating against an employment applicant on the basis of any protected classification in this subdivision.
(5) (A) This part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to employ an individual because of his or her age if the law compels or provides for that refusal. Promotions within the existing staff, hiring or promotion on the basis of experience and training, rehiring on the basis of seniority and prior service with the employer, or hiring under an established recruiting program from high schools, colleges, universities, or trade schools do not, in and of themselves, constitute unlawful employment practices.
(B) The provisions of this part relating to discrimination on the basis of age do not prohibit an employer from providing health benefits or health care reimbursement plans to retired persons that are altered, reduced, or eliminated when the person becomes eligible for Medicare health benefits. This subparagraph applies to all retiree health benefit plans and contractual provisions or practices concerning retiree health benefits and health care reimbursement plans in effect on or after January 1, 2011.
(b) For a labor organization, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person, to exclude, expel, or restrict from its membership the person, or to provide only second-class or segregated membership or to discriminate against any person because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of the person in the election of officers of the labor organization or in the selection of the labor organization’s staff or to discriminate in any way against any of its members, any employer, or any person employed by an employer.
(c) For any person to discriminate against any person in the selection, termination, training, or other terms or treatment of that person in any apprenticeship training program, any other training program leading to employment, an unpaid internship, or another limited duration program to provide unpaid work experience for that person because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of the person discriminated against.
(d) For any employer or employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any publication, or to make any nonjob-related inquiry of an employee or applicant, either verbal or through use of an application form, that expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification, or discrimination. This part does not prohibit an employer or employment agency from inquiring into the age of an applicant or from specifying age limitations, where the law compels or provides for that action.
(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), for any employer or employment agency to require any medical or psychological examination of an applicant, to make any medical or psychological inquiry of an applicant, to make any inquiry whether an applicant has a mental disability, physical disability, or medical condition, or to make any inquiry regarding the nature or severity of a physical disability, mental disability, or medical condition.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may inquire into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions and may respond to an applicant’s request for reasonable accommodation.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may require a medical or psychological examination or make a medical or psychological inquiry of a job applicant after an employment offer has been made but prior to the commencement of employment duties, provided that the examination or inquiry is job related and consistent with business necessity and that all entering employees in the same job classification are subject to the same examination or inquiry.
(f) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), for any employer or employment agency to require any medical or psychological examination of an employee, to make any medical or psychological inquiry of an employee, to make any inquiry whether an employee has a mental disability, physical disability, or medical condition, or to make any inquiry regarding the nature or severity of a physical disability, mental disability, or medical condition.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employer or employment agency may require any examinations or inquiries that the employer or employment agency can show to be job related and consistent with business necessity. An employer or employment agency may conduct voluntary medical examinations, including voluntary medical histories that are part of an employee health program available to employees at that worksite.
(g) For any employer, labor organization, or employment agency to harass, discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has made a report pursuant to Section 11161.8 of the Penal Code, which prohibits retaliation against hospital employees who report suspected patient abuse by health facilities or community care facilities.
(h) For any employer, labor organization, employment agency, or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.
(i) For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this part, or to attempt to do so.
(j) (1) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, or any other person, because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status, to harass an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract. Harassment of an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract by an employee, other than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. An employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees, applicants, unpaid interns or volunteers, or persons providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace, where the employer, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing cases involving the acts of nonemployees, the extent of the employer’s control and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have with respect to the conduct of those nonemployees shall be considered. An entity shall take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring. Loss of tangible job benefits shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment.
(2) This subdivision is declaratory of existing law, except for the new duties imposed on employers with regard to harassment.
(3) An employee of an entity subject to this subdivision is personally liable for any harassment prohibited by this section that is perpetrated by the employee, regardless of whether the employer or covered entity knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.
(4) (A) For purposes of this subdivision only, “employer” means any person regularly employing one or more persons or regularly receiving the services of one or more persons providing services pursuant to a contract, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the state, or any political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities. The definition of “employer” in subdivision (d) of Section 12926 applies to all provisions of this section other than this subdivision.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for purposes of this subdivision, “employer” does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit, except as provided in Section 12926.2.
(C) For purposes of this subdivision, “harassment” because of sex includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Sexually harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “a person providing services pursuant to a contract” means a person who meets all of the following criteria:
(A) The person has the right to control the performance of the contract for services and discretion as to the manner of performance.
(B) The person is customarily engaged in an independently established business.
(C) The person has control over the time and place the work is performed, supplies the tools and instruments used in the work, and performs work that requires a particular skill not ordinarily used in the course of the employer’s work.
(k) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.
(l) (1) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to refuse to hire or employ a person or to refuse to select a person for a training program leading to employment or to bar or to discharge a person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against a person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of a conflict between the person’s religious belief or observance and any employment requirement, unless the employer or other entity covered by this part demonstrates that it has explored any available reasonable alternative means of accommodating the religious belief or observance, including the possibilities of excusing the person from those duties that conflict with his or her religious belief or observance or permitting those duties to be performed at another time or by another person, but is unable to reasonably accommodate the religious belief or observance without undue hardship, as defined in subdivision (u) of Section 12926, on the conduct of the business of the employer or other entity covered by this part. Religious belief or observance, as used in this section, includes, but is not limited to, observance of a Sabbath or other religious holy day or days, reasonable time necessary for travel prior and subsequent to a religious observance, and religious dress practice and religious grooming practice as described in subdivision (q) of Section 12926. This subdivision shall also apply to an apprenticeship training program, an unpaid internship, and any other program to provide unpaid experience for a person in the workplace or industry.
(2) An accommodation of an individual’s religious dress practice or religious grooming practice is not reasonable if the accommodation requires segregation of the individual from other employees or the public.
(3) An accommodation is not required under this subdivision if it would result in a violation of this part or any other law prohibiting discrimination or protecting civil rights, including subdivision (b) of Section 51 of the Civil Code and Section 11135 of this code.
(4) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to, in addition to the employee protections provided pursuant to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted.
(m) (1) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Nothing in this subdivision or in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer or other covered entity to produce undue hardship, as defined in subdivision (u) of Section 12926, to its operation.
(2) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to, in addition to the employee protections provided pursuant to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted.

(o) For an employer or other entity covered by this part, to subject, directly or indirectly, any employee, applicant, or other person to a test for the presence of a genetic characteristic.

SEC. 2.
Article 3 (commencing with Section 12958) is added to Chapter 6 of Part 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
Article  3. Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policies
12958.
This article shall be known, and may be cited, as the “Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policy Act.”
12958.1.
As used in this article:
(a) “DD 214” means United States Department of Defense Form 214 or a similarly effective form issued by that department relating to separation from military service.
(b) “Private employer” means a business entity in the private sector of this state with one or more employees.
(c) “Veteran” means a person who served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States who was discharged or released with an honorable discharge.
(d) “Veterans’ preference employment policy” means a private employer’s voluntary preference for hiring or retaining a veteran over another qualified applicant or employee.
12958.2.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a private employer may establish and maintain a written veterans’ preference employment policy, which shall be applied uniformly to hiring decisions.
(b) An employer with a veterans’ preference employment policy may require that a veteran submit a DD 214 to be eligible for the preference.
(c) The granting of a veterans’ preference pursuant to this article, in and of itself, shall be deemed not to violate any local or state equal employment opportunity law or regulation, including, but not limited to, this chapter.
(d) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall assist any private employer in determining if an applicant is a veteran to the extent permitted by law.
(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the establishment or use of a veterans’ preference employment policy for the purpose of discriminating against
the
an
employment applicant on the basis of any protected classification in subdivision (a) of Section 12940.","Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification or applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California, to refuse to hire or employ a person or to refuse to select a person for a training program leading to employment, or to bar or discharge a person from employment or a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against a person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of that person. The California Fair Employment and Housing Act provides that nothing in that act relating to discrimination on account of sex affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in employee selection or to give special consideration to Vietnam-era veterans.
This bill would enact the Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policy Act to authorize a private employer to establish and maintain a written veterans’ preference employment policy, to be applied uniformly to hiring decisions, to give a voluntary preference for hiring or retaining a veteran over another qualified applicant or employee. The bill would provide that the granting of a veterans’ preference pursuant to the bill, in and of itself, shall be deemed not to violate any local or state equal employment opportunity law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the antidiscrimination provisions of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. The bill would revise the existing veteran status provision in the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to remove references to discrimination on account of sex and to Vietnam-era veterans, and would, instead, provide that nothing in that act relating to discrimination affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in hiring decisions if the employer maintains a veterans’ preference employment policy established in accordance with the Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policy Act.
The bill would prohibit a veterans’ preference employment policy from being established or applied for the purpose of discriminating against an employment applicant on the basis of a protected classification, as specified.","An act to amend Section 12940 of, and to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 12958) to Chapter 6 of Part 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of, the Government Code, relating to employment."

The bill also would state the Legislature’s finding and declaration that the provisions prescribing the requirements for the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, and for instructional time for physical education in an elementary school maintaining any of grades 1 to 8, inclusive, were not intended to create a private right of action, but would provide that nothing in those provisions is to restrict or expand the existing right of any party to seek relief from noncompliance with them pursuant to a writ of mandate.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

(1) The minimum contribution amount for the calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of the minimum contribution amount for the prior calendar year multiplied by the inflation factor adjustment as specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
(2) The inflation factor adjustment used for the calendar year shall be based on the figures for the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items received on or before August 1 of the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 17041.","Existing law authorizes an individual to contribute amounts in excess of his or her tax liability for the support of specified funds. Existing law also has administrative provisions applicable to voluntary contributions.

Existing law requires the department to impose certain conditions on each hazardous waste facilities permit and authorizes the department to impose other conditions on a hazardous waste facilities permit, as specified. A violation of the hazardous waste control law is a crime.
The bill would require the department, as a condition for a new hazardous waste facilities permit or a renewal of a hazardous waste facilities permit, to require a facility operator to install monitoring devices or other equipment at the fence line of the facility to monitor for potential releases from the facility into the surrounding community, except as specified. The bill would require the department to grant such a request from a member of the public for a technical assistance grant for the purpose of getting assistance relating to, and information about, a pending hazardous waste facilities permit if the department receives the request within one year of the submission of the applicable hazardous waste facilities permit application, and would authorize the department to, in its discretion, grant such a request received more than one year from the submission of the applicable permit application. The bill would require the permit applicant to fund the grants. The bill would require the department, upon receipt of an application for a new hazardous waste facilities permit or for a renewal of a hazardous waste facilities permit, to post on its Internet Web site that the application has been received, and to include with this information a description of the process for applying for a technical assistance grant.
Because a violation of the bill’s requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, requires the State Department of Developmental Services to enter into contracts with private nonprofit corporations to operate regional centers for the provision of community services and support for persons with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law sets forth the duties of the regional centers, including, but not limited to, development of individual program plans, the purchase of needed services to implement the plan, and monitoring of the delivery of those services.
Existing law requires the regional center contracts and agreements with service providers in which rates are determined through negotiations between the regional center and the service providers to expressly require that not more than 15% of regional center funds be spent on administrative costs, as defined.
This bill would require all regional center contracts or agreements with contracting entities that provide in-home respite services and that have an annual revenue attributable to in-home respite services provided to regional center consumers of at least $7,000,000, as specified, to expressly require that at least 85% of regional center funds be spent on direct service expenditures, as defined.","An act to add

The report shall provide information and statistics on the number of active investigations, arrests, indictments, and convictions. The applications for moneys, the distribution of moneys, and the annual reports shall be public documents.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, information submitted to the commissioner pursuant to this section concerning criminal investigations, whether active or inactive, shall be confidential.
(d) The commissioner may conduct a fiscal audit of the programs administered under this subdivision. If conducted, this fiscal audit shall be conducted by an internal audit unit of the department.
(e) If the commissioner determines that a district attorney or city attorney is unable or unwilling to investigate or prosecute a relevant bail abuse case, the commissioner may discontinue distribution of funds allocated for that matter and may redistribute those funds to other eligible district attorneys or city attorneys.
(f) If, as of June 30 of any calendar year, the total amount in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund exceeds eight million dollars ($8,000,000), the commissioner shall reduce the amount of the assessment accordingly for the following year to eliminate that excess. A surety insurer, upon receipt of an invoice, shall transmit payment to the department for deposit in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund. Any balance remaining in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund at the end of the fiscal year shall be retained in the account, to be available in the next fiscal year.

The Legislature finds and declares that this act imposes limits on the public’s right of access to meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following finding to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to ensure that criminal investigations are not frustrated or hindered, it is necessary to limit the public’s right of access to information submitted to the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to this act concerning criminal investigations.","(1) Existing law provides for the issuance of bail licenses under the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner. Existing law requires persons soliciting or negotiating the execution or delivery of an undertaking of bail on behalf of a surety insurer to be licensed as a bail agent.
This bill would require each surety insurer or bail permittee to pay a
fee, not to exceed $30
fee of $15
per bail bond transaction. These fees would go to the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund, created as a special account in the Insurance Fund. This bill would provide that moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund be distributed by the commissioner, upon appropriation, to fund the reasonable costs incurred in regulating entities involved in the undertaking of bail, as specified. This bill would
provide that
require the commissioner to reduce the amount of the assessment, as specified,
if the total amount in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund ever exceeds
$8,000,000, then the commissioner shall reduce the amount of the assessment, as specified.
$8,000,000.
This bill would authorize the commissioner to develop guidelines to implement or clarify these provisions. This bill would require the commissioner to provide an annual report on the department’s Internet Web site including various information, as specified.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) For many victims of domestic violence, a wireless telephone is their lifeline to the community resources, life-saving services, and support network they need to leave their batterer and abusive environment. For the majority of victims, shelter in a confidential safe house is a last resort, and, in fact, unnecessary. Victims are going about their lives, working, and taking care of their children, as they are making plans and determining their next steps to safely leave their abuser. Many victims are able to access counseling services and obtain legal assistance, such as securing a restraining order, without entering into a safe house. For these victims, a wireless telephone serves as a critical tool for making appointments and communicating with their advocates.
(b) Allowing a victim of domestic violence to retain the use of an existing wireless telephone number and access to the contacts and other information that may be contained in an existing wireless telephone is important for both the safety and emotional support of the victim. This can be a problem if the domestic violence victim is not the accountholder for the wireless telephone, as only an accountholder has the authority to release the telephone number or numbers contained in the account.
(c) According to a Wall Street Journal article, in 2011 just under 71 percent of households had a landline in the home, down from a little more than 96 percent of households 15 years earlier. Cellular telephone ownership among adults reached 89 percent in 2011, up from approximately 36 percent in 1998.
(d) A 2014 National Public Radio Survey of 72 shelters in large cities and smaller towns across the nation found that 85 percent of the shelters worked directly with victims whose abusers tracked the victims using GPS. Seventy-five percent of the shelters worked with victims whose abusers eavesdropped on their conversations remotely by using hidden mobile applications.

Section 6347 is added to the Family Code, to read:
6347.
(a) Commencing July 1, 2016, in order to ensure that the requesting party can maintain an existing wireless telephone number, and the wireless numbers of any minor children in the care of the requesting party, the court may issue an order, after notice and a hearing, directing a wireless telephone service provider to transfer the billing responsibility for and rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers to the requesting party, if the requesting party is not the accountholder.
(b) (1) The order transferring billing responsibility for and rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers to a requesting party shall be a separate order that is directed to the wireless telephone service provider. The order shall list the name and billing telephone number of the accountholder, the name and contact information of the person to whom the telephone number or numbers will be transferred, and each telephone number to be transferred to that person. The court shall ensure that the contact information of the requesting party is not provided to the accountholder in proceedings held pursuant to Division 10 (commencing with Section 6200).
(2) The order shall be served on the wireless service provider’s agent for service of process listed with the Secretary of State.
(3) Where the wireless service provider cannot operationally or technically effectuate the order due to certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, any of the following, the wireless service provider shall notify the requesting party within 72 hours of receipt of the order:
(A) When the accountholder has already terminated the account.
(B) When differences in network technology prevent the functionality of a device on the network.
(C) When there are geographic or other limitations on network or service availability.
(c) (1) Upon transfer of billing responsibility for and rights to a wireless telephone number or numbers to a requesting party pursuant to subdivision (b) by a wireless telephone service provider, the requesting party shall assume all financial responsibility for the transferred wireless telephone number or numbers, monthly service costs, and costs for any mobile device associated with the wireless telephone number or numbers.
(2) This section shall not preclude a wireless service provider from applying any routine and customary requirements for account establishment to the requesting party as part of this transfer of billing responsibility for a wireless telephone number or numbers and any devices attached to that number or numbers, including, but not limited to, identification, financial information, and customer preferences.
(d) This section shall not affect the ability of the court to apportion the assets and debts of the parties as provided for in law, or the ability to determine the temporary use, possession, and control of personal property pursuant to Sections 6324 and 6340.
(e) No cause of action shall lie against any wireless telephone service provider, its officers, employees, or agents, for actions taken in accordance with the terms of a court order issued pursuant to this section.
(f) The Judicial Council shall, on or before July 1, 2016, develop any forms or rules necessary to effectuate this section.

Existing law also authorizes a court to include these protective orders and other orders in a judgment entered in specified proceedings, including, among others, a proceeding for the dissolution of marriage. A violation of these court orders constitutes contempt of court, which is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, additionally authorize a court, after notice and a hearing, to issue an order directing a wireless telephone service provider to transfer the billing responsibility and rights to a wireless telephone number or numbers to a requesting party. The bill would require that order to be a separate order directed to the wireless telephone service provider that lists the name and billing telephone number of the accountholder, the name and contact information of the person to whom the number or numbers will be transferred, and each number to be transferred to that person. The bill would require, upon transfer of billing responsibility for and rights to a wireless telephone number or numbers, the requesting party to assume all financial responsibility for the transferred wireless telephone number or numbers, monthly service costs, and costs for any mobile device associated with the wireless telephone number or numbers. The bill would not affect the ability of the court to apportion the assets and debts of the parties as provided for in law, or the ability to determine the temporary use, possession, and control of personal property, as specified. The bill would prohibit a cause of action against a wireless telephone service provider, its officers, employees, or agents, for actions taken in accordance with the terms of the court order. The bill would require the Judicial Council to, on or before July 1, 2016, develop any forms or rules necessary to effectuate these provisions.

820,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) The State of California has officially recognized the Armenian Genocide each year for decades and has repeatedly urged the Republic of Turkey to acknowledge the facts of the Armenian Genocide and work toward a just resolution, honor its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, to end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and to return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(b) Genocide is defined by the United Nations as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
(c) Genocide denial is widely viewed as among the final stages of genocide and serves to perpetuate the effects of genocide even after the active phases of extermination, massacres, forced marches, and deportation has ended.
(d) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in an ongoing campaign of genocide denial and historical revisionism by refusing to acknowledge its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, refusing to compensate its victims, and actively pursuing a well-funded political lobbying campaign throughout the United States, including in California, to rewrite history and defeat legislation recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
(e) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in efforts to effect Armenian cultural erasure since the founding of the Republic of Turkey, including, but not limited to, ethnic cleansings and the destruction of sacred Armenian religious sites.
(f) Reference in Turkey by any scholar, journalist, or other person to the massacre and deportation of Armenians in 1915 to 1923, inclusive, as genocide can be criminally prosecuted under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.
(g) The State of California is home to the largest Armenian-American population in the United States, and Armenians living in California, most of whom are direct descendants of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide, have enriched our state through their leadership and contributions in business, agriculture, academia, government, and the arts, yet continue to suffer the effects of the continued denial campaign by the government of Turkey.
(h) The State of California, as the world’s eighth largest economy, and in accordance with principles of human rights and justice, has taken the lead in adopting legislation to divest from South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Sudan for its genocide in Darfur, and Iran for its support of international terrorism, imposing economic consequences upon regimes that engage in conduct and policy that violate human rights or constitute crimes against humanity.
(i) The State of California, through its Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and its State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS), directly invests public funds in the government of Turkey, which then reaps profits while actively denying the Armenian Genocide, funding its continued campaign of denial, at least in part, through these investments in its economy.
(j) By investing public funds in the government of Turkey, the State of California as the embodiment of its citizens contradicts its longstanding, just position of recognizing the Armenian Genocide and urging the government of Turkey to acknowledge its responsibility and work toward a just resolution by honoring its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, to end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and to return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(k) It is the government of Turkey, not the people of Turkey, that is responsible for Turkey’s continued egregious violations of human rights and active pursuit of genocide denial, cultural erasure, and historical revisionism.
(l) PERS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of $185,000,000.
(m) STRS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of several hundred million dollars.
(n) Investment in the Republic of Turkey enables its government to continue to deny justice to the Armenian people.
(o) Divesting these funds would ensure that the State of California is in no way complicit in the continued denial of the Armenian Genocide by the government of Turkey and would encourage said government to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide and to reach a fair and just resolution of reparations for the survivors of the Armenian Genocide.

If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.","The California Constitution provides that the Legislature may by statute prohibit retirement board investments if it is in the public interest to do so, and providing that the prohibition satisfies specified fiduciary standards.
Existing law prohibits the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System from investing public employee retirement funds in a company with active business operations in Sudan and in Iran, as specified.
This bill would additionally prohibit the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System from investing public employee retirement funds in a Turkish investment vehicle, as specified. The bill would require the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the Teachers’ Retirement Board of the State Teachers’ Retirement System to sell or transfer any investments in a Turkish investment vehicle.
This bill would require these boards, on or before January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, to report to the Legislature any investments in a Turkish investment vehicle and the sale or transfer of those investments, subject to the fiduciary duty of these boards.

SECTION 1.
Section 34191.4 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
34191.4.
The following provisions shall apply to any successor agency that has been issued a finding of completion by the Department of Finance:
(a) All real property and interests in real property identified in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 34179.5 shall be transferred to the Community Redevelopment Property Trust Fund of the successor agency upon approval by the Department of Finance of the long-range property management plan submitted by the successor agency pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 34191.5 unless that property is subject to the requirements of any existing enforceable obligation.
(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (c), and notwithstanding subdivision (d) of Section 34171, upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency shall be deemed to be enforceable obligations provided that the oversight board makes a finding that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
(2) If the oversight board finds that the loan is an enforceable obligation, the accumulated interest on the remaining principal amount of the loan shall be recalculated from origination at the interest rate earned by funds deposited into the Local Agency Investment Fund. The loan shall be repaid to the city, county, or city and county in accordance with a defined schedule over a reasonable term of years at an interest rate not to exceed the interest rate earned by funds deposited into the Local Agency Investment Fund. The annual loan repayments provided for in the recognized obligation payment schedules shall be subject to all of the following limitations:
(A) Loan repayments shall not be made prior to the 2013–14 fiscal year. Beginning in the 2013–14 fiscal year, the maximum repayment amount authorized each fiscal year for repayments made pursuant to this subdivision and paragraph (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 34176 combined shall be equal to one-half of the increase between the amount distributed to the taxing entities pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 34183 in that fiscal year and the amount distributed to taxing entities pursuant to that paragraph in the 2012–13 base year, provided, however, that calculation of the amount distributed to taxing entities during the 2012–13 base year shall not include any amounts distributed to taxing entities pursuant to the due diligence review process established in Sections 34179.5 to 34179.8, inclusive. Loan or deferral repayments made pursuant to this subdivision shall be second in priority to amounts to be repaid pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 34176.
(B) Repayments received by the city, county, or city and county that formed the redevelopment agency shall first be used to retire any outstanding amounts borrowed and owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of the former redevelopment agency for purposes of the Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and shall be distributed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund established by subdivision (d) of Section 34176.
(C) Twenty percent of any loan repayment shall be deducted from the loan repayment amount and shall be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund, after all outstanding loans from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund for purposes of the Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund have been paid.
(c) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) and subdivision (d) of Section 34171, upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin, where the outstanding principal balance of the loan is one million two hundred fifty thousand ($1,250,000) or less, shall be deemed to be enforceable obligations if the oversight board makes all of the following findings:
(A) The loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
(B) The loan was entered into more than two years after the creation of the former redevelopment agency, and prior to January 1, 2011.
(C) The loan was related to an indebtedness obligation.
(D) The loan is the only debt of the former redevelopment agency remaining to be paid on the recognized obligation payment schedule.
(E) The amount distributed to the taxing entities pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 34183 in the previous fiscal year was less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).
(2) Repayments of a loan described in this subdivision are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b). The accumulated interest rate shall be recalculated from origination at the interest rate of 0.25 percent.
(d) (1) Bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or before December 31, 2010, shall be used for the purposes for which the bonds were sold.
(2) (A) Notwithstanding Section 34177.3 or any other conflicting provision of law, bond proceeds in excess of the amounts needed to satisfy approved enforceable obligations shall thereafter be expended in a manner consistent with the original bond covenants. Enforceable obligations may be satisfied by the creation of reserves for projects that are the subject of the enforceable obligation and that are consistent with the contractual obligations for those projects, or by expending funds to complete the projects. An expenditure made pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute the creation of excess bond proceeds obligations to be paid from the excess proceeds. Excess bond proceeds obligations shall be listed separately on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule submitted by the successor agency.
(B) If remaining bond proceeds cannot be spent in a manner consistent with the bond covenants pursuant to subparagraph (A), the proceeds shall be used to defease the bonds or to purchase those same outstanding bonds on the open market for cancellation.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the special circumstances relating to the health and safety of the residents of the City of San Joaquin.","Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law requires the Department of Finance to issue a finding of completion to a successor agency upon confirmation by the county auditor-controller that specified payments have been fully made by the successor agency. Existing law defines “enforceable obligation” for these purposes to generally exclude any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. However, existing law provides that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency are deemed to be enforceable obligations provided that the oversight board makes a finding that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
This bill would additionally provide that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin, where the outstanding principal balance of the loan is $1,250,000 or less, are enforceable obligations if the oversight board finds, among other things, that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes, it was entered into more than 2 years after the creation of the former redevelopment agency and prior to January 1, 2011, and it is the only debt of the former redevelopment agency remaining to be paid on the recognized obligation payment schedule.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits the management of hazardous waste, except in accordance with the hazardous waste laws. Existing law requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to regulate the management and disposal of hazardous waste. Under existing regulations, the department classifies a waste as hazardous waste if the waste exceeds certain total threshold limitation concentrations, which are established by the department for various substances, including barium. A violation of the hazardous waste laws is a crime.
This bill, except as specified, would provide that used, broken cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that exceeds the total threshold limit concentration only for barium is not a waste and is not subject to regulation by the department if that panel glass meets certain requirements. The bill would provide that used, broken CRT panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that is recycled is not subject to the department’s regulations on the export of materials. The bill would prohibit the use of that CRT panel glass except in specified end uses. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In March 2014, a gas leak was detected beneath the community of Arvin, California. Families were evacuated from their homes and unable to return for several months.
(b) Existing regulations for the regular testing and evaluation of smaller diameter pipelines like the one that leaked in Arvin, California were insufficient to protect that community from a serious gas leak.
(c) In view of the Arvin, California leak, the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources should review and reassess its existing regulations for active gas pipelines that are four inches or less in diameter and update its regulations to ensure the integrity of those active gas pipelines and to prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources.
(d) Given its jurisdiction and expertise, the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources has the authority to determine the appropriate methods for assessing the integrity of active gas pipelines.
SEC. 2.
Section 101042 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
101042.
(a) If the local health officer or his or her designee is notified of a leak in an active gas pipeline, that is within the jurisdiction of the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources and within a sensitive area, pursuant to Section 3270.6 of the Public Resources Code and the local health officer or his or her designee determines that the leak poses a risk to public health or safety and that the response to the leak has been inadequate to protect the public health or safety, the local health officer or his or her designee shall, working collaboratively with the division and the owner or operator of the pipeline, do both of the following:
(1) Direct the responsible party to test, to the satisfaction of the agency overseeing the testing, the soil, air, and water in the affected area for contamination caused by the leak and disclose the results of the tests to the public.
(2) Make a determination, based on the result of the tests, on whether the leak poses a serious threat to the public health and safety of residents affected by the leak, and require the responsible party to provide assistance, including temporary relocation, to those residents if the local health officer or his or her designee so determines.
(b) If the local health officer or his or her designee determines, based on the results of the test, that the leak poses a serious threat to public health and safety, the local health officer or his or her designee shall direct the responsible party to notify all residents affected by the leak.
(c) The responsible party shall be liable for the costs incurred by the local health officer or his or her designee pursuant to this section.
(d) Providing resident assistance and reimbursement for local health officer expenses shall not relieve a responsible party from liability for damages, and a responsible party shall not condition assistance or request a waiver of liability from the recipient of the assistance.

3270.5.
(a) (1) By January 1, 2018, the division shall review and evaluate, and update as appropriate, its existing regulations regarding all active gas pipelines that are four inches or less in diameter, located in sensitive areas, and 10 years old or older. The division shall make a written finding of its review and evaluation of these pipelines.
(2) In its review and evaluation, the division shall consider existing pipeline integrity, pipeline leak detection, and other pipeline assessment requirements imposed by other regulators to determine which of these forms of assessment meet the division’s needs.
(3) The regulations shall ensure the integrity and operation of these active gas pipelines pursuant to Sections 3106 and 3270.
(b) (1) By January 1, 2018, an operator of an active gas pipeline in a sensitive area shall submit to the division, as part of compliance with pipeline management plan requirements pursuant to Section 1774.2 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, an up-to-date and accurate map identifying the location of the pipeline and other up-to-date and accurate locational information of the pipeline as determined and in a format specified by the division.
(2) The division shall perform random periodic spot check inspections to ensure that the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) is accurately reported.
(3) The division shall maintain a list of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas.
(c) For purposes of this section, the following terms are defined as follows:
(1) “Active gas pipeline” means an inservice gas pipeline regardless of diameter that is within the division’s jurisdiction.
(2) “Sensitive area” means any of the following:
(A) An area containing a building intended for human occupancy, such as a residence, school, hospital, or business, that is located within 300 feet of an active gas pipeline and that is not necessary to the operation of the pipeline.
(B) An area determined by the supervisor to present significant potential threat to life, health, property, or natural resources in the event of a leak from an active gas pipeline.
(C) An area determined by the supervisor to have an active gas pipeline that has a history of chronic leaks.
(d) This section does not affect or limit the authority of the supervisor pursuant to Section 3106, 3270, or any other section of this code, or any regulation implementing those sections.
SEC. 4.
Section 3270.6 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources to prescribe minimum facility maintenance standards for oil and gas production facilities, including pipelines that are not under the jurisdiction of the State Fire Marshal. Under the division’s regulations, an owner or operator of an active environmentally sensitive gas pipeline that is a gathering line or an urban pipeline over 4 inches in diameter is required to perform a mechanical integrity test on the pipeline every 2 years, unless it is less than 10 years old.
This bill would require the division, by January 1, 2018, to review and evaluate, and update as appropriate, its existing regulations regarding all active gas pipelines that are 4 inches or less in diameter, in sensitive areas, and 10 years old or older, as specified. The bill would define active gas pipelines as inservice gas pipelines of any diameter within the division’s jurisdiction. The bill would require operators of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas, by January 1, 2018, to submit to the division maps identifying the location of those pipelines and other locational information, as provided. The bill would require the division to perform random periodic spot check inspections to ensure that the submitted maps are accurately reported. The bill would require the division to maintain a list of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas.
Existing law establishes local health departments, under the purview of the local health officer. Existing law prescribes various duties for those local health departments, including supervising remediation when hazardous waste is released and enforcing statutes relating to public health.
This bill would require a local health officer or his or her designee, if he or she is notified of a leak in an active gas pipeline within a sensitive area and makes certain determinations, to take certain actions related to the leak, working collaboratively with the division and the owner or operator of that pipeline. The bill would require the local public health officer or his or her designee to direct the responsible party to notify residents affected by the leak if he or she determines that the leak poses a serious threat to public health and safety. Because the bill would require a local health officer or his or her designee to provide a higher level of service to the public, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require an owner or operator of an active gas pipeline in a sensitive area, upon discovery of a leak from the pipeline, to notify the division and the appropriate local health officer or his or her designee of the leak. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to add Section 101042 to the Health and Safety Code, and to add Sections 3270.5 and 3270.6 to the Public Resources Code, relating to oil and gas."

(b) The determination of capacity for informed consent for adults housed in state prison is more appropriately conducted at the institution where the patient is housed and can attend, if he or she desires.
(c) Because of the confinement of these adults and their frequent movement between institutions, existing protections for patients regarding health care decisionmaking are inadequate.
(d) Existing statutory schemes centered on life-threatening emergent illness and court-ordered decisionmakers do not adequately address the needs of adults housed in state prison to have their capacity issues addressed and adjudicated by a neutral third party, even in the absence of a serious or life-threatening medical emergency.

(C) There is no person with legal authority to provide informed consent for, or make decisions concerning the health care of, the inmate patient.
(2) Preference shall be given to the next of kin or a family member as a surrogate decisionmaker over other potential surrogate decisionmakers unless those individuals are unsuitable or unable to serve.
(c) The petition required by subdivision (b) shall allege all of the following:
(1) The inmate patient’s current physical condition, describing the health care conditions currently afflicting the inmate patient.

(4) An identification of a link, if any, between the deficits identified pursuant to paragraph (3) and an explanation of how the deficits identified pursuant to that paragraph result in the inmate patient’s inability to participate in a decision about his or her health care either knowingly and intelligently or by means of a rational thought process.
(5) A discussion of whether the deficits identified pursuant to paragraph (3) are transient, fixed, or likely to change during the proposed year-long duration of the court order.
(6) The efforts made to obtain informed consent or refusal from the inmate patient and the results of those efforts.
(7) The efforts made to locate next of kin who could act as a surrogate decisionmaker for the inmate patient. If those individuals are located, all of the following shall also be included, so far as the information is known:

(9) A discussion of the inmate patient’s desires, if known, and whether there is an advance health care directive, Physicians Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST), or other documented indication of the inmate patient’s directives or desires and how those indications might influence the decision to issue an order. Additionally, any known POLST or Advanced Health Care Directives executed while the inmate patient had capacity shall be disclosed.
(10) The petitioner’s recommendation specifying a qualified and willing surrogate decisionmaker as described in subdivision (q), and the reasons for that recommendation.

Counsel shall also have access to all health care appeals filed by the inmate patient and responses to those appeals, and, to the extent available, any habeas corpus petitions or health care related litigation filed by, or on behalf of, the inmate patient.
(4) The renewal petition shall request the matter be reviewed by an administrative law judge, and allege all of the following:
(A) The current status of each of the elements set forth in paragraphs (1) to (8), inclusive, of subdivision (c).
(B) Whether the inmate patient still requires a surrogate decisionmaker.
(C) Whether the inmate patient continues to lack capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision.
(l) A licensed physician or dentist who submits a petition pursuant to this section shall not be required to obtain a court order pursuant to Section 3201 of the Probate Code prior to administering care that requires informed consent.
(m) This section does not affect the right of an inmate patient who has been determined to lack capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision and for whom a surrogate decisionmaker has been appointed to do either of the following:
(1) Seek appropriate judicial relief to review the determination or appointment by filing a petition for writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

(B) Reasonable efforts have been made to obtain informed consent from the inmate patient.
(C) As a result of one or more deficits in his or her mental functions, the inmate patient lacks capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision and is unlikely to regain that capacity over the next year.
(D) Reasonable efforts have been made to identify family members or relatives who could serve as a surrogate decisionmaker for the inmate patient.
(2) The written decision shall also specify and describe any advance health care directives, POLST, or other documented indication of the inmate patient’s directives or desires regarding health care that were created and validly executed while the inmate patient had capacity.
(q) (1) If all findings required by subdivision (p) are made, the administrative law judge shall appoint a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for the inmate patient. In doing so, the administrative law judge shall consider all reasonable options presented, including those identified in the petition, and weigh how the proposed surrogate decisionmaker would represent the best interests of the inmate patient, the efficacy of achieving timely surrogate decisions, and the urgency of the situation. Family members or relatives of the inmate patient should be appointed when possible if such an individual is available and the administrative law judge determines the family member or relative will act in the inmate patient’s best interests.
(2) An employee of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or other peace officer, shall not be appointed surrogate decisionmaker for health care for any inmate patient under this section, unless either of the following conditions apply:
(A) The individual is a family member or relative of the inmate patient and will, as determined by the administrative law judge, act in the inmate patient’s best interests and consider the inmate patient’s personal values and other wishes to the extent those values and wishes are known.
(B) The individual is a health care staff member in a managerial position and does not provide direct care to the inmate patient. A surrogate decisionmaker appointed under this subparagraph may be specified by his or her functional role at the institution, such as “Chief Physician and Surgeon” or “Chief Medical Executive” to provide clarity as to the active decisionmaker at the institution where the inmate patient is housed, and to anticipate potential personnel changes. When the surrogate decisionmaker is specified by position, rather than by name, the person occupying that specified role at the institution at which the inmate patient is currently housed shall be considered and act as the appointed surrogate decisionmaker.
(3) The order appointing the surrogate decisionmaker shall be written and state the basis for the decision by reference to the particular mandates of this subdivision. The order shall also state that the surrogate decisionmaker shall honor and follow any advance health care directive, POLST, or other documented indication of the inmate patient’s directives or desires, and specify any such directive, order, or documented desire.
(4) The surrogate decisionmaker shall follow the inmate patient’s personal values and other wishes to the extent those values and wishes are known.
(r) The administrative law judge’s written decision and order appointing a surrogate decisionmaker shall be placed in the inmate patient’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation health care record.
(s) An order entered under this section is valid for one year and the expiration date shall be written on the order. The order shall be valid at any state correctional facility within California. If the inmate patient is moved, the sending institution shall inform the receiving institution of the existence of an order entered under this section.
(t) (1) This section applies only to orders appointing a surrogate decisionmaker with authority to make a health care decision for an inmate patient who lacks capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision.
(2) This section does not apply to existing law regarding health care to be provided in an emergency or existing law governing health care for unemancipated minors. This section shall not be used for the purposes of determining or directing an inmate patient’s control over finances, marital status, or for convulsive treatment, as described in Section 5325 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, psychosurgery, as defined in Section 5325 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, sterilization, abortion, or involuntary administration of psychiatric medication, as described in Section 2602.
(u) The Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.","Existing law provides for the designation and selection of health care surrogates, and for the manner of making health care decisions for patients without surrogates.
Existing law prohibits the administration of psychiatric medication to an inmate in state prison on a nonemergency basis without the inmate’s informed consent, unless certain conditions are satisfied, including, among other things, that a psychiatrist determines that the inmate is gravely disabled and does not have the capacity to refuse treatment with psychiatric medication. Existing law authorizes a physician to administer psychiatric medication to a prison inmate in specified emergency situations.
This bill would, except as provided, establish a process for a licensed physician or dentist to file a petition with the Office of Administrative Hearings to request that an administrative law judge make a determination as to a patient’s capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision, and request appointment of a surrogate decisionmaker, if the patient is an adult housed in state prison, the physician or dentist is unable to obtain informed consent from the inmate patient because the physician or dentist determines that the inmate patient appears to lack capacity to provide informed consent or make a health care decision, and there is no person with legal authority to provide informed consent for, or make decisions concerning the health care of, the inmate patient. The bill would require the petition to contain specified information, including, among other things, the inmate patient’s current physical condition and a description of the health care conditions currently afflicting the inmate patient.
This bill would require that the petition be served on the inmate patient and his or her counsel, and filed with the office, as provided. The bill would also require that the inmate patient be provided with counsel and a written notice advising him or her of, among other things, the inmate patient’s right to be present at the hearing. Except as specified, the bill would require that the inmate patient be provided with a hearing before an administrative law judge within 30 days of the date of filing the petition. In case of an emergency, as defined, the bill would authorize the inmate patient’s physician or dentist to administer a medical intervention that requires informed consent prior to the date of the administrative hearing and would require that counsel for the inmate patient be notified by the physician or dentist. The bill would require the administrative law judge to determine and provide a written order and findings setting forth whether there has been clear and convincing evidence that, among other things, the inmate patient lacks capacity to give informed consent or make a health care decision. If the findings required by these provisions are made, the bill would require the administrative law judge to appoint a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for the inmate patient, as provided, which would be valid for one year and would be valid at any state correctional facility within California. The bill would also provide for a process to renew the appointment of the surrogate decisionmaker. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out these provisions.","An act to add Section 2604 to the Penal Code, relating to medical treatment of prisoners."

SECTION 1.
Section 1190 of the Harbors and Navigation Code is amended to read:
1190.
(a) Every vessel spoken inward or outward bound shall pay the following rate of bar pilotage through the Golden Gate and into or out of the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun:
(1) Eight dollars and eleven cents ($8.11) per draft foot of the vessel’s deepest draft and fractions of a foot pro rata, and an additional charge of 73.01 mills per high gross registered ton as changed pursuant to law in effect on December 31, 1999. The mill rates established by this paragraph may be changed as follows:
(A) (i) On and after January 1, 2010, if the number of pilots licensed by the board is 58 or 59 pilots, the mill rate in effect on December 31, 2006, shall be decreased by an incremental amount that is proportionate to one-half of the last audited annual average net income per pilot for each pilot licensed by the board below 60 pilots.
(ii) On and after January 1, 2010, if the number of pilots licensed by the board is fewer than 58 pilots, the mill rate in effect on December 31, 2006, shall be adjusted in accordance with the method described in clause (i) as though there are 58 pilots licensed by the board.
(iii) The incremental mill rate adjustment authorized by this subparagraph shall be calculated using the data reported to the board for the number of gross registered tons handled by pilots licensed under this division during the same 12-month period as the audited annual average net income per pilot. The incremental mill rate adjustment shall become effective at the beginning of the immediately following quarter, commencing January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1, as directed by the board.
(iv) On and after January 1, 2010, if, during any quarter described in this paragraph, the number of pilots licensed by the board is equal to or greater than 60, clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, shall become inoperative on the first day of the immediately following quarter.
(B) There shall be an incremental rate of additional mills per high gross registered ton as is necessary and authorized by the board to recover the pilots’ costs of obtaining new pilot boats and of funding design and engineering modifications for the purposes of extending the service life of existing pilot boats, excluding costs for repair or maintenance. The incremental mill rate charge authorized by this subparagraph shall be identified as a pilot boat surcharge on the pilots’ invoices and separately accounted for in the accounting required by Section 1136. Net proceeds from the sale of existing pilot boats shall be used to reduce the debt on the new pilot boats and any debt associated with the modification of pilot boats under this subparagraph. The board may adjust a pilot boat surcharge to reflect any associated operational savings resulting from the modification of pilot boats under this subparagraph, including, but not limited to, reduced repair and maintenance expenses.
(C) In addition to the incremental rate specified in subparagraph (B), the mill rate established by this subdivision may be adjusted at the direction of the board if, after a hearing conducted pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the board determines that there has been a catastrophic cost increase to the pilots that would result in at least a 2-percent increase in the overall annual cost of providing pilot services.
(2) A minimum charge for bar pilotage shall be six hundred sixty-two dollars ($662) for each vessel piloted.
(3) The vessel’s deepest draft shall be the maximum draft attained, on a stillwater basis, at any part of the vessel during the course of such transit inward or outward.
(b) The rate specified in subdivision (a) shall apply only to a pilotage that passes through the Golden Gate to or from the high seas to or from a berth within an area bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge to the north and Hunter’s Point to the south. The rate for pilotage to or from the high seas to or from a point past the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge or Hunter’s Point shall include a movement fee in addition to the basic bar pilotage rate as specified by the board pursuant to Section 1191.
(c) The rate established in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) shall be for a trip from the high seas to dock or from the dock to high seas. The rate specified in Section 1191 shall not be charged by pilots for docking and undocking vessels. This subdivision does not apply to the rates charged by inland pilots for their services.
(d) The board shall determine the number of pilots to be licensed based on the 1986 manpower study adopted by the board.
(e) Consistent with the board’s May 2002 adoption of rate recommendations, the rates imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) that are in effect on December 31, 2002, shall be increased by 4 percent on January 1, 2003; those in effect on December 31, 2003, shall be increased by 4 percent on January 1, 2004; those in effect on December 31, 2004, shall be increased by 3 percent on January 1, 2005; and those in effect on December 31, 2005, shall be increased by 3 percent on January 1, 2006.

(b) The software, equipment, and technology covered by this section shall be used strictly and exclusively to aid in piloting on the pilotage grounds.
(c) The movement fee authorized by this section shall be identified as a navigation technology surcharge on a pilot’s invoices and separately accounted for in the accounting required by subdivision (b) of Section 1136.
(d) The cumulative amount of the surcharge collected pursuant to this section shall not exceed one million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000).
(e) The board shall review and adjust as necessary the navigation technology surcharge authorized by this section at least quarterly.
(f) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of pilots for Monterey Bay and the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun by the Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun within the Transportation Agency.

Existing law specifies that supportive services include, among other things, domestic services, personal care services, and paramedical services that make it possible for the recipient to establish and maintain an independent living arrangement.
This bill would authorize an applicant for, or recipient of, in-home supportive services to designate an individual to act as his or her authorized representative for purposes of the IHSS program. The bill would define “authorized representative” to mean an individual who is designated in writing, on a form developed by the State Department of Social Services, by an applicant or recipient to accompany, assist, and represent the applicant or recipient for specified purposes related to the program. The bill would require the form to specify the responsibilities to be performed by the authorized representative and to provide that the designation may be changed or revoked at any time by the applicant or recipient. The bill would also provide that the authorized representative has the responsibility to act in the applicant or recipient’s best interest. The bill would exclude certain persons from serving as an authorized representative, including a person who is prohibited from being a provider of services following a conviction for, or incarceration following a conviction for, fraud against a government health care or supportive services program. The bill would require the department, in consultation with specified parties, including representatives of applicants for, and recipients of, services, to develop a form for this purpose, as specified. The bill would require a county to retain the original form that designates an authorized representative in the applicant or recipient’s IHSS case file, and to provide copies of the form to the applicant or recipient and to the authorized representative. By creating additional duties for local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the department to implement and administer these provisions through all-county letters or similar instructions until regulations are adopted, and would require the department to, no later than July 1, 2016, adopt emergency regulations.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 12300.3 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public social services."

Section 2.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 2102 of the Elections Code, as amended by Section 6.5 of Chapter 909 of the Statutes of 2014, proposed by both this bill and Senate Bill 589. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, (2) each bill amends Section 2102 of the Elections Code, as amended by Section 6.5 of Chapter 909 of the Statutes of 2014, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 589, in which case Section 2 of this bill shall not become operative.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the federal National Voter Registration Act of 1993, requires a state to, among other things, establish procedures to register a person to vote by application made simultaneously with an application for a new or renewal of a motor vehicle driver’s license. The federal act requires the motor vehicle driver’s license application to serve as an application for voter registration with respect to an election for federal office, unless the applicant fails to sign the application, and requires the application to be considered as updating the applicant’s previous voter registration, if any. The federal act defines “motor vehicle driver’s license” to include any personal identification document issued by a state motor vehicle authority.
Under existing state law, a person may not be registered to vote except by affidavit of registration. Existing law requires a properly executed affidavit of registration to be deemed effective upon receipt of the affidavit by the county elections official if the affidavit is submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles on or before the 15th day before the election. Existing state law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Secretary of State to develop a process and the infrastructure to allow a person who is qualified to register to vote in the state to register to vote online.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses and state identification cards to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver’s license or state identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.
This bill would require the Secretary of State and the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish the California New Motor Voter Program for the purpose of increasing opportunities for voter registration by any person who is qualified to be a voter. Under the program, after the Secretary of State certifies that certain enumerated conditions are satisfied, the Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to electronically provide to the Secretary of State the records of each person who is issued an original or renewal of a driver’s license or state identification card or who provides the department with a change of address, as specified. The person’s motor vehicle records would then constitute a completed affidavit of registration and the person would be registered to vote, unless the person affirmatively declined to be registered to vote during a transaction with the department, the department did not represent to the Secretary of State that the person attested that he or she meets all voter eligibility requirements, as specified, or the Secretary of State determines that the person is ineligible to vote. The bill would require the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to implement this program, as specified.
Under existing law, the willful, unauthorized disclosure of information from a Department of Motor Vehicles record to any person, or the use of any false representation to obtain information from a department record or any use of information obtained from any department record for a purpose other than the one stated in the request or the sale or other distribution of the information to a person or organization for purposes not disclosed in the request is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both fine and imprisonment.
This bill would provide that disclosure of information contained in the records obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to the California New Motor Voter Program is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, authorizes every state agency to maintain in its records only personal information that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency, or is required or authorized by state or federal law. That act specifies the situations in which disclosure is permissible and also specifies the manner in which agencies must account for disclosures of personal information, including those due to security breaches, among other provisions.
This bill would require the Secretary of State to establish procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of information acquired from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to the California New Motor Voter Program and would state that the provisions of the Information Practices Act of 1977 govern disclosures pursuant to the program.
Existing law makes it a crime for a person to willfully cause, procure, or allow himself or herself or any other person to be registered as a voter, knowing that he or she or that other person is not entitled to registration. Existing law also makes it a crime to fraudulently vote or attempt to vote.
This bill would provide that if a person who is ineligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New Motor Voter Program in the absence of a violation by that person of the crime described above, that person’s registration shall be presumed to have been effected with official authorization and not the fault of that person. The bill would also provide that if a person who is ineligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of this program, and that person votes or attempts to vote in an election held after the effective date of the person’s registration, that person shall be presumed to have acted with official authorization and is not guilty of fraudulently voting or attempting to vote, unless that person willfully votes or attempts to vote knowing that he or she is not entitled to vote.
This bill would also make conforming changes.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 2102 of the Elections Code, proposed by SB 589, that would become operative only if SB 589 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 2100 and 2102 of, and to add Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 2260) to Division 2 of the Elections Code, relating to elections."

SECTION 1.
Section 67386 of the Education Code is amended to read:
67386.
(a) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing
boards of
board of each
independent postsecondary
institutions
institution
shall adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, as defined in the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1092(f)) involving a student, both on and off campus. The policy shall include all of the following:
(1) An affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity. “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity
,
and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.
(2) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:
(A) The accused’s belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the accused.
(B) The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented.
(3) A policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is the preponderance of the evidence.
(4) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances:
(A) The complainant was asleep or unconscious.
(B) The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.
(C) The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.
(b) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing
boards of
board of each
independent postsecondary

shall adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards. At a minimum, the policies and protocols shall cover all of the following:
(1) A policy statement on how the institution will provide appropriate protections for the privacy of individuals involved, including confidentiality.
(2) Initial response by the institution’s personnel to a report of an incident, including requirements specific to assisting the victim, providing information in writing about the importance of preserving evidence, and the identification and location of witnesses.
(3) Response to stranger and nonstranger sexual assault.
(4) The preliminary victim interview, including the development of a victim interview protocol, and a comprehensive followup victim interview, as appropriate.
(5) Contacting and interviewing the accused.
(6) Seeking the identification and location of witnesses.
(7) Providing written notification to the victim about the availability of, and contact information for, on- and off-campus resources and services, and coordination with law enforcement, as appropriate.
(8) Participation of victim advocates and other supporting people.
(9) Investigating allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident.
(10) Providing that an individual who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of the institution’s student conduct policy at or near the time of the incident, unless the institution determines that the violation was egregious, including, but not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.
(11) The role of the institutional staff supervision.
(12) A comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.
(13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties.

A comprehensive prevention program shall include a range of prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, empowerment programming for victim prevention, awareness raising campaigns, primary prevention, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Outreach programs shall be provided to make students aware of the institution’s policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. At a minimum, an outreach program shall include a process for contacting and informing the student body, campus organizations, athletic programs, and student groups about the institution’s overall sexual assault policy, the practical implications of an affirmative consent standard, and the rights and responsibilities of students under the policy.
(e) Outreach programming shall be included as part of every incoming student’s orientation.","Existing law requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions to adopt and implement written procedures or protocols to ensure that students, faculty, and staff who are victims of sexual assault on the grounds or facilities of their institutions receive treatment and information, including a description of on-campus and off-campus resources.
Existing law also requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to adopt policies concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking that include certain elements, including an affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by a complainant. Existing law also requires these governing boards, in order to receive those state funds, to adopt certain sexual assault policies and protocols, as specified, and requires the governing boards, to the extent feasible, to enter into memoranda of understanding or other agreements or collaborative partnerships with on-campus and community-based organizations to refer students for assistance or make services available to students. Existing law also requires the governing boards, in order to receive those state funds, to implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Existing law provides that individuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical facilities, public facilities, and other public places.
(b)
Existing law prescribes a process for bringing an action to remedy issues of accessibility and provides that a person aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by a violation of these rights may bring an action for damages.
(c)
Legislation enacted in 2012 requires an attorney to provide a written advisory with each demand letter or complaint to a defendant or potential defendant for any construction-related accessibility claim. Certain basic review requirements are also required prior to sending a demand letter. This legislation did not and does not apply to public facilities.
(d)
It is the mission of community colleges and school districts to provide quality educational programs and services that address the diverse needs of students and communities throughout the state.
(e)
California’s community colleges place a heavy importance on providing quality educational facilities that are accessible to all members of the community.
(f)
Community colleges and local educational agencies, as well as other public agencies, are subject to design and construction oversight by the Division of the State Architect. The Division of the State Architect evaluates compliance with building code and Education Code requirements for accessibility, structural safety, and fire and life safety on new construction projects and on modernization projects.
(g)
As part of its responsibilities, the Division of the State Architect performs a project closeout to determine that the project complies with codes and regulations governing school construction, including accessibility. This process examines facilities for specific requirements before, during, and after construction to ensure any outstanding issues have been resolved. At the end of construction, the Division of the State Architect issues a closeout letter for the project that indicates compliance with applicable rules and regulations.
(h)
In light of the participation of the Division of the State Architect in the design and construction of facilities of community colleges and local educational agencies, it is appropriate that these facilities receive additional protections already extended to private defendants in construction-accessibility actions.

(a) For any action commenced on or after January 1, 2016, or for an action commenced prior to that date for which a final judgment has not been entered, the following shall apply:
(1) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or before September 15, 2010, that complies with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards are deemed not in violation of this part.
(2) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, that complies with either the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design are deemed not in violation of this part.
(3) New construction or alteration of a structure conducted by a public entity on or after March 15, 2012, that complies with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or the applicable code in place at the time of construction or alteration are deemed not in violation of this part.
(4) Elements in existing facilities of a public entity that have not been altered on or before March 15, 2012, that comply with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design or 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design are deemed not in violation of this part.
(b) A public entity’s possession of a closeout letter from the State Architect certifying that the public buildings, public facilities, and other public places to which the letter applies meet the applicable building and construction-related accessibility standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act shall serve as presumptive evidence that the public buildings, facilities, and places are in compliance with this part and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.

Section 55.52 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
55.52.
(a) For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
(1) “Construction-related accessibility claim” means any civil claim in a civil action with respect to a place of public accommodation, including, but not limited to, a claim brought under Section 51, 54, 54.1, or 55, based wholly or in part on an alleged violation of any construction-related accessibility standard, as defined in paragraph (6).
(2) “Application for stay and early evaluation conference” means an application to be filed with the court that meets the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 55.54.
(3) “Certified access specialist” or “CASp” means any person who has been certified pursuant to Section 4459.5 of the Government Code.
(4) “Meets applicable standards” means the site was inspected by a CASp and determined to meet all applicable construction-related accessibility standards pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.53. A site that is “CASp inspected” on or before the effective date of the amendments made to this section by Senate Bill 1186 of the 2011–12 Regular Session of the Legislature means that the site “meets applicable standards.”
(5) “Inspected by a CASp” means the site was inspected by a CASp and is pending a determination by the CASp that the site meets applicable construction-related accessibility standards pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 55.53. A site that is “CASp determination pending” on or before the effective date of the amendments made to this section by Senate Bill 1186 of the 2011–12 Regular Session of the Legislature means that the site was “inspected by a CASp.”
(6) “Construction-related accessibility standard” means a provision, standard, or regulation under state or federal law requiring compliance with standards for making new construction and existing facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, including, but not limited to, any provision, standard, or regulation set forth in Section 51, 54, 54.1, or 55 of this code, Section 19955.5 of the Health and Safety Code, the California Building Standards Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations), the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336; 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.), and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (Appendix A to Part 36 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations).
(7) (A) “Place of public accommodation” has the same meaning as “public accommodation,” as set forth in Section 12181(7) of Title 42 of the United States Code and the federal regulations adopted pursuant to that section.
(B) For any action commenced on or after that January 1, 2016, or for an action commenced prior to that date for which a final judgment has not been entered, “place of public accommodation” also means public buildings, public facilities, and other public places of
an educational institution of
a public entity as defined in Section 12131(1) of Title 42 of the United States Code and any related federal regulations.
(8) “Qualified defendant” means a defendant in an action that includes a construction-related accessibility claim that is asserted against a place of public accommodation that met the requirements of “meets applicable standards” or “inspected by a CASp” prior to the date the defendant was served with the summons and complaint in that action. To be a qualified defendant, the defendant is not required to have been the party who hired any CASp, so long as the basis of the alleged liability of the defendant is a construction-related accessibility claim. To determine whether a defendant is a qualified defendant, the court need not make a finding that the place of public accommodation complies with all applicable construction-related accessibility standards as a matter of law. The court need only determine that the place of public accommodation has a status of “meets applicable standards” or “inspected by a CASp.”
(9) “Site” means a place of public accommodation.
(b) Unless otherwise indicated, terms used in this part relating to civil procedure have the same meanings that those terms have in the Code of Civil Procedure.","Existing law provides that individuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public facilities, and other public places. Existing law prescribes a process for prosecuting an action in this regard and provides that a person aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by a violation of these rights may bring an action for damages and that a prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.
This bill would except from the application of these provisions public buildings, public facilities, and other public places of a public entity that, on specified dates, met specified disability access design standards. The bill would provide that a public entity’s possession of a close out letter from the State Architect certifying that the buildings, facilities, and other places to which the letter applies meet the applicable building and construction-related accessibility standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act serves as presumptive evidence that the public buildings, facilities, and places are in compliance with this part and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
Existing law prescribes a process in certain construction-related accessibility claims against a place of public accommodation. This process permits statutory damages to be awarded against a place of public accommodation only if the violation denied the plaintiff full and equal access to the place of public accommodation on a particular occasion. This process also reduces a defendant’s minimum statutory damage liability to $1,000 if the defendant demonstrates that it has corrected all construction-related violations that are the basis of a claim within 60 days of being served with the complaint, and other select conditions are met.
This bill would apply the process described above to an action commenced on or after that January 1, 2016, or an action commenced prior to that date for which a final judgment has not been entered, to public buildings, public facilities, and other public places of
an educational institution of
a public entity by revising the definition of a place of public accommodation.","An act to amend Section 55.52 of, and to add Section 54.26 to, the Civil Code, relating to civil rights."
836,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Harmful blooms of algae in the waters of the state, including, but not limited to, coastal lakes, estuaries, rivers and streams, wetlands, and inland lakes and reservoirs, represent a threat to water supplies, human health, endangered wildlife, and recreational activities.
(b) Degradation of watersheds, nutrient loading, increased water diversions, and climate change have been linked to the global expansion of harmful algal blooms, with high toxin production noted regularly in lakes, rivers, and other waters of the state.
(c) The state’s waters are especially prone to harmful algal blooms due to our warm climate, numerous water diversions, and stressed waterways.
(d) Harmful algae can produce potent hepatotoxins and neurotoxins, collectively referred to as cyanotoxins. Microcystins are the most commonly found cyanotoxin in the state’s impacted waters. Other cyanotoxins, such as the neurotoxins anatoxin-a and saxitoxin, are also present in California’s waters, but, at present, little is known about them.
(e) Cyanotoxins are poisonous to humans, pets, livestock, birds, and other wildlife via ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure. A single dose of microcystin can cause prolonged toxicity by cycling repeatedly between the liver and intestines.
(f) Harmful algal blooms of microcystins are occurring in waters throughout California, and are threatening our water supply and health. Areas with recurrent and worsening cyanotoxin pollution include the Klamath and Sacramento Rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (from the Sacramento Delta to San Francisco Bay), and Clear Lake. Pinto Lake, Copco Lake, Iron Gate Reservoir, and three segments of the Klamath River have been listed as impaired due to cyanobacteria. Bird deaths attributed to microcystins have also been reported from the Salton Sea.
(g) A harmful algal bloom in the Pacific Ocean is currently threatening the harvest of Dungeness crabs, an important and lucrative state industry. The algal bloom could affect the Dungeness crab population in the ports of Crescent City, Trinity, Eureka, Fort Bragg, Bodega Bay, San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, and Morro Bay.
(h) The Pinto Lake watershed is being evaluated for total maximum daily load (TMDL) regulation for microcystin, and was considered for remediation as an Environmental Protection Agency “superfund” site.
(i) California’s southern sea otters, a state and federally listed threatened species, have died from microcystin poisoning. The source of sea otter exposure appears to be microcystin-contaminated freshwater runoff and possibly contaminated prey species.
(j) Sea otters and humans eat some of the same marine foods that can concentrate microcystin in body tissues; hence, food safety is a public health concern. Freshwater and marine fish and shellfish have not been routinely tested for cyanotoxins in California and limited diagnostic testing is available.
(k) The state needs a coordinated multiagency effort to develop actions and projects that will prevent or mitigate toxic blooms and associated cyanotoxin pollution.

(a) “Board” means the State Water Resources Control Board.
(b) “Task force” means the Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force created pursuant to Section 31422.
(c) “Waters of the state” means any surface waters in the state, including, but not limited to, coastal lakes, lagoons and estuaries, rivers, streams, inland lakes and reservoirs, wetlands, and marine waters.
31422.
(a) The board shall establish and coordinate the Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, comprised of a representative of each of the State Department of Public Health, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Food and Agriculture, the conservancy, and other relevant agency representatives, to be determined by the chairperson of the board, in consultation with the Secretary for Environmental Protection. The board may augment an existing task force or network to accomplish the requirements of this chapter.

31423.
The functions and duties of the task force include all of the following:
(a) Assess and prioritize the actions and research necessary to develop measures that prevent or sustainably mitigate toxic algal blooms in the waters of the state. The assessment shall consider the linked impacts of toxic algal blooms and cyanotoxins on human and animal health, as well as in the context of ecosystem health and water quality.
(b) Solicit and review proposals from universities, local governments, California Native American tribes, and nonprofit organizations for applied research, projects, and programs that accomplish both of the following:
(1) Contribute to development of strategies or implementation of activities that prevent or sustainably mitigate harmful algal blooms, including cyanotoxins and microcystin pollution in the waters of the state.
(2) Establish harmful algal bloom monitoring programs or develop laboratory capacity for analyzing water samples for harmful algal bloom pollution.
(c) Provide funding recommendations to the chairperson of the board and to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Wildlife Conservation Board, the conservancy, other members of the task force, and other relevant agency representatives for those proposals for applied research, projects, and programs, described in subdivision (b), that the task force determines will contribute to the development of prevention strategies and sustainable mitigation actions to address harmful algal blooms.
(d) Review the risks and negative impacts of harmful algal blooms and microcystin pollution on humans, wildlife, fisheries, livestock, pets, and aquatic ecosystems, and develop recommendations for prevention and long-term mitigation. The task force shall submit a summary of its findings based on the review, including its recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Secretary for Environmental Protection, and the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency on or before January 1, 2019.

SECTION 1.
Section 510.5 is added to the
Labor Code
, to read:
510.5.
(a)There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an employee is exempt from Section 510 if the employee earns total gross annual compensation of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and also customarily and regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative, or professional employee as set forth in the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders.
(b)(1)“Total gross annual compensation” shall include at least one thousand dollars ($1,000) per week paid on a salary or fee basis. Total gross annual compensation may also include commissions, nondiscretionary bonuses, and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week period. Total gross annual compensation does not include board, lodging, and other facilities, and does not include payments for medical insurance, paymentsod as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will apply.
(c)The presumption created under subdivision (a) shall be rebutted only by evidence of one or more of the following:
(1)The employee did not earn total gross annual compensation of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
(2)The employee did not earn at least one thousand dollars ($1,000) per week paid on a salary or fee basis.
(3)The employee did not customarily and regularly perform at least one exempt duty or responsibility of an executive, administrative, or professional employee as set forth in the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders.
(d)This section applies only to employees whose primary duty includes performing office or nonmanual work.
(e)(1)This section does not apply to nonmanagement production-line workers and nonmanagement employees in maintenance, construction, and similar occupations, such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers, and other employees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill, and energy, regardless of the amount of their compensation.
(2)This section does not apply to an employee covered under a valid collective bargaining agreement that expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of employees, including premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked.","Existing law establishes the State Coastal Conservancy and prescribes the membership and functions and duties of the conservancy with respect to preservation of coastal resources in the state.
This bill would enact the Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, which would require the State Water Resources Control Board, until January 1, 2020, to establish and coordinate the Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, comprised of specified representatives of state agencies, including the conservancy, in consultation with the Secretary for Environmental Protection, and would prescribe the functions and duties of the task force. The bill would require the task force to review the risks and negative impacts of harmful algal blooms and microcystin pollution and to submit a summary of its findings and recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency, and the secretary on or before January 1, 2019. The act would require the task force, before providing funding recommendations or submitting a summary of findings, to notify the public about ongoing activities and provide opportunities for public review and comment on applied research, projects, and programs. The act would authorize the conservancy, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Wildlife Conservation Board, and the State Water Resources Control Board to enter into contracts and provide grants, upon appropriation, from specified bond funds available under the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, the California Sea Otter Fund, or from other appropriate funds for applied research, projects, and programs, recommended by the task force, aimed at preventing or sustainably mitigating harmful algal blooms, including cyanotoxins and microcystin pollution in the waters of the state.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, establishes 8 hours as a day’s work and a 40-hour workweek, and requires payment of prescribed overtime compensation for additional hours worked. Existing law establishes the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement in the Department of Industrial Relations for the enforcement of labor laws, including overtime payment. Under existing law, a person who violates the provisions regulating work hours is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would establish a rebuttable presumption that an employee is exempt from overtime pay if the employee earns total gross annual compensation of at least $100,000 and regularly performs any of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative, or professional employee as set forth in the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This bill, to rebut the presumption, would require evidence that the employee did not earn total gross annual compensation of at least $100,000, that the employee did not earn at least $1,000 per week, as specified, or that the employee did not regularly perform at least one exempt duty of an executive, administrative, or professional employee. This bill would only apply to an employee whose primary duty includes office or nonmanual work, as described.","An act to add

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California’s climate is changing, posing an escalated threat to public health, the environment, the economy, and public and private property in the state. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, including floods and heat waves, fires, rising sea levels, and changes in hydrology, including diminishing snowpacks and more frequent droughts, among other climate change impacts, will affect every part of residents’ lives in the next century and beyond. Planning appropriately for these impacts will help us be better prepared for the future.
(b) The impacts of climate change, including longer droughts, extended floods, prolonged fire seasons with larger and more intense fires, heat waves, and sea level rise, are already creating challenges for public health and safety and causing destructive property damage.
(c) Climate change poses a threat not just to the lives and health of residents but also to the state’s economy and to the financial health of our local governments.
(d) According to the Natural Resources Agency’s report, “Safeguarding California: Reducing Climate Risk,” state-of-the-art modeling shows that a single extreme winter storm in California could cost on the order of $725,000,000,000, including total direct property losses of nearly $400,000,000,000 and devastating impacts to residents, the economy, and natural resources.
(e) Adapting to climate change, in addition to reducing the impacts of climate change on California’s natural resources and infrastructure, is essential to protecting the state’s environment and economy over time and will require coordination across all state departments and agencies.
(f) Given the potential impacts and the long-term nature of effective planning, California needs to take action now.

(F) Emergency services.
(G) Forestry.
(H) Biodiversity and habitat.
(I) Ocean and coastal resources.
(2) Priority actions needed to reduce risks in those sectors, as identified by the lead agency or group of agencies.
(b) By January 1, 2017, and every three years thereafter, the agency shall release a draft plan. Between the release of the draft plan and the publication of the final update of the plan, the agency shall hold at least three public hearings for the purpose of providing an opportunity for the public to review and provide written and oral comments on the draft plan. The public hearings shall be held in northern California, the central valley of California, and southern California.
(c) The agency shall annually report to the Legislature, consistent with Section 9795 of the Government Code, on actions taken by each applicable agency to implement the plan.
71154.
To address the vulnerabilities identified in the plan, state agencies shall work to maximize, where applicable and feasible, the following objectives:
(a) Educating the public about the consequences of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, the urban heat island effect, habitat loss, wildfire, drought, threats to infrastructure and agriculture, worsening air and water quality, and public health impacts.
(b) Ensuring there is a continued repository for scientific data on climate change and climate adaptation in the state in order to facilitate educated state and local policy decisions and to help identify primary risks from climate change to residents, property, communities, and natural systems across the state.
(c) (1) Promoting the use of the plan to inform planning decisions and ensure that state investments consider climate change impacts, as well as promote the use of natural systems and natural infrastructure, when developing physical infrastructure to address adaptation.
(2) When developing infrastructure to address adaptation, where feasible, a project alternative should be developed that utilizes existing natural features and ecosystem processes or the restoration of natural features and ecosystem processes to meet the project’s goals.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “natural infrastructure” means the preservation or restoration of ecological systems or the utilization of engineered systems that use ecological processes to increase resiliency to climate change, manage other environmental hazards, or both. This may include, but need not be limited to, flood plain and wetlands restoration or preservation, combining levees with restored natural systems to reduce flood risk, and urban tree planting to mitigate high heat days.
(d) Encouraging regional collaborative planning efforts to address regional climate change impacts and adaptation strategies.
(e) Promoting drought resiliency through an integrated water supply, delivery, and capture system that is coordinated and that can be resilient to a multiyear drought scenario while protecting water quality and the public health. Establishing both drought preparation programs, which will help create sustainable water systems in the future, and immediate drought response programs, which will reduce water demand or increase supply within one to five years of any declared drought.
(f) Building resilient communities by developing urban greening projects that reduce air pollution and heat reflection in urban areas and create livable, sustainable communities in urban cores to promote infill development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(g) Protecting and enhancing habitat, species strongholds, and wildlife corridors that are critical to the preservation of species that are at risk from the consequences of climate change.
(h) Promoting actions to ensure healthy soils and sustainable agriculture; inform reliable transportation planning; improve emergency management response across sectors; ensure sufficient, reliable, and safe energy; improve capacity to reduce and respond to public health threats; address the impacts of climate change on disadvantaged communities; and protect cultural resources from the impacts of climate change.

SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) California is home to a large number of military personnel, including 150,000 active duty personnel.
(2) Military families are a unique population with unique circumstances. The children of military families face constant transition, including family mobility and parental deployment.
(3) Military families move more than twice as often as civilian families. Forty percent of officers and 60 percent of enlisted personnel move during the school year. Thus, the lower the rank of the military family member, the more often the family moves.
(4) During a time of war, military families endure the strains of long-term separation as one or both parents may be deployed overseas.
(5) During parental deployment children are often anxious, stressed, and confused. Child care providers and preschools can be places where stability and routine can provide security. The routine helps to cushion the impact of parental deployment.
(6) Early education can be a determining factor in the early academic success of a pupil from a military family by providing educational enrichment, as well as a stable and nurturing learning environment.
(b) Given these special circumstances, it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that military families have access to the child care development services that their children need.

Existing law requires the superintendent of each school district to assign employees employed in positions requiring certification qualifications to positions in which they are to serve, subject to the approval of the governing board of the school district, and authorizes the superintendent of each school district to transfer teachers consistent with the adopted school district policy concerning transfer of teachers from one school to another school within the school district. Existing law requires each school district to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance as it reasonably relates to pupil academic progress, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee’s adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee’s responsibilities.
This bill would prohibit the superintendent of a school district from transferring or assigning a certificated employee with the primary responsibility of being the classroom teacher of record to a schoolsite if the transfer or assignment would result in the reduction of the average effective teacher experience factor at the schoolsite to less than 90% of the average effective teaching experience factor in the school district for schools of the same type, as specified. Notwithstanding that provision, the bill would require the State Board of Education to waive the prohibition upon the request of the governing board of a school district if the governing board of the school district meets certain conditions, including, among others, demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the state board, that the certificated employee subject to transfer or assignment has the appropriate credential necessary to teach a specific course, grade level, or program of study, and there is a critical shortage for certificated employees with such a credential in the local labor market.
The bill also would prohibit a pupil from being knowingly assigned to a classroom where the teacher of record received an unsatisfactory performance rating in the most recent evaluation and assessment of the employee’s job performance unless the employee is actively participating in a California Peer Assistance and Review Program or other specified conditions are met. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to waive the prohibition on an individual basis, as provided.

(d) For purposes of this part, “cure” means that the employer abates each violation alleged by any aggrieved employee, the employer is in compliance with the underlying statutes as specified in the notice required by this part, and any aggrieved employee is made whole. A violation of paragraph (6) or (8) of subdivision (a) of Section 226 shall only be considered cured upon a showing that the employer has provided a fully compliant, itemized wage statement to each aggrieved employee for each pay period for the three-year period prior to the date of the written notice sent pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3.
(e) (1) For purposes of this part, whenever the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has discretion to assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the same discretion, subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a civil penalty.
(2) In any action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.

(1) If, at the time of the alleged violation, the person does not employ one or more employees, the civil penalty is five hundred dollars ($500).
(2) If, at the time of the alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.
(3) If the alleged violation is a failure to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, there shall be no civil penalty.
(g) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty described in subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Nothing in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.
(2) No action shall be brought under this part for any violation of a posting, notice, agency reporting, or filing requirement of this code, except where the filing or reporting requirement involves mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting.
(h) No action may be brought under this section by an aggrieved employee if the agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within the timeframes set forth in Section 2699.3 for a violation of the same section or sections of the Labor Code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or others or initiates a proceeding pursuant to Section 98.3.
(i) Except as provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.
(j) Civil penalties recovered under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) shall be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes.
(k) Nothing contained in this part is intended to alter or otherwise affect the exclusive remedy provided by the workers’ compensation provisions of this code for liability against an employer for the compensation for any injury to or death of an employee arising out of and in the course of employment.
(l) The superior court shall review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed settlement agreement pursuant to this part.
(m) This section shall not apply to the recovery of administrative and civil penalties in connection with the workers’ compensation law as contained in Division 1 (commencing with Section 50) and Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200), including, but not limited to, Sections 129.5 and 132a.
(n) The agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, or agencies may promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this part.

The provisions of the settlement relating to health and safety laws shall be submitted to the division at the same time that they are submitted to the court. This requirement shall be construed to authorize and permit the division to comment on those settlement provisions, and the court shall grant the division’s commentary the appropriate weight.

The agency may grant the employer three additional business days to cure the alleged violation. If the agency determines that the alleged violation has not been cured or if the agency fails to provide timely or any notification, the employee may proceed with the civil action pursuant to Section 2699. If the agency determines that the alleged violation has been cured, but the employee still disagrees, the employee may appeal that determination to the superior court.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to incentivize prompt resolution of disputes over itemized wage statements under Part 13 (commencing with Section 2698) of Division 2 of the Labor Code arising from certain specified claims under Section 226 of the Labor Code, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to recover specified civil penalties, that would otherwise be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, on behalf of the employee and other current or former employees for the violation of certain provisions affecting employees. The act provides the employer with the right to cure certain violations before the employee may bring a civil action, as specified. For other violations, the act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.
Existing law requires an employer to provide its employees with specified information regarding their wages, including, among others, the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid and the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer, either semimonthly or at the time of each wage payment and provides that the employer does not have the right to cure a violation of that requirement before an employee may bring a civil action under the act.
This bill would provide an employer with the right to cure a violation of the requirement that an employer provide its employees with the inclusive dates of the pay period and the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer before an employee may bring a civil action under the act. The bill would provide that a violation of that requirement shall only be considered cured upon a showing that the employer has provided a fully compliant, itemized wage statement to each aggrieved employee, as specified. The bill would limit the employer’s right to cure with respect to alleged violations of these provisions to once in a 12-month period, as specified. The bill would also delete references to obsolete provisions of law.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 2699, 2699.3, and 2699.5 of the Labor Code, relating to employment, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

(3) Except as provided in subdivision (b), expenditures that shall count toward the minimum percentage of funds shall include only training services as defined in Section 3174(c)(3)(D) of Title 29 of the United States Code and the corresponding sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, including all of the following:

This credit may be applied toward the minimum training requirements in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a).
(A) Leveraged funds that may be applied toward the credit allowed by this subdivision shall include the following:
(i) Federal Pell Grants established under Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1070 et seq.).

(xii) With the approval of the state board, any other public or private funds source not identified in this subparagraph that is used to provide training or supportive services for individuals who are also enrolled in training provided the individuals receiving the relevant services are enrolled in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 for performance reporting and tracking purposes.
(B) Credit for leveraged funds shall only be given if the local workforce development board keeps records of all training and supportive services expenditures it chooses to apply to the credit. Training and supportive services expenditures may only be applied to the credit if the relevant costs can be independently verified by the Employment Development Department and, without exception, training participants must be coenrolled in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 performance monitoring system.
(2) The use of leveraged funds to partially meet the training requirements specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) is the prerogative of a local workforce development board. Costs arising from the recordkeeping required to demonstrate compliance with the leveraging requirements of this subdivision are the responsibility of the local board.
(c) Beginning program year 2012, the Employment Development Department shall calculate for each local workforce development board, within six months after the end of the second program year of the two-year period of availability for expenditure of federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 funds, whether the local workforce development board met the requirements of subdivision (a). The Employment Development Department shall provide to each local workforce development board its individual calculations with respect to the expenditure requirements of subdivision (a).
(d) A local workforce development area that does not meet the requirements of subdivision (a) shall submit a corrective action plan to the Employment Development Department that provides reasons for not meeting the requirements and describes actions taken to address the identified expenditure deficiencies. A local workforce development area shall provide a corrective action plan to the Employment Development Department pursuant to this section within 90 days of receiving the calculations described in subdivision (c).
(e) For the purpose of this section, “program year” has the same meaning as provided in Section 667.100 of Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
Making these changes to the training mandate immediately ensures that they are enacted before the local workforce development boards are required to submit their local and regional plans, due March 2017. Timely submission of these plans is critical to the provision of services that provide access to job, skill development, and business services vital to the social and economic well-being of communities in the state.","The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 provides for workforce investment activities, including activities in which states may participate. Existing law contains various programs for job training and employment investment, including work incentive programs, as specified, and establishes local workforce investment boards to perform duties related to the implementation and coordination of local workforce investment activities. Existing law requires local workforce investment boards to spend a minimum percentage of specified funds for adults and dislocated workers on federally identified workforce training programs and allows the boards to leverage specified funds to meet the funding requirements, as specified. Existing law authorizes a credit of up to 10% of that funding minimum for leveraged funds, which include Pell Grants and employment training panel grants.
This bill would expand the types of services to which leveraged funds may be applied to include supportive services and would expand the types of leveraged funds that may be applied to the 10% credit, described above, to include specified federal, local, state, and private funds.

(b) An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the employee disclosed or may disclose information, to a government or law enforcement agency, to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or for providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties.

(1) Made any oral or written complaint to the division, other governmental agencies having statutory responsibility for or assisting the division with reference to employee safety or health, his or her employer, or his or her representative.
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or relating to his or her rights or has testified or is about to testify in the proceeding or because of the exercise by the employee on behalf of himself, herself, or others of any rights afforded him or her.
(3) Participated in an occupational health and safety committee established pursuant to Section 6401.7.
(b) Any employee who is discharged, threatened with discharge, demoted, suspended, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because the employee has made a bona fide oral or written complaint to the division, other governmental agencies having statutory responsibility for or assisting the division with reference to employee safety or health, his or her employer, or his or her representative, of unsafe working conditions, or work practices, in his or her employment or place of employment, or has participated in an employer-employee occupational health and safety committee, shall be entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer. Any employer who willfully refuses to rehire, promote, or otherwise restore an employee or former employee who has been determined to be eligible for rehiring or promotion by a grievance procedure, arbitration, or hearing authorized by law, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(c) An employer, or a person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee because the employee is a family member of a person who has, or is perceived to have, engaged in any acts protected by this section.
(d) For purposes of this section, “employer” or “a person acting on behalf of the employer” includes, but is not limited to, a client employer as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 2810.3 and an employer listed in subdivision (b) of Section 6400.","(1) Existing law prohibits an employer from discharging an employee or in any manner discriminating, retaliating, or taking any adverse action against any employee or applicant for employment because the employee or applicant has engaged in protected conduct, as specified. Existing law provides that an employee who made a bona fide complaint, and was consequently discharged or otherwise suffered an adverse action, is entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to willfully refuse to reinstate or otherwise restore an employee who is determined by a specified procedure to be eligible for reinstatement. Existing law subjects a person who violates these provisions to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation.
This bill would extend the protections of these provisions, as specified, to an employee who is a family member of a person who engaged in, or was perceived to engage in, the protected conduct or make a complaint protected by these provisions. This bill would define terms for the purpose of these provisions.
(2) Existing law requires a client employer to share with a labor contractor all civil legal responsibility and civil liability for all workers supplied by that labor contractor for the payment of wages and the failure to obtain valid workers’ compensation coverage. Existing law also prohibits a client employer from shifting to the labor contractor legal duties or liabilities under workplace safety provisions with respect to workers provided by the labor contractor. Existing law defines terms for these purposes and authorizes the Labor Commissioner to adopt regulations and rules of practice and procedure necessary to administer and enforce these provisions. Existing law excludes certain types of employers from these provisions, including, but not limited to, a client employer that is not a motor carrier of property based solely on the employer’s use of a third-party motor carrier of property with interstate or intrastate operating authority to ship or receive freight, and a client employer that is a motor carrier of property subcontracting with, or otherwise engaging, another motor carrier of property to provide transportation services using its own employees and commercial motor vehicles.
The Household Goods Carriers Act subjects household goods carriers to the jurisdiction and control of the Public Utilities Commission. The act prohibits a household goods carrier from engaging, or attempting to engage, in the business of the transportation of used household goods and personal effects by motor vehicle over any public highway in the state without a permit issued by the commission authorizing transportation entirely within the state, or a valid operating authority issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for interstate transportation.
This bill would expand the types of employers excluded from those labor contracting provisions to include a client employer that is not a household goods carrier based solely on the employer’s use of a third-party household goods carrier permitted by the commission to move household goods, and a client employer that is a permitted household goods carrier subcontracting with, or otherwise engaging, another permitted household goods carrier to provide transportation of household goods using its own employees and motor vehicles.","An act to amend Sections 98.6, 1102.5, 2810.3, and 6310 of the Labor Code, relating to employment."

SECTION 1.
Section 396 of the Insurance Code is amended to read:
396.
(a) An insurer shall do either of the following:
(1) Maintain a verifiable process that allows a policyholder to designate in writing or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 38.5 one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of a policy for nonpayment of premium. The insurer shall notify the policyholder in writing or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 38.5 of this right at the time of the application or within 30 days after the inception date of an individual policy described in subdivision (f), and at least every two years thereafter. The notification described in this subdivision shall instruct the policyholder how to request the designation and how to replace or delete a designee. If a policyholder initiates contact with the insurer after the insurer has provided notice and the insurer complies with the policyholder’s request to establish or change the additional person to receive the notice described in this section, the insurer shall not be required to maintain additional verification.
(2) Comply with subdivision (b).
(b) An insurer that adopts the following procedure shall be deemed to have complied with subdivision (a).
(1) Unless an applicant for insurance has been provided notice of the right set forth in this section prior to inception of the policy, the insurer shall provide the policyholder, within 30 days after the inception date of an individual policy described in subdivision (f), with notice of the right to designate one person, in addition to the policyholder, to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of a policy for nonpayment of premium. The insurer shall provide each applicant or policyholder with notice in writing or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 38.5 of the opportunity to make the designation. That notice shall instruct the applicant or policyholder on how he or she is to submit the name and address of one person, in addition to the applicant or policyholder, who is to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium.
(2) If after having been provided notice from the insurer of the right to designate an individual to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium, the applicant or policyholder fails to designate an individual within 30 days, the applicant or policyholder shall be conclusively presumed to have declined the opportunity to exercise his or her right at that time.
(3) Notwithstanding subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 791.13 or any other law, the insurer shall retain and utilize as necessary the contact information provided in the written designation for the lifetime of the policy, and allow the policyholder to update the written designation if the policyholder so requests.
(c) (1) A policyholder retains the right to designate the one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium at any time, at the initiative of the policyholder, regardless of whether the policyholder previously declined to exercise that right. At least every two years, the insurer shall notify the policyholder in writing or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 38.5, of whichever of the following applies:
(A) If a policyholder has previously provided a designation pursuant to this subdivision, in writing or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 38.5, the right to change the prior designation by replacing or deleting a person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium.
(B) If the policyholder has not previously designated a person to receive the notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium pursuant to this subdivision, the right to designate a person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium.
(2) The notice requirements in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) may be provided to a policyholder in a single notice and shall not require two separate notices.
(d) When a policyholder pays the premium for an insurance policy through a payroll or pension deduction plan, the requirements contained in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) need not be met until 60 days after the policyholder is no longer on that deduction payment plan.
(e) An insurance policy shall not lapse or be terminated for nonpayment of premium unless the insurer, at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation, gives notice to the individual designated pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) at the address provided by the policyholder for purposes of receiving the notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium. Notwithstanding any other law, notice shall be given by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, within 10 days after the premium is due and unpaid. This subdivision does not modify requirements for notice to the policyholder of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation set forth in other sections of this code.
(f) This section applies only to policies of private passenger automobile insurance that provide coverage for six months or longer, policies of residential property insurance as described in subdivision (a) of Section 10087 that take effect or that are renewed after the effective date of this section, and policies of individual disability income insurance as described in subdivision (i) of Section 799.01, except if the premiums for the individual disability income policy are paid entirely by the employer.
(g) This section applies to policies that are issued and take effect or that are renewed on or after January 1, 2016.
(h) An individual designated by a policyholder pursuant to this section to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium does not have any rights, whether as an additional insured or otherwise, to any benefits under the policy, other than the right to receive notice as provided by this section.
(i) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2016.","Existing law requires an insurance policy to specify certain information, including, but not limited to, the parties to the contract, the property or life insured, the risks insured against, premium, and the coverage period. Existing law, commencing January 1, 2016, and with regard to private passenger automobile insurance that provides coverage for 6 months or longer, specified residential property insurance, and policies of individual disability income insurance that are issued and take effect or that are renewed on or after January 1, 2016, requires an insurer to maintain a verifiable process or adopt a procedure that allows an applicant or policyholder to designate one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of a policy for nonpayment of premium, as specified. Existing law provides that if an insurer opts to adopt the verifiable process, then the insurer, shall provide the policyholder, within 30 days after the inception of an individual policy, with notice of the right to designate one person. Existing law provides that if a policyholder pays the premium for an insurance policy through a payroll or pension deduction plan, then the notice of the right to designate one person need only be sent within 60 days after the policyholder is no longer on that deduction payment plan. Existing law further requires the application form for an insurance policy to clearly indicate the deduction payment plan selected by the applicant.
This bill would delete the requirement that the application form clearly indicate the deduction payment plan selected by the applicant. The bill would make these provisions inapplicable to a policy of disability income insurance if the premiums for the policy are paid entirely by the employer.","An act to amend Section 396 of the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."

The report shall do all of the following:
(a) Provide a strategic information technology plan that describes the long-term goals and strategies which shall be undertaken by the department to create an information technology environment that will not only support the achievement of the department’s strategic business mission and goals but set the foundation for using information technology to make substantial and sustainable improvements in how it conducts business. The plan shall cover a 10-year planning horizon and include the department’s information vision, its information management principles, and long-term goals and strategies for achieving its information vision.
(b) Provide a tactical information plan of specific automation and infrastructure projects to be undertaken within three years of the date of the report.

(3) The costs and benefits identified in the report are consistent with the projects previously submitted for approval or contained in the Information Management Annual Plans.","Existing law provides unemployment compensation benefits to eligible persons who are unemployed through no fault of their own.

Existing law sets forth the eligibility criteria for the program, including that the individual is a journey level union member and the training or retraining course of instruction is industry-related training necessary due to changes in technology, or industry demands, or is necessary to retain employment or to become more competitive in obtaining employment.
This bill would recast these provisions to permit eligibility for a member of a union or trade association, a participant in training sponsored by an employer, or an individual who is a participant in a state or federally approved apprenticeship program.
Existing law sets the maximum benefit amount under the program at 52 times the weekly benefit amount, including the maximum award under the parent compensation claim, as defined, and requires that benefits received under any federal unemployment compensation law be included as benefits payable under these provisions.
This bill recast those provisions to set forth certain federally funded unemployment benefits to be included within these benefits. Because the bill would make changes to existing eligibility requirements for training and benefits, which would result in additional amounts being payable from the Unemployment Fund for those benefits, the bill would make an appropriation.
This bill would make changes to delete references to the repealed federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and instead refer to the successor federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
Existing law requires the Director of Employment Development to report to the Legislature by June 30 of each year on the Employment Development Department’s fraud deterrence and detection activities.
This bill would instead require the report to be made to specified committees of the Legislature.
Existing law requires the director to prepare and report to specified committees of the Legislature and the State Office of Information Technology on the department’s automation plans, including recommendations on improvements and long-term goals and strategies.

Examinations shall be prepared by the board with the advice and assistance of a committee of five assessors selected by the California Assessors’ Association for this purpose. A certificate shall not be issued to any assessor or person employed by the office of the county assessor who has not attained a passing grade in the examination and demonstrated to the board that he or she is competent to make change in ownership or exemption decisions, or both, as that competency is defined in regulations duly adopted by the board. However, any applicant for a certificate who is denied a certificate pursuant to this section shall have a right to a review of that denial in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

(2) Any training time in excess of the 24-hour minimum that is accumulated in any one year shall be carried over as credit for future training requirements, with a limit of three years in which the carryover time may be credited.
(3) Failure to complete training in accordance with this subdivision shall constitute grounds for revocation of a certificate. A proceeding to revoke shall be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(4) Training shall include, but not be limited to, new developments in applicable case law, statutory law, and administrative rules.

677.
The board may issue a temporary certificate to an assessor who is newly elected or appointed or to any person newly employed by the office of the county assessor in order to afford the person the opportunity to apply for and take an examination, the successful passage of which would qualify the person for a certificate pursuant to this article. The board shall not issue a temporary certificate for a duration that exceeds one year, unless the person has been duly elected or appointed to the office of assessor. The board shall not renew a temporary certificate.
678.
The board may issue an interim certificate to a current assessor or to any person who is currently employed by the office of the county assessor, and who is making change in ownership or exemption decisions in order to afford that person the opportunity to apply for and take an examination, the successful passage of which would qualify the person for a certificate pursuant to this article.

680.
This article shall only apply in counties or cities and counties that have passed a resolution upon the recommendation of the assessor to require certification as provided by this article.","Existing law provides for the annual assessment and collection of property taxes by each county, and provides for the state administration of the property tax by the State Board of Equalization.
The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, “full cash value” is defined as the assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred.
Existing property tax law requires a transferee of real property or a manufactured home that is locally assessed to file a change in ownership statement with the assessor of the county in which the property or manufactured home is located, and also requires a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity to file a change in ownership statement with the board.
Existing property tax law also includes various property tax exemptions as authorized or established by the California Constitution.
This bill would prohibit an assessor or any person employed by the office of the county assessor from making decisions with regard to change in ownership, or with regard to property tax exemptions, except a homeowners’ exemption claim, unless he or she is the holder of a valid assessment analyst certificate issued by the board. The bill would require the board to provide for the examination of applicants for a certificate and would authorize the board to contract with the Department of Human Resources to give the examinations. The bill would require prescribed annual training for certification, and would also provide for advanced certification. Failure to complete training as required would be grounds for revocation. The bill would also authorize the board to issue temporary certificates and interim certificates under prescribed circumstances. This bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to impede assessors from managing their staff resources efficiently regarding exemption applications and change in ownership documents, provided that noncertificated staff are not responsible for making exemption or change in ownership decisions. This bill would provide that its provisions only apply in those counties and cities and counties that have passed a resolution upon the recommendation of the assessor to require certification as described above.","An act to amend and renumber Section 674 of, and to add Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 674) to Chapter 3 of Part 2 of Division 1 of, the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

(a) The State Registrar, in consultation with the County Recorders’ Association of California and other stakeholders, shall study all security features for paper used to print a vital record pursuant to Section 103525, or alternative security features that are equal to or better than those that are currently mandated.
(b) (1) On or before January 1, 2018, the State Registrar shall submit to the Legislature a report that contains the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision (a) and legislative recommendations pertaining to those findings.
(2) A report submitted to the Legislature pursuant to this subdivision shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order for the State Registrar to allow individuals access to their vital records and to conduct a study regarding all security features for paper used to print a vital record, or alternative security features that are equal to or better than those that are currently mandated, as soon as possible, and to ensure timely reporting of the findings of that study to the Legislature, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law requires the State Registrar to administer the registration of births, deaths, fetal deaths, and marriages. Existing law requires the State Registrar to arrange and permanently preserve the certificates in a systematic manner and to prepare and maintain a comprehensive and continuous index of all certificates registered. Existing law requires that specified birth, death, and marriage record indices prepared or maintained by local registrars and county recorders be kept confidential. Existing law requires, notwithstanding these provisions, local registrars and county recorders to release, when requested, their comprehensive birth, death, and nonconfidential marriage record indices to the State Registrar.
This bill would additionally authorize the local registrar to release birth and death record indices to the county recorder within its jurisdiction for purposes of the preparation or maintenance of the indices of the county recorder. The bill would extend application of specified access restrictions applicable to confidential portions of certificates of live birth to confidential birth record indices.
Existing law prescribes specified personal information to be included on birth, death, and marriage certificates. Under existing law, a certified copy of a birth or death record may only be supplied by the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder to an authorized person, as defined, who submits a statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the applicant is an authorized person. Existing law also requires that each certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record contain specified information and be printed on sensitized security paper with specified security features, including, among others, intaglio print.
This bill would authorize the State Registrar to suspend the use of any security feature if necessary to enable the State Registrar, local registrar, county recorder, or county clerk to supply an applicant with a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record. The bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to implement this provision through all-county letters or similar instructions, as specified.
Existing law requires the State Registrar to appoint a Vital Records Protection Advisory Committee to study and make recommendations to protect individual privacy, inhibit identity theft, and prevent fraud involving birth, death, and marriage certificates while providing needed access to the information contained in those records by persons seeking it for a legitimate purpose.
This bill would require the State Registrar, in consultation with the County Recorders’ Association of California and other stakeholders, to study all security features for paper used to print a vital record, or alternative security features that are equal to or better than those that are currently mandated. The bill would require the State Registrar to submit a report to the Legislature, on or before January 1, 2018, that contains the findings of that study and legislative recommendations pertaining to those findings.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 102230 and 103526.5 of, and to add Section 103526.6 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to vital records, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

31010.
(a) The board shall administer and collect the tax imposed by this part pursuant to the Fee Collection Procedures Law (Part 30 (commencing with Section 55001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) with those changes as may be necessary to conform to this section.

Funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be allocated on a competitive grant application process administered by the Department of Food and Agriculture. The Department of Food and Agriculture shall promulgate guidelines for the grant process as soon as administratively possible, but no later than April 1, 2017.
(2) Thirty-five percent to the Natural Resources Agency to fund a competitive grant program for environmental cleanup restoration, and protection of public and private lands that have been damaged by illegal marijuana cultivation. Where appropriate, the agency may administer funds using programs established pursuant to Section 5750 of the Public Resources Code, subdivision (a) and paragraph (1) of subdivision (l) of Section 75050 of the Public Resources Code.

SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use and cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law makes it a crime to plant, cultivate, harvest, dry, or process marijuana, except as otherwise authorized by law. Under existing law, qualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards, who associate in order collectively and cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, are not subject to criminal sanctions solely on the basis of that fact.
The Fee Collection Procedures Law, among other things, provides for the administration of fee programs by the State Board of Equalization, establishes procedures for collection, reporting, return, refund, and appeals, and authorizes the board to adopt regulations relating to administration and enforcement of the law. The Fee Collection Procedures Law establishes criminal penalties for specified acts, including making it a misdemeanor to knowingly or willfully file a false return and making it a felony to willfully evade or attempt to evade or defeat the payment of a fee.
This bill would impose a tax in specified amounts on the distribution in this state by a cultivator, as defined, of marijuana flowers, marijuana leaves, and immature marijuana plants to a licensed distributor, as specified, and would require the licensed distributor to collect the tax from the cultivator and remit it to the board. The bill would require the board to collect the tax pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Fee Collection Procedures Law. The bill would require all moneys, less refunds and costs of administration, to be deposited into the Marijuana Production and Environment Mitigation Fund, which this bill would establish in the State Treasury, and would continuously appropriate the moneys in that fund to the board for allocation, as specified.
By expanding the application of the Fee Collection Procedures Law, which imposes criminal penalties for various acts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3
of the membership of each house of the Legislature.","An act to add Part 13.5 (commencing with Section 31001) to Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to medical marijuana, and making an appropriation therefor."

(a) The United States and Israel have a unique bond based on their shared, enduring values, which are reflected in the virtues and principles of freedom and democracy, and have stood together as allies since Israel was first formed as a nation.
(b) For years, California and Israel have established business partnerships and trade relations with each other, and those partnerships have helped enhance the agricultural, educational, energy, entertainment, health, medical, scientific, and water policies in California, Israel, and the United States.
(c) On March 5, 2014, as the culmination of an effort started as Assembly Bill 1032 of the 2009–10 Regular Session, the Governor of California and the Prime Minister of Israel signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for strategic partnerships for joint innovation, exchanges, and cooperation between California and Israel.
(d) In July 2015, the Legislature affirmed its support for the MOU by passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 25, noting that participants in the MOU had already expanded cooperation between Israel and California in areas such as alternative energy, agriculture, business innovation, and academia, and declaring that collaboration with Israel will foster peace and democracy in the Middle East.
(e) Public retirement systems in this state currently invest on behalf of the citizens of California in publicly traded foreign companies that may be at risk due to ties with businesses that are publicly boycotting Israel.
(f) Investments in publicly traded foreign companies that have business operations with a company that boycotts Israel risk the pensions of the dedicated public employees of this state.
(g) Excluding and divesting from companies that boycott Israel and from portfolios that include those companies will help protect the public retirement systems in this state from investment losses related to these business activities and may improve the investment performance of the public retirement systems.
(h) Israel is recognized around the world as the strongest democratically elected government in the Middle East and is an American ally, and that nation’s democracy and relationship with the United States add to the security and strength of California.
(i) It is unconscionable for this state to invest in companies that boycott Israel, as California has long standing social, political, and economic partnerships with the State of Israel.

This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to allow ABLE accounts to be accessed at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing federal law, the Stephen Beck, Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (ABLE Act), encourages and assists individuals and families to save private funds for the purpose of supporting persons with disabilities to maintain their health, independence, and quality of life by excluding from gross income distributions used for qualified disability expenses by a beneficiary of a qualified ABLE program established and maintained by a state, as specified.
Existing law conforms to these federal income tax law provisions relating to the ABLE Act under the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, as provided. Existing law defines “eligible individual” for these purposes. Existing law establishes in state government the ABLE program trust for purposes of implementing the federal ABLE Act. Existing law also establishes the ABLE Act Board and authorizes the board to adopt regulations to implement the program.
The existing State Contract Act, in connection with contracts entered into by any state agency for services to be rendered to the state, prohibits a person, firm, or subsidiary thereof that has been awarded a consulting services contract from submitting a bid for, or being awarded a contract for, the provision of services, the procurement of goods or supplies, or any other related action that is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of the consulting services contract. A willful violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor, under other provisions.
This bill would modify the definition of “eligible individual.” The bill would also exempt the ABLE Act Board from the above prohibition in the State Contract Act for a contract with a program consultant for the qualified ABLE program but would require such a contract to be publicly disclosed in a manner specified by the board prior to entering into the contract.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 4875 and 4877 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to taxation, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

Existing law defines the term “collectible” to mean an autographed sports item, as specified, sold or offered for sale in or from this state by a dealer to a consumer for $5 or more. Existing law defines a “dealer” as, among other things, a person who is in the business of selling or offering for sale collectibles in or from this state, or a person who by his or her occupation holds himself or herself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to collectibles.
Existing law provides for the regulation of pawnbrokers and makes it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of a pawnbroker without a license issued by the chief of police, the sheriff, or where appropriate, the police commission.
This bill would instead define the term “collectible” to mean all autographed items, whether or not sports related, as specified, and would make conforming changes to the provisions regulating the sale or offer to sell by a dealer to a consumer of a collectible in this state. The bill would exclude a pawnbroker licensed pursuant to a specified law, under specified circumstances, the personality who signs the memorabilia, and a provider or operator of an online marketplace, as specified, from the definition of a dealer.","An act to amend Section 1739.7 of, and to amend the heading of Title 1.1A (commencing with Section 1739.7) of Part 4 of Division 3 of, and to amend Section 1739.7 of, the Civil Code, relating to collectibles."

(b) In determining whether to refer a person, who is ordered to participate in a program pursuant to Section 668 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, in a licensed alcohol and other drug education and counseling services program pursuant to Section 23538 of the Vehicle Code, or, pursuant to Section 23542, 23548, 23552, 23556, 23562, or 23568 of the Vehicle Code, in a licensed 18-month or 30-month program, the court may consider any relevant information about the person made available pursuant to a presentence investigation, that is permitted but not required under Section 23655 of the Vehicle Code, or other screening procedure. That information shall not be furnished, however, by any person who also provides services in a privately operated, licensed program or who has any direct interest in a privately operated, licensed program. In addition, the court shall obtain from the Department of Motor Vehicles a copy of the person’s driving record to determine whether the person is eligible to participate in a licensed 18-month or 30-month program pursuant to this chapter. When preparing a presentence report for the court, the probation department may consider the suitability of placing the defendant in a treatment program that includes the administration of nonscheduled nonaddicting medications to ameliorate an alcohol or controlled substance problem. If the probation department recommends that this type of program is a suitable option for the defendant, the defendant who would like the court to consider this option shall obtain from his or her physician a prescription for the medication, and a finding that the treatment is medically suitable for the defendant, prior to consideration of this alternative by the court.
(c) (1) The court shall, as a condition of probation pursuant to Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code, refer a first offender whose concentration of alcohol in his or her blood was less than 0.20 percent, by weight, to participate for at least three months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 30 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in this chapter.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in granting probation to a first offender described in this subdivision whose concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood was 0.20 percent or more, by weight, or who refused to take a chemical test, the court shall order the person to participate, for at least nine months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 60 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in this chapter.
(d) (1) The State Department of Health Care Services may specify in regulations the activities required to be provided in the treatment of participants receiving nine months of licensed program services under Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code.
(2) Any program licensed pursuant to this chapter may provide treatment services to participants receiving at least six months of licensed program services under Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code.

(f) The clerk of the court shall indicate the duration of the program in which the judge has ordered the person to participate in the abstract of the record of the court and on the court referral and tracking documents forwarded to the department.
SEC. 2.
Section 23538 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
23538.
(a) (1) If the court grants probation to a person punished under Section 23536, in addition to the provisions of Section 23600 and any other terms and conditions imposed by the court, the court shall impose as a condition of probation that the person pay a fine of at least three hundred ninety dollars ($390), but not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). The court may also impose, as a condition of probation, that the person be confined in a county jail for at least 48 hours, but not more than six months.
(2) The person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle shall be suspended by the department under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 13352 or Section 13352.1. The court shall require the person to surrender the driver’s license to the court in accordance with Section 13550.
(3) Whenever, when considering the circumstances taken as a whole, the court determines that the person punished under this section would present a traffic safety or public safety risk if authorized to operate a motor vehicle during the period of suspension imposed under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 13352 or Section 13352.1, the court may disallow the issuance of a restricted driver’s license required under Section 13352.4.
(b) In any county where the board of supervisors has approved, and the State Department of Health Care Services has licensed, a program or programs described in Section 11837.3 of the Health and Safety Code, the court shall also impose as a condition of probation that the driver shall enroll and participate in, and successfully complete a driving-under-the-influence program, licensed pursuant to Section 11836 of the Health and Safety Code, in the driver’s county of residence or employment, as designated by the court. For the purposes of this subdivision, enrollment in an approved program shall take place within 30 days of conviction and participation in, and completion of, the program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation. Credit may not be given for any program activities completed prior to the date of the current violation. If a person is unable to enroll in a program within 30 days of conviction, the court may grant that person an extension of no longer than 30 days upon the request of the program provider. Extensions may be requested or granted by telephone or by other electronic means.
(1) The court shall refer a first offender whose blood-alcohol concentration was less than 0.20 percent, by weight, to participate for at least three months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 30 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 11836) of Part 2 of Division 10.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
(2) The court shall refer a first offender whose blood-alcohol concentration was 0.20 percent or more, by weight, or who refused to take a chemical test to participate for at least nine months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 60 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 11836) of Part 2 of Division 10.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
(3) The court shall consider, for first time offenders, a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more, by weight, in combination with the presence of a Schedule I or II controlled substance, as defined in Section 812 of Chapter 13 of Title 21 of the United States Code,
except marijuana, as defined in paragraph (16) of Section 802 of Title 21 of the United States Code, or a controlled substance prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist,
as an aggravating factor that may justify enhancing the terms and conditions of probation with regards to referrals and participation in licensed programs and program activities described in Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 11836) of Part 2 of Division 10.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
(4) The court shall advise the person at the time of sentencing that the driving privilege shall not be restored until proof satisfactory to the department of successful completion of a driving-under-the-influence program of the length required under this code that is licensed pursuant to Section 11836 of the Health and Safety Code has been received in the department’s headquarters.
(c) (1) The court shall revoke the person’s probation pursuant to Section 23602, except for good cause shown, for the failure to enroll in, participate in, or complete a program specified in subdivision (b).
(2) The court, in establishing reporting requirements, shall consult with the county alcohol program administrator. The county alcohol program administrator shall coordinate the reporting requirements and court referral and tracking documents with the department and with the State Department of Health Care Services. That reporting shall ensure that all persons who, after being ordered to attend and complete a program, may be identified for either (A) failure to enroll in, or failure to successfully complete, the program, or (B) successful completion of the program as ordered.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires the court to impose as a condition of probation for a conviction for a first violation of driving under the influence, in a county where the board of supervisors has approved, and the State Department of Health Care Services has licensed, a driving-under-the-influence program, that the driver successfully complete the program in the driver’s county of residence or employment, as designated by the court. Existing law provides that enrollment and participation in, and completion of, an approved program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation. Existing law requires a county alcohol program administrator to coordinate court-established reporting requirements with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Department of Health Care Services.
This bill would require that enrollment in an approved program take place within 30 days of conviction, unless an extension of no longer than 30 days is granted by the court, as specified. The bill would also require the court, for first time offenders, to consider a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more, by weight, in combination with the presence of a Schedule I or II controlled substance, as defined,
except for marijuana or a controlled substance prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist,
as an aggravating factor that may justify enhancing the terms and conditions of probation, as specified. The bill would require the county alcohol program administrator to additionally coordinate court referral and tracking documents with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Department of Health Care Services. By imposing new duties on a county employee, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes a court, as a condition of probation, to refer a person convicted for driving under the influence to a licensed program, as specified, even though the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle is restricted, suspended, or revoked. Existing law requires a clerk of the court to indicate the duration of the treatment program the judge has ordered a person to participate in the abstract of the court record that is forwarded to the State Department of Health Care Services.
This bill would instead require a court to refer a person with a 2nd or subsequent
driving under the influence
driving-under-the-influence
conviction to a licensed program as a condition of probation even if the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle is restricted, suspended, or revoked. The bill would require the clerk of the court to also indicate the duration of the treatment program ordered on court referral and tracking documents.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 11837 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 23538 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles."

12201.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (d) or (g), the payment schedules set forth in Section 12200 shall be adjusted annually to reflect any increases or decreases in the cost of living. Except as provided in subdivision (e) or (f), these adjustments shall become effective January 1 of each year. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be based on the changes in the California Necessities Index, which as used in this section shall be the weighted average of changes for food, clothing, fuel, utilities, rent, and transportation for low-income consumers. The computation of annual adjustments in the California Necessities Index shall be made in accordance with the following steps:
(1) The base period expenditure amounts for each expenditure category within the California Necessities Index used to compute the annual grant adjustment are:
Food ........................
$ 3,027
Clothing (apparel and upkeep) ........................
406
Fuel and other utilities ........................
529
Rent, residential ........................
4,883
Transportation ........................
1,757
Total ........................
$10,602
(2) Based on the appropriate components of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage change shall be determined for the 12-month period that ends 12 months prior to the January in which the cost-of-living adjustment will take effect, for each expenditure category specified in paragraph (1) within the following geographical areas: Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, San Francisco-Oakland, San Diego, and, to the extent statistically valid information is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, additional geographical areas within the state that include not less than 80 percent of recipients of aid under this chapter.
(3) Calculate a weighted percentage change for each of the expenditure categories specified in paragraph (1) using the applicable weighting factors for each area used by the Department of Industrial Relations to calculate the California Consumer Price Index (CCPI).
(4) Calculate a category adjustment factor for each expenditure category in paragraph (1) by (1) adding 100 to the applicable weighted percentage change as determined in paragraph (2) and (2) dividing the sum by 100.
(5) Determine the expenditure amounts for the current year by multiplying each expenditure amount determined for the prior year by the applicable category adjustment factor determined in paragraph (4).
(6) Determine the overall adjustment factor by dividing (1) the sum of the expenditure amounts as determined in paragraph (4) for the current year by (2) the sum of the expenditure amounts as determined in paragraph (4) for the prior year.
(b) The overall adjustment factor determined by the preceding computational steps shall be multiplied by the payment schedules established pursuant to Section 12200 as are in effect during the month of December preceding the calendar year in which the adjustments are to occur, and the product rounded to the nearest dollar. The resultant amounts shall constitute the new schedules for the categories given under subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of Section 12200, and shall be filed with the Secretary of State. The amount as set forth in subdivision (h) of Section 12200 shall be adjusted annually pursuant to this section in the event that the secretary agrees to administer payment under that subdivision. The payment schedule for subdivision (i) of Section 12200 shall be computed as specified, based on the new payment schedules for subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Section 12200.
(c) The department shall adjust any amounts of aid under this chapter to ensure that the minimum level required by the Social Security Act in order to maintain eligibility for funds under Title XIX of that act is met.
(d) (1) No adjustment shall be made under this section for the 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 calendar years to reflect any change in the cost of living. Elimination of the cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the requirements of Section 12201.05, and no further reduction shall be made pursuant to that section.
(2) Any cost-of-living adjustment granted under this section for any calendar year shall not include adjustments for any calendar year in which the cost-of-living adjustment was suspended pursuant to paragraph (1).
(e) For the 2003 calendar year, the adjustment required by this section shall become effective June 1, 2003.
(f) For the 2005 calendar year, the adjustment required by this section shall become effective April 1, 2005.
(g) (1) For the 2011 calendar year to the 2017 calendar year, inclusive, no adjustment shall be made under this section unless otherwise specified by statute.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the pass along of federal benefits provided for in Section 12201.05 shall be effective on January 1 of each calendar year.","Existing law provides for the State Supplementary Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (SSP), which requires the State Department of Social Services to contract with the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments to SSP recipients to supplement Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments made available pursuant to the federal Social Security Act.
Under existing law, benefit payments under SSP are calculated by establishing the maximum level of nonexempt income and federal SSI and state SSP benefits for each category of eligible recipient. The state SSP payment is the amount required, when added to the nonexempt income and SSI benefits available to the recipient, to provide the maximum benefit payment. Existing law prohibits, for each calendar year, commencing with the 2011 calendar year, any cost-of-living adjustment from being made to the maximum benefit payment unless otherwise specified by statute, except for the pass along of any cost-of-living increase in the federal SSI benefits. Existing law continuously appropriates funds for the implementation of SSP.

(b) A change in ownership of the property comprising the GoMentum Station shall not affect the authorization to conduct testing pursuant to this section.
(c) Prior to the start of the testing of an autonomous vehicle that does not have a driver seated in the driver’s seat on or across a public road, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority or a private entity, or a combination of the two, shall do both of the following:
(1) Obtain an instrument of insurance, surety bond, or proof of self-insurance in an amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000), and shall provide evidence of the insurance, surety bond, or proof of self-insurance to the Department of Motor Vehicles in the form and manner required by the department.
(2) Submit a detailed description of the testing program to the department. The detailed description shall include all of the following:
(A) Certification that, prior to testing on public roads, the autonomous vehicle has been tested under controlled conditions that simulate, as closely as practicable, the real world conditions that the autonomous vehicle will be subject to during this pilot project, and that the Contra Costa Transportation Authority or a private entity, or a combination of the two, has made a reasonable determination that it is safe to operate the autonomous vehicle on public roads under these conditions.
(B) Evidence satisfactory to the department that the City of San Ramon and any other local authorities with jurisdiction over the public roads in the designated privately owned business park approve of the geographic area and environmental, traffic, and speed conditions authorized for purposes of this pilot project.
(C) Certification that the autonomous vehicle can only operate in autonomous mode in the geographic area and environmental, traffic, and speed conditions authorized in this specific pilot project.
(D) Certification that this pilot project complies, or will comply, with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration guidance, if any, on the safe testing, deployment, and operation of autonomous vehicles.
(E) Certification that the autonomous vehicle used in the pilot project complies with all applicable federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or written evidence that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration either considers the absence of a steering wheel, a brake pedal, or an accelerator permissible under federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or has granted the autonomous vehicle an exemption from compliance with the relevant federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
(F) Identify to the department the autonomous vehicles that are to be tested on public roads during this pilot project. For each vehicle, the manufacturer shall provide to the department the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, the full vehicle identification number, and the license plate number and the state of issuance.
(G) Certification that the vehicle is equipped with a communication link between the vehicle and a remote operator to provide information on the vehicle’s location and status and to allow two-way communication between the remote operator and any passengers if the vehicle experiences any failures that would endanger the safety of the vehicle’s passengers or other road users while operating without a driver.
(H) Certification that the autonomous vehicle is designed to detect and respond to roadway conditions in compliance with all provisions of this code and local regulations applicable to the operation of motor vehicles.
(I) A copy of a law enforcement interaction plan, which includes information that the Contra Costa Transportation Authority or a private entity, or a combination of the two, will provide to the law enforcement agencies whose jurisdiction covers the designated privately owned business park to instruct those agencies on how to interact with the vehicle in emergency and traffic enforcement situations.
(d) The operator of the autonomous vehicle technology tested pursuant to this section shall disclose to an individual who participates in the pilot project what personal information, if any, concerning the pilot project participant is collected by an autonomous vehicle.

(1) “Smoke” or “smoking” means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, or pipe, or any other lighted or heated tobacco or plant product intended for inhalation, whether natural or synthetic, in any manner or in any form. “Smoke” or “smoking” includes the use of an electronic smoking device that creates an aerosol or vapor, in any manner or in any form, or the use of any oral smoking device for the purpose of circumventing the prohibition of smoking.
(2) (A) “Tobacco product” means any of the following:
(i) A product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for human consumption, whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, or snuff.
(ii) An electronic device that delivers nicotine or other vaporized liquids to the person inhaling from the device, including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, cigar, pipe, or hookah.
(iii) Any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product, whether or not sold separately.

(e) The governing bodies of the California State University or a community college district may continue and enforce a tobacco use policy adopted before January 1, 2017, until the prohibition set forth in subdivision (a) takes effect.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California; the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University; and the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as the segments of public postsecondary education in this state.
Existing law prohibits public employees or members of the public from smoking any tobacco product inside a public building or in a nearby outdoor area, as specified. Existing law also provides that the governing bodies of the California State University and each community college district have the authority to set enforcement standards relating to smoking on their campuses and to enforce these requirements by citation and fine, as specified. Existing law also authorizes the Trustees of the California State University to establish rules and regulations for the government and maintenance of the buildings and grounds of the university, and provides that a violation or attempted violation of these rules and regulations is a misdemeanor.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, prohibit smoking, including the use of an electronic smoking device, and the use of a tobacco product on a campus of the California State University or the California Community Colleges. The bill would authorize the governing bodies of the California State University and each community college district to set standards for the enforcement of that prohibition and to conduct a positive educational campaign to increase the awareness of a tobacco- and smoke-free policy. The bill would authorize the enforcement of this prohibition by a fine, not to exceed $25 for the first offense, $50 for the 2nd offense, and $100 for the 3rd and subsequent offenses, as specified. The bill would require the proceeds of the fine to be allocated for purposes including support of the educational operations of the campus on which the violation occurs, education about and promotion of the policy implemented by the bill, and tobacco use cessation treatment options for students of that campus.
To the extent that these provisions would impose new duties on community college districts, and extend the scope of activities on the buildings and grounds of the California State University that could be charged as misdemeanors, they would constitute a state-mandated local program.
This bill would encourage the Regents of the University of California to adopt and enforce new, or continue to enforce existing, policies substantially similar to those described above.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","An act to repeal and add Section 7597.1 of the Government Code, relating to public postsecondary education."

SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to provide continued health care coverage for Californians at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this bill take effect immediately.","Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law, subject to federal approval, imposes a hospital quality assurance fee, as specified, on certain general acute care hospitals to be deposited into the Hospital Quality Assurance Revenue Fund. Existing law provides that moneys in the Hospital Quality Assurance Revenue Fund are continuously appropriated during the first program period of January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, and available only for certain purposes, including paying for health care coverage for children, as specified, and making supplemental payments for certain services to private hospitals and increased capitation payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans. For subsequent program periods, existing law requires that the moneys in the Hospital Quality Assurance Revenue Fund be used for the above-described purposes upon appropriation by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act. Existing law provides that these provisions are inoperative on January 1, 2017, and that a hospital is not required to pay the hospital quality assurance fee after that date, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions to January 1, 2018. The bill would instead, for the second program period and subsequent program periods, require moneys in the Hospital Quality Assurance Revenue Fund to be continuously appropriated, thereby making an appropriation, for the above-described purposes.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 14169.53 and 14169.75 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal, making an appropriation therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

This act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, has been identified as related to the budget in the Budget Bill, and shall take effect immediately.","Existing law with respect to claims against public entities authorizes the “board,” as defined, to assess a surcharge to the state entity against which an approved claim was filed in an amount not to exceed 15% of the claim. Existing law requires the surcharge to be deposited into the General Fund and provides that it may be appropriated in support of the board in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code.
This bill would expand that definition to include a human trafficking caseworker who is employed by a homeless services provider that serves homeless children or youth and has completed a minimum of 8 hours of training focused on victims of human trafficking from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center.
Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, and authorizes $20,000,000 to be awarded to Napa County.
This bill would require that $20,000,000 of the amount issued by the board in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes be awarded to Napa County without the submission by it of any further adult local criminal justice facility proposal. The bill would also authorize those funds to be utilized in conjunction with a partial award made to Napa County pursuant to other specified provisions.
This bill would appropriate $3,000,000 from the Gambling Control Fund to the Department of Justice for the purposes of addressing the backlog in investigations related to cardroom licensing.

871,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 15463 is added to the Government Code, to read:
15463.
(a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

(2) “No Place Like Home Fund” means the No Place Like Home Fund established pursuant to Section 5849.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(3) “Permanent supportive housing” has the same meaning as “supportive housing” as defined in Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code, except that “permanent supportive housing” shall include associated facilities if used to provide services to housing residents.
(b) The authority may issue taxable or tax-exempt revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000), exclusive of refunding bonds but including any net premium derived from the sale of the bonds, pursuant to Sections 15441 to 15450, inclusive, for the purpose of financing permanent supportive housing pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program and through loans under subdivision (d). The authority may also utilize bond proceeds to fund necessary reserves for principal and interest, capitalized interest, credit enhancement or liquidity costs, costs of issuance, administrative expenses under Section 5849.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to reimburse loans under Section 5849.14 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(c) The authority may provide for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of redeeming, refunding, or retiring any bonds or any series or issue of bonds then outstanding issued under subdivision (b), including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of the bonds. Subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 15446 apply to, and in connection with, bonds issued under this subdivision. Sections 15441 to 15445, inclusive, and Sections 15447 to 15450, inclusive, apply to, and in connection with, bonds issued under this subdivision in the same manner and to the same extent as bonds issued under subdivision (b).
(d) The authority may make secured or unsecured loans to the Department of Housing and Community Development in connection with financing permanent supportive housing pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program or to refund bonds previously issued pursuant to this section, in accordance with an agreement between the authority and the Department of Housing and Community Development. Loan proceeds may also be used to fund reserves for principal and interest, capitalized interest, credit enhancement and liquidity costs, expenses of funding, financing, and refinancing, administrative expenses under Section 5849.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to reimburse loans under Section 5849.14 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(e) Each of the authority and the Department of Housing and Community Development may enter into any agreement for credit enhancement or liquidity, execute any instruments, and do any other acts it deems necessary, convenient, or desirable in connection with revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section or carry out any power expressly granted pursuant to this section.
(f) (1) This section provides a complete, additional, and alternative method for performing the acts authorized by this section and shall be construed as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws; provided, however, that the issuance of the bonds and refunding bonds and the execution of any agreements under this section are not subject to, and need not comply with, the requirements of any other law applicable to the issuance of those bonds or refunding bonds and the execution of those agreements, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (1), funding or financing under this section shall not exempt the permanent supportive housing from the requirements of any other law otherwise applicable to the permanent supportive housing.
SEC. 2.
Section 5849.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
5849.1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that this part is consistent with and furthers the purposes of the Mental Health Services Act, enacted by Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, within the meaning of Section 18 of that measure.
(b) The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Housing is a key factor for stabilization and recovery to occur and results in improved outcomes for individuals living with a mental illness.
(2) Untreated mental illness can increase the risk of homelessness, especially for single adults.
(3) California has the nation’s largest homeless population that is disproportionally comprised of women with children, veterans, and the chronically homeless.
(4) California has the largest number of homeless veterans in the United States at 24 percent of the total population in our nation. Fifty percent of California’s veterans live with serious mental illness and 70 percent have a substance use disorder.
(5) Fifty percent of mothers experiencing homelessness have experienced a major depressive episode since becoming homeless and 36 percent of these mothers live with post-traumatic stress disorder and 41 percent have a substance use disorder.
(6) Ninety-three percent of supportive housing tenants who live with mental illness and substance use disorders voluntarily participated in the services offered.
(7) Adults who receive 2 years of “whatever-it-takes,” or Full Service Partnership services, experience a 68 percent reduction in homelessness.
(8) For every dollar of bond funds invested in permanent supportive housing, the state and local governments can leverage a significant amount of additional dollars through tax credits, Medicaid health services funding, and other housing development funds.
(9) Tenants of permanent supportive housing reduced their visits to the emergency department by 56 percent, and their hospital admissions by 45 percent.
(10) The cost in public services for a chronically homeless Californian ranges from $60,000 to $100,000 annually. When housed, these costs are cut in half and some reports show reductions in cost of more than 70 percent, including potentially less involvement with the health and criminal justice systems.
(11) Californians have identified homelessness as their top tier priority; this measure seeks to address the needs of the most vulnerable people within this population.
(12) Having counties provide mental health programming and services is a benefit to the state.
(13) The Department of Housing and Community Development is the state entity with sufficient expertise to implement and oversee a grant or loan program for permanent supportive housing of the target population.
(14) The California Health Facilities Financing Authority is authorized by law to issue bonds and to consult with the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission and the State Department of Health Care Services concerning the implementation of a grant or loan program for California counties to support the development of programs that increase access to, and capacity for, crisis mental health services. It is therefore appropriate for the authority to issue bonds and contract for services with the Department of Housing and Community Development to provide grants or loans to California counties for permanent supportive housing for the target population.
(15) Use of bond funding will accelerate the availability of funding for the grant or loan program to provide permanent supportive housing for the target population as compared to relying on annual allocations from the Mental Health Services Fund and better allow counties to provide permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals living with mental illness.

(m) “Target population” means individuals or households as provided in Section 5600.3 who are homeless, chronically homeless, or at risk of chronic homelessness.","(1) The Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, imposes a 1% tax on that portion of a taxpayer’s taxable income that exceeds $1,000,000 and requires that the revenue from that tax be deposited in the Mental Health Services Fund to fund various county mental health programs. The MHSA authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions by a
2/3
vote, provided that the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act.
Existing law, known as the No Place Like Home Program, requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to award $2,000,000,000 among counties to finance capital costs, including, but not limited to, acquisition, design, construction, rehabilitation, or preservation, and to capitalize operating reserves, of permanent supportive housing for the target population, as specified. Existing law requires the department to distribute $1,800,000,000 through a competitive program and to allocate $200,000,000 among all counties within this state on an “over-the-counter” population basis.
The bill would authorize the California Health Facilities Financing Authority and the department to, among other things, enter into contracts to provide services pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program related to permanent supportive housing. The bill would also authorize the authority to issue taxable or tax-exempt revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000 for these purposes and to make secured or unsecured loans to the department in connection with financing permanent supportive housing pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would require that the dollar limit on amounts distributed under the No Place Like Home Program be based on the principal amount of bonds issued by the authority and loaned to the department.
The bill would additionally authorize the use of moneys in the Mental Health Services Fund for the purposes of the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would also establish and continuously appropriate the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount in the Mental Health Services Fund. The bill would require the Controller, no later than the last day of each month and prior to any transfer or expenditure from the fund for any other purpose for the following month, to transfer from the Mental Health Services Fund to the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount an amount necessary to cover the costs the authority is required to pay to the department pursuant to an above-described service contract, as determined by the authority but not to exceed an aggregate amount of $140,000,000 per year. The bill would prohibit moneys in the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount from being loaned to the General Fund pursuant to specified statutes.
The bill would exempt service contracts between the department and the authority pursuant to these provisions from specified public contracting laws. The bill would also exempt loan agreements between the department and the authority and revenue bonds issued by the authority from any other law applicable to the execution of those agreements or issuance of those bonds, including the California Environmental Quality Act.
(2) Existing law establishes the No Place Like Home Fund and continuously appropriates the moneys in this fund to the Department of Housing and Community Development for the purposes of the No Place Like Home Program. Existing law requires the deposit into the fund of, among other moneys, any proceeds from the issuance of bonds by the Treasurer.
This bill would instead require the department to deposit into the fund the proceeds of loans derived from the issuance of bonds under this bill by the California Health Facilities Financing Authority. The bill would additionally continuously appropriate moneys in the fund to the Treasurer and the authority for purposes of the No Place Like Home Program.
(3) Existing law requires counties to annually report specified information to the Department of Housing and Community Development on activities funded under the No Place Like Home Program, including information on the funded supportive housing development. Existing law also requires the department to report specified information on the program to the Legislature by December 31 of each year, commencing with the year after the first full year in which the program is in effect.
This bill would require the department to monitor county compliance with applicable program regulations, loan agreements and regulatory agreements and any agreements related to the program that designate the department as a 3rd party beneficiary, and enforce those agreements to the extent necessary and desirable in order to provide, to the greatest degree possible, the successful provision of permanent supportive housing. The bill would require the department to submit a report to the California Health Facilities Financing Authority by December 31 of each year, commencing with the year after the first full year in which the program is in effect, that contains specified information about the counties participating in the program and the services that have been provided pursuant to any service contracts between the department and the authority, as described above.
(4) Existing law establishes a procedure by which a public agency may bring an action in the superior court to determine the validity of any matter authorized by other law. Existing law authorizes an action under this procedure to determine the legality of any action by the Department of Housing and Community Development related to the No Place Like Home Program. Existing law requires the department to issue its first request for proposal for the competitive program no later than 180 days, and to make its first allocation of “over-the-counter” funds within 60 days, after the deadline for appeals under the validation procedure.
This bill would recast this authorization to instead authorize an action to determine the validity of any service contract or loan agreement between the department and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority, as described above, in accordance with specified provisions governing actions to determine the validity of bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations, or evidences of indebtedness. The bill would instead require the department to issue its first request for proposal no later than 180 days, and to make its first allocation of “over-the-counter” funds as soon as reasonably practical, but no later than 150 days, after the effective date of a final judgment with no further opportunity for appeals, in any court proceeding affirming the validity of the service contracts between the department and the authority and any bonds issued by the authority.
(5) Existing law authorizes the Department of Finance to authorize a loan from the General Fund to the No Place Like Home Fund for cashflow purposes in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000. Existing law requires that a loan comply with certain requirements, including that the purpose of the loan is to allow the department to begin implementation activities related to the No Place Like Home Program, including drafting program guidelines and regulations.
This bill would instead authorize the Department of Finance to authorize one or more loans from the General Fund to the No Place Like Home Fund in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000,000. The bill would additionally authorize loans for the purpose of allowing the Department of Housing and Community Development, the California Health Facilities Financing Authority, and the Treasurer to implement the above-described provisions pertaining to service contracts and loan agreements between the department and the authority and revenue bonds issued by the authority.
(6) Existing law makes various findings and declarations regarding the No Place Like Home Program.
This bill would make additional findings and declarations pertaining to the financing and implementation of the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would also make various technical and conforming changes to the No Place Like Home Program.
(7) This bill would declare that its provisions further the intent of the MHSA.
(8) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","An act to add Section 15463 to the Government Code, and to amend Sections 5849.1, 5849.2, 5849.3, 5849.4, 5849.5, 5849.7, 5849.8, 5849.9, 5849.11, 5849.14, 5890, and 5891 of, to add Section 5849.35 to, and to repeal and add Section 5849.13 of, the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health services, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget."

Accordingly, any retirement plan approved before January 1, 2013, by the voters of any entity excluded from coverage by this section shall not be affected by this article.
(3)
(A)
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code and who became a member of a state or local public retirement system prior to December 30, 2014.
(B) If a federal district court upholds the determination of the United States Secretary of Labor, or his or her designee, that application of this article precludes him or her from providing a certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code, this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under that section.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a multiemployer plan authorized by Section 302(c)(5) of the federal Taft-Hartley Act (29 U.S.C.

New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined benefit formula that conforms to the requirements of this article or is approved by the Legislature as provided in this subdivision.
(e) If a public employer, before January 1, 2013, offers a retirement benefit plan that consists solely of a defined contribution plan, that employer may continue to offer that plan instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article.

(i) On and after January 1, 2013, each public retirement system shall modify its plan or plans to comply with the requirements of this article and may adopt regulations or resolutions for this purpose.","The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. PEPRA exempts from its provisions certain public employees whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law until a specified federal district court decision on a certification by the United States Secretary of Labor, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner.
This bill would extend indefinitely that exemption for those public employees, whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law and who became a member of a state or local public retirement system prior to December 30, 2014.

authority
that granted the charter shall continue to be regarded as the chartering authority.
(i) During the pendency of an appeal filed under this section, a charter school, whose revocation proceedings are based on subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c), shall continue to qualify as a charter school for funding and for all other purposes of this part, and may continue to hold all existing grants, resources, and facilities, in order to ensure that the education of pupils enrolled in the
charter
school is not disrupted.

Section 14005.12 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
14005.12.
(a) For the purposes of Sections 14005.4 and 14005.7, the department shall establish the income levels for maintenance need at the lowest levels that reasonably permit medically needy persons to meet their basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and for which federal financial participation will still be provided under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that the income levels for maintenance need for medically needy aged, blind, and disabled adults, in particular, shall be based upon amounts that adequately reflect their needs.
(1) Subject to paragraph (2), reductions in the maximum aid payment levels set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 11450 in the 1991–92 fiscal year, and thereafter, shall not result in a reduction in the income levels for maintenance under this section.
(2) (A) The department shall seek any necessary federal authorization for maintaining the income levels for maintenance at the levels in effect June 30, 1991.
(B) If federal authorization is not obtained, medically needy persons shall not be required to pay the difference between the share of cost as determined based on the payment levels in effect on June 30, 1991, under Section 11450, and the share of cost as determined based on the payment levels in effect on July 1, 1991, and thereafter.
(3) Any medically needy person who was eligible for benefits under this chapter as categorically needy for the calendar month immediately preceding the effective date of the reductions in the minimum basic standards of adequate care for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program as set forth in Section 11452.018 made in the 1995–96 Regular Session of the Legislature shall not be responsible for paying his or her share of cost if all of the following apply:
(A) He or she had eligibility as categorically needy terminated by the reductions in the minimum basic standards of adequate care.
(B) He or she, but for the reductions, would be eligible to continue receiving benefits under this chapter as categorically needy.
(C) He or she is not eligible to receive benefits without a share of cost as a medically needy person pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2).
(b) In the case of a single individual, the amount of the income level for maintenance per month shall be 80 percent of the highest amount that would ordinarily be paid to a family of two persons, without any income or resources, under subdivision (a) of Section 11450, multiplied by the federal financial participation rate.
(c) In the case of a family of two adults, the income level for maintenance per month shall be the highest amount that would ordinarily be paid to a family of three persons without income or resources under subdivision (a) of Section 11450, multiplied by the federal financial participation rate.
(d) For the purposes of Sections 14005.4 and 14005.7, for a person in a medical institution or nursing facility, or for a person receiving institutional or noninstitutional services from a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly organization pursuant to Chapter 8.75 (commencing with Section 14591), the amount considered as required for maintenance per month shall be computed in accordance with, and for those purposes required by, Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Those amounts shall be computed pursuant to regulations which include providing for the following purposes:
(1) Personal and incidental needs in the amount of not less than
thirty-five dollars ($35)
eighty dollars ($80)
per month while a patient. The department
may,

(5) The community spouse monthly income allowance shall be established at the maximum amount permitted in accordance with Section 1924(d)(1)(B) of Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r-5(d)(1)(B)).
(6) The family allowance for each family member residing with the community spouse shall be computed in accordance with the formula established in Section 1924(d)(1)(C) of Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r-5(d)(1)(C)).
(e) For the purposes of Sections 14005.4 and 14005.7, with regard to a person in a licensed community care facility, the amount considered as required for maineligibility is determined as a single unit under Section 14008, the income levels for maintenance per month shall be established for each household in accordance with subdivisions (b) to (h), inclusive. The total of these levels shall be the level for the single eligibility unit.

(a) (1)
Whenever
If
a local authority determines upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey that the prima facie speed limit of 25 miles per hour established by paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 22352 is more than is reasonable or safe, the local authority may, by ordinance or resolution, determine and declare a prima facie speed limit of 20 or 15 miles per hour, whichever is justified as the appropriate speed limit by that survey.
(2) An ordinance or resolution adopted under paragraph (1) shall not be effective until appropriate signs giving notice of the speed limit are erected upon the highway and, in the case of a state highway, until the ordinance is approved by the Department of Transportation and the appropriate signs are erected upon the highway.
(b) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) or any other provision of law, a local authority may, by ordinance or resolution, determine and declare prima facie speed limits as follows:
(A) A 15 miles per hour prima facie limit in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, when approaching, at a distance of less than
500
1,320
feet from, or passing, a school building or the grounds of a school building, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit shall also apply when approaching, at a distance of less than
500
1,320
feet from, or passing, school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour.
(B) A 25 miles per hour prima facie limit in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, when approaching, at a distance of 500 to
1,000
1,320
feet from, a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period.

feet from, school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.
(2) The prima facie limits established under paragraph (1) apply only to highways that meet all of the following conditions:
(A) A maximum of two traffic lanes.
(B) A maximum posted 30 miles per hour prima facie speed limit immediately prior to and after the school zone.
(3) The prima facie limits established under paragraph (1) apply to all lanes of an affected highway, in both directions of travel.

The prima facie limit also applies when approaching or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a standard “SCHOOL” warning sign. A violation of that prima facie limit is an infraction.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 15 miles per hour prima facie limit when approaching, at a distance of less than 500 feet from, or passing, a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit would also apply when approaching, at that same distance, or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with one of those signs.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 25 miles per hour prima facie speed limit when approaching at a distance of 500 to 1,000 feet from a school building or grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit would also apply when approaching, at that same distance, or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with one of those signs.

This bill would provide that a 25 miles per hour prima facie limit in a residence district, on a highway, with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, applies, as to those local authorities, when approaching, at a distance of 500 to 1,320 feet from a school building or grounds thereof, as specified. This bill would also authorize a local authority, on the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, to extend the maximum distance up to one mile to establish a prima facie speed limit and school warning signs, as specified.
By authorizing a change in the prima facie limits, the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

SECTION 1.
Part 6.5 (commencing with Section 24455) is added to Division 9 of the Public Utilities Code, to read:
PART 6.5. Unmanned Aircraft Systems
24455.
(a) The operator of any unmanned aircraft system involved in an accident resulting in injury to an individual or damage to property shall immediately land the unmanned aircraft at the nearest location that will not jeopardize the safety of others. Moving the unmanned aircraft in accordance with this subdivision does not affect the question of fault. The operator shall also immediately do one of the following:
(1) Present his or her valid identification, if he or she has that identification, and his or her name and current residence address to the injured individual. For purposes of this section, “valid identification” includes, but is not limited to, a driver’s license, a state-issued identification card, or a passport.
(2) Locate and notify the owner or person in charge of that property of the name and address of the operator of the unmanned aircraft system involved and, upon locating the owner or person in charge of the damaged property and being requested to do so, present his or her valid identification, if he or she has that identification, and his or her name and current residence address to the other property owner or person in charge of the damaged property.
(3) Leave in a conspicuous place on the damaged property a written notice giving the name and address of the operator of the unmanned aircraft system involved and a statement of the circumstances of the accident and, without unnecessary delay, notify the police department of the city where the damage occurred or, if the damage occurred in unincorporated territory, the local headquarters of the sheriff’s department of the county where the damage occurred.
(b) The operator shall also provide the name and address of his or her employer or his or her place of business if he or she is the commercial operator of the unmanned aircraft system in the same manner as specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subdivision (a).
(c) A person who knowingly fails to comply with the requirements of this section is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250), or a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.
(d) (1) A law enforcement officer, or an employee of a police department, fire department, fire protection district, or other law enforcement agency, operating an unmanned aircraft system within the scope of his or her employment shall comply with this section unless landing the aircraft would interfere with the officer’s or employee’s duties or would put individuals at risk of further injury or property at risk of further damage.
(2) A person operating an unmanned aircraft system as part of an organized sport, league, or club shall comply with this section only if the accident results in one or more of the following:
(A) Injury to an individual.
(B) Damage to property that was not operated for purposes of the organized sport, league, or club.
(C) Damage to property that was not owned or controlled by a participant or organizer of the sport, league, or club.
(e) This section does not apply to a person operating an unmanned aircraft system pursuant to a current exemption, Certificate of Waiver, or authorization issued pursuant to Section 333 or 334 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95 (Feb. 12, 2014) 126 Stat. 11, 75-76), or other commercial operator authorization granted by, or commercial operator rule of, the Federal Aviation Administration.
(f) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1) “Unmanned aircraft” means an aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft.
(2) “Unmanned aircraft system” means an unmanned aircraft and associated elements, including, but not limited to, communication links and the components that control the unmanned aircraft that are required for the pilot in command to operate safely and efficiently in the national airspace system.
(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect, expand, alter, or limit any requirements, duties, rights, or remedies under other law, including those pertaining to notification of, or liability for, accidents involving an unmanned aircraft system.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system. Existing federal law requires the operator of an unmanned aircraft system to immediately, and by the most expeditious means available, notify the nearest National Transportation Safety Board office when, among other things, an aircraft accident, as defined, or certain serious incidents occur. Those notifications are required to include, among other things, the name of the owner of the unmanned aircraft system, the name of the operator of the unmanned aircraft system, the date and time of the accident, and the nature of the accident.
Existing state law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to any person, other than himself or herself, or in the death of any person, to immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and provide certain information and render assistance, as necessary, to the driver and occupants of the other vehicle and provide the specified information to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident. A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony. Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting only in damage to any property, including vehicles, to immediately stop the vehicle at the nearest location that will not impede traffic or otherwise jeopardize the safety of other motorists and provide certain information to the owner or person in charge of the damaged property or place that information in a conspicuous place on the damaged property. A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would require, except as specified, the operator of any unmanned aircraft system involved in an accident resulting in injury to an individual or damage to property to immediately land the unmanned aircraft at the nearest location that will not jeopardize the safety of others and provide certain information to the injured individual or the owner or person in charge of the damaged property or place that information in a conspicuous place on the damaged property. The bill would make a person who knowingly fails to comply with these provisions guilty of an infraction or a misdemeanor, as specified. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
This act shall become operative only if Senate Bill 880 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2017.","(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of
several
specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a 2nd handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that prohibition a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined,
and
including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) This bill would become operative only if SB 880 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2017.","An act to amend Sections 30515 and 30900 of, and to add Section 30680 to, the Penal Code, relating to firearms."

(2) Written, informed consent for purposes of this article shall be consistent with the informed consent requirements of the Protection of Human Subjects in Medical Experimentation Act (Chapter 1.3 (commencing with Section 24170) of Division 20).
111548.2.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 110280, 111520, or 111550, a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device may make available the manufacturer’s investigational drug, biological product, or device to an eligible patient pursuant to this article. This article does not require that a manufacturer make available an investigational drug, biological product, or device to an eligible patient.
(b) A manufacturer may do both of the following:
(1) Provide an investigational drug, biological product, or device to an eligible patient without receiving compensation.
(2) Require an eligible patient to pay the costs of, or associated with, the manufacture of the investigational drug, biological product, or device.

(d) A violation of this section shall not be subject to Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 111825).
111548.5.
This article does not create a private cause of action, and actions taken pursuant to this article shall not serve as a basis for a civil, criminal, or disciplinary claim or cause of action, including, but not limited to, product liability, medical negligence, or wrongful death, against a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device, or against any other person or entity involved in the care of an eligible patient for harm done to the eligible patient or his or her heirs resulting from the investigational drug, biological product, or device, or the use or nonuse thereof, if the manufacturer or other person or entity has complied with the terms of this article in relation to the eligible patient, unless there was a failure to exercise reasonable care.","Existing law, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce any new drug unless the drug has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Existing law requires the sponsor of a new drug to submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application and to then conduct a series of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in human populations and submit the results to the FDA in a new drug application.
Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of that law is a crime. The Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law prohibits, among other things, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a new drug or new device unless either the department has approved a new drug or device application for that new drug or new device and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended or the drug or device has been approved pursuant to specified provisions of federal law, including the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California and requires the board to take action against a licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees.
This bill would permit a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device to make the product available to eligible patients with an immediately life-threatening disease or condition, as specified. The bill would authorize, but not require, a health benefit plan, as defined, to provide coverage for any investigational drug, biological product, or device made available pursuant to these provisions. The bill would prohibit the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California from taking any disciplinary action against the license of a physician based on the physician’s recommendation to an eligible patient regarding, or prescription for, or treatment with, an investigational drug, biological product, or device if the recommendation or prescription is consistent with protocol approved by the physician’s institutional review board or an accredited institutional review board, and would require the institutional review board to biannually report specified information to the State Department of Public Health, among others. The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider’s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that a patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device.","An act to add Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 111548) to Chapter 6 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to drugs and devices."

SECTION 1.
The heading of Chapter 4.6 (commencing with Section 1070) of Part 3 of Division 2 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
CHAPTER  4.6. Public Transit Service Contracts and Contracts for the Collection and Transportation of Solid Waste
SEC. 2.
Section 1070 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1070.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) That when public agencies with jurisdiction over public transit services or the collection and transportation of solid waste award contracts to operate bus and rail services, or to provide for the collection and transportation of solid waste to a new contractor, qualified employees of the prior contractor who are not reemployed by the successor contractor face significant economic dislocation as a result.
(b) That those displaced employees rely unnecessarily upon the unemployment insurance system, public social services, and health programs, increasing costs to these vital government programs and placing a significant burden upon both the government and the taxpayers.
(c) That it serves an important social purpose to establish incentives for contractors who bid on public transit service contracts or contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste to retain qualified employees of the prior contractor to perform the same or similar work.
SEC. 3.
Section 1071 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1071.
The following definitions apply to this chapter:
(a) “Awarding authority” means any local government agency, including any city, county, special district, transit district, joint powers authority, or nonprofit corporation that awards or otherwise enters into contracts for public transit services or for the collection and transportation of solid waste performed within the State of California.
(b) “Bidder” means any person who submits a bid to an awarding authority for a public transit service contract, an exclusive contract for the collection and transportation of solid waste, or a subcontract.
(c) “Contractor” means any person who enters into a public transit service contract or an exclusive contract for the collection and transportation of solid waste with an awarding authority.
(d) “Employee” means any individual who works for a contractor or subcontractor under a contract. “Employee” does not include an executive, administrative, or professional employee exempt from the payment of overtime compensation within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 515 or any person who is not an “employee” as defined under Section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 152(3)).
(e) “Person” means any individual, proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, trust, association, or other entity that may employ individuals or enter into contracts.
(f) “Public transit services” means the provision of passenger transportation services to the general public, including paratransit service.
(g) “Service contract” means any contract the principal purpose of which is to provide public transit services or the exclusive right to provide collection and transportation of solid waste through the use of employees.
(h) “Solid waste” has the same meaning as defined in Section 40191 of the Public Resources Code.
(i) “Subcontractor” means any person who is not an employee who enters into a contract with a contractor to perform a portion of the contractor’s express obligations under a service contract. “Subcontractor” does not include a contractor’s vendors, suppliers, insurers, or other service providers.
SEC. 4.
Section 1072 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1072.
(a) A bidder shall declare as part of the bid for a service contract whether or not the bidder will retain the employees of the prior contractor or subcontractor for a period of not less than 90 days, as provided in this chapter, if awarded the service contract.
(b) An awarding authority letting a service contract out to bid shall give a 10 percent preference to any bidder who agrees to retain the employees of the prior contractor or subcontractor pursuant to subdivision (a).
(c) (1) If the awarding authority announces that it intends to let a service contract out to bid, the existing service contractor, within a reasonable time, shall provide to the awarding authority the number of employees who are performing services under the service contract and the wage rates, benefits, and job classifications of those employees. In addition, the existing service contractor shall make this information available to any entity that the awarding authority has identified as a bona fide bidder. This information shall be made available to each bona fide bidder in writing at least 30 days before bids for the service contract are due, whether by inclusion of the information in the request for bids or otherwise. If the successor service contract is awarded to a new contractor, the existing contractor shall provide the names, addresses, dates of hire, wages, benefit levels, and job classifications of employees to the successor contractor. The duties imposed by this subdivision shall be contained in all service contracts.
(2) A successor contractor or subcontractor who agrees to retain employees pursuant to subdivision (a) shall retain employees who have been employed by the prior contractor or subcontractors, except for reasonable and substantiated cause. That cause is limited to the particular employee’s performance or conduct while working under the prior contract or the employee’s failure of any controlled substances and alcohol test, physical examination, criminal background check required by law as a condition of employment, or other standard hiring qualification lawfully required by the successor contractor or subcontractor.
(3) The successor contractor or subcontractor shall make a written offer of employment to each employee to be retained pursuant to subdivision (a). That offer shall state the time within which the employee must accept that offer, but in no case less than 10 days. Nothing in this section requires the successor contractor or subcontractor to pay the same wages or offer the same benefits provided by the prior contractor or subcontractor.
(4) If, at any time, the successor contractor or subcontractor determines that fewer employees are required than were required under the prior contract or subcontract, the successor contractor or subcontractor shall retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification. In determining those employees who are qualified, the successor contractor or subcontractor may require an employee to possess any license that is required by law to operate the equipment that the employee will operate as an employee of the successor contractor or subcontractor.
SEC. 5.
Section 1075 is added to the Labor Code, to read:
1075.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following shall apply to service contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste:
(a) A successor contractor or subcontractor shall be required to retain only employees of a contractor or subcontractor under a prior service contract whose employment would be terminated if the service contract were awarded to another contractor or subcontractor.
(b) A successor contractor or subcontractor shall not be required to retain an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under a prior service contract under any of the following circumstances:
(1) If the employee of the prior contractor or subcontractor does not meet any standard hiring qualification lawfully required by the successor contractor or subcontractor for the position.
(2) If the successor contractor or subcontractor would be required to terminate or reassign an existing employee covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the successor contractor or subcontractor in order to hire the employee of the prior contractor or subcontractor.
(3) If, and to the extent, the actual number of employees meeting the requirements of this chapter exceeds the number of those employees communicated to bona fide bidders in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1072.
(c) An employee or his or her agent shall not bring an action against a successor contractor or subcontractor under subdivision (a) of Section 1073 without first giving the successor contractor or subcontractor written notice of the violation or breach and 30 days to cure the violation or breach. An awarding authority shall not terminate a service contract under subdivision (a) of Section 1074 without first giving the successor contractor or subcontractor written notice of the violation or breach and 30 days to cure the violation or breach.
(d) This chapter shall only apply to service contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste when an awarding agency decides to let an exclusive solid waste collection and transportation contract out to bid. It is not intended to determine whether or not a local agency should procure a service contract by inviting bids, extend an existing service contract, renegotiate its service contract with the prior contractor, or exercise any other right it possesses pursuant to Section 40059 of the Public Resources Code to determine aspects of solid waste handling that are of local concern.
(e) This chapter does not modify, limit, or abrogate in any manner any franchise, contract, license, or permit granted or extended by a city, county, or other local government agency before January 1, 2017.
SEC. 6.
Section 1076 is added to the Labor Code, to read:
1076.
The amendments and additions to this chapter made by the act adding this section shall not apply to contracts awarded before January 1, 2017, or to contracts for which the bid process has been completed before January 1, 2017.
SEC. 7.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires a local government agency letting a public transit service contract out to bid to give a bidding preference for contractors and subcontractors who agree to retain for a specified period certain employees who were employed to perform essentially the same services by the previous contractor or subcontractor. Such a contractor or subcontractor is required to offer employment to those employees, except for reasonable and substantiated cause. Existing law requires a successor contractor or subcontractor that determines that fewer employees are needed than under the prior contract to retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification. The existing contractor is required to provide prescribed information regarding employment under the existing service contract to the awarding authority, any entity that the awarding authority identifies as a bona fide bidder, and the successor contractor. Existing law authorizes an employee who was not offered employment or who has been discharged in violation of existing law, or his or her agent, to bring an action against the successor contractor or subcontractor in any superior court having jurisdiction over the successor contractor or subcontractor. Existing law authorizes an awarding authority to terminate a service contract under prescribed circumstances.
This bill would expand the application of these provisions to exclusive contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste. The bill would require the information provided to a bona fide bidder to be made available in writing at least 30 days before bids for the service contract are due. The bill would establish certain provisions applicable only to service contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste, including limits on the requirement to retain employees and specified requirements for notice and opportunity to cure in the context of civil action or termination. The bill would not apply to contracts awarded before January 1, 2017, or to contracts for which the bid process has been completed before January 1, 2017. By requiring local agencies to give a bidding preference under these provisions to those contractors and subcontractors for the collection and transportation of solid waste, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Sections 1070, 1071, and 1072 of, to amend the heading of Chapter 4.6 (commencing with Section 1070) of Part 3 of Division 2 of, and to add Sections 1075 and 1076 to, the Labor Code, relating to employment."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law makes it a crime, subject to specified exemptions, for a person to intentionally eavesdrop upon or record a confidential communication by means of an electronic amplifying or recording device without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication. Existing law defines a confidential communication as any communication carried on in circumstances that reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto. Existing law exempts from the prohibition the recording of a confidential communication made for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party to the communication of certain crimes, including any felony involving violence against the person making the recording.
This bill additionally would make it a crime for a person who unlawfully eavesdrops upon or records a confidential communication as described above with a health care provider, as defined, to intentionally disclose or distribute the contents of the confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication unless specified conditions are met. The bill would make this prohibition subject to the same exemptions as are applicable to the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording a confidential communication as described above. The bill would also specify the conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting the commission of those offenses, as specified. The bill would specify, with respect to the exemption for recording communications believed to relate to the commission of a crime by a party to the communication, that a felony involving violence includes human trafficking, as defined. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law authorizes any person who has been injured by a violation of the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording confidential communications, and related offenses, to bring an action against the person who committed the violation to enjoin and restrain the violation, as well as to bring an action for monetary damages, as specified.
This bill would provide that the monetary damages be imposed per violation of the above-described provisions.
(3) Existing law makes the above-specified crime of eavesdropping punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,500 or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years. If the person has previously been convicted of eavesdropping, or has previously been convicted of specified invasion of privacy crimes, existing law requires the person to be punished by a fine not exceeding $10,000, by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years.
This bill would require the above-specified fines to be imposed on a per-violation basis and would impose the same penalties prescribed for the unlawful eavesdropping upon or recording of a confidential communication to the disclosure crimes created by the bill. The bill also would make various technical, nonsubstantive changes to existing law.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 632, 633.5, and 637.2 of, and to add Section 632.01 to, the Penal Code, relating to confidential communications."

Existing law defines the term “firearm” for various regulatory purposes, including, among others and subject to exceptions, the requirement that firearms be transferred by or through a licensed firearms dealer, the requirement of a 10-day waiting period prior to delivery of a firearm by a dealer, the requirement that firearm purchasers be subject to a background check, and the prohibition on certain classes of persons, such as felons, possessing firearms. Under existing law, the term “firearm” includes the frame or receiver of the weapon. Existing law makes a violation of certain of these prohibitions a crime.
This bill would define a frame or receiver as that part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt, or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel, and would include within this definition a frame or receiver blank, casting, or machined body that requires further machining or molding to be used as part of a functional weapon so long as it has been designed and is clearly identifiable as being used exclusively as part of a functional weapon.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from making more than one application to purchase a handgun within any 30-day period. Violation of that prohibition is a crime. Existing law exempts from that prohibition a firearms transaction where neither of the parties is a firearms dealer if the transaction is completed through a dealer. Existing law prohibits a firearms dealer from delivering a handgun to a person whenever the dealer is notified by the Department of Justice that within the preceding 30-day period the purchaser has made another application to purchase a handgun that does not fall within an exception to the 30-day prohibition. A violation of that delivery prohibition by the dealer is a crime.
This bill would make the 30-day prohibition and the dealer delivery prohibition described above applicable to all types of firearms. The bill would delete the private party transaction exemption to the 30-day prohibition and instead would exempt from that prohibition the transfer of a firearm conducted through a licensed firearms dealer if the firearm is being transferred by bequest or intestate succession, the purchase of a firearm that is not a handgun or a finished frame or receiver by a licensed hunter, and the purchase of a firearm from a nonprofit entity conducting an auction or similar event, as specified. The bill would make additional conforming changes and technical, nonsubstantive changes.
By expanding the scope of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate changes to Sections 26835 and 27535 of the Penal Code proposed by both this bill and SB 894, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 26835, 27535, 27540, and 27590 of the Penal Code, relating to firearms."
884,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Over the past decade, the wage gap has barely budged and wage disparities continue to persist. In 2015, the gender wage gap in California stood at 16 cents on the dollar. For women of color, wage inequality is much worse. African American women in California make just 63 cents and Hispanic women less than 43 cents for every dollar white non-Hispanic men make.
(b) The problematic practices of seeking salary history from job applicants and relying on prior salary to set employees’ pay rates contribute to the gender wage gap by perpetuating wage inequalities across the occupational spectrum. Women are paid less than men in 99.6 percent of occupations and are more likely to face financial penalties for taking time out of the paid workforce due to childbearing and family caregiving responsibilities.
(c) When employers make salary decisions during the hiring process based on prospective employees’ prior salaries or require women to disclose their prior salaries during salary negotiations, women often end up at a sharp disadvantage and historical patterns of gender bias and discrimination repeat themselves, causing women to continue earning less than their male counterparts.
(d) Government officials have recognized the discriminatory impact that prior salaries can have on women in the job market. In 2015, on Equal Pay Day, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) advised employers on important steps they could take to ensure equal pay for equal work, including eliminating “discriminatory pay gaps on the basis of prior salary” and the 2005 EEOC Compliance Manual states that “[p]rior salary cannot, by itself, justify a compensation disparity.”
(e) In July of 2015, the acting director of the federal Office of Personnel Management provided guidance on advancing pay equality in the federal government, warning that reliance on salary history “could potentially adversely affect a candidate who is returning to the workplace after having taken extended time off from his or her career or for whom an existing rate of pay is not reflective of the candidate’s current qualifications or existing labor market conditions.”
(f) Courts also have warned against relying on salary history and have stated that prior salary cannot, by itself, justify a wage disparity. In Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, (1974) 417 U.S. 188, the United States Supreme Court held that a pay differential which “ar[ises] simply because men would not work at the low rates paid women ... and reflect[s] a job market in which [the employer] could pay women less than men for the same work” is not based on a cognizable factor other than sex under the Equal Pay Act (Public Law 88-38) (Id., at p. 205). More recently, in Rizo v. Yovino, Fresno County Superintendent of Schools, United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. 1:14-cv-0423-MJS, the district court denied summary judgment on defendant’s motion under the federal Equal Pay Act based on its finding that, “a pay structure based exclusively on prior wages is so inherently fraught with the risk — indeed, here, the virtual certainty — that it will perpetuate a discriminatory wage disparity between men and women that it cannot stand, even if motivated by a legitimate non-discriminatory business purpose.”(Id., at p. 16). The court went on to explain that,“say[ing] an otherwise unjustified pay differential between women and men performing equal work is based on a factor other than sex because it reflects historical market forces which value the equal work of one sex over the other perpetuates the market’s sex-based subjective assumptions and stereotyped misconceptions Congress passed the Equal Pay Act to eradicate.” (Id., at p. 17).
(g) This act will codify existing law with respect to the provision stating that prior salary cannot, by itself, justify a wage differential under Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code.
(h) This act will also help ensure that both employers and workers are able to negotiate and set salaries based on the requirements, expectations, and qualifications of the person and the job in question, rather than on an individual’s prior earnings, which may reflect widespread, longstanding, gender-based wage disparities in the labor market.
SEC. 2.
Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1197.5.
(a) An employer shall not pay any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, except where the employer demonstrates:
(1) The wage differential is based upon one or more of the following factors:
(A) A seniority system.
(B) A merit system.
(C) A system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production.
(D) A bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience. This factor shall apply only if the employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or derived from a sex-based differential in compensation, is job related with respect to the position in question, and is consistent with a business necessity. For purposes of this subparagraph, “business necessity” means an overriding legitimate business purpose such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the business purpose it is supposed to serve. This defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an alternative business practice exists that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.
(2) Each factor relied upon is applied reasonably.
(3) The one or more factors relied upon account for the entire wage differential. Prior salary shall not, by itself, justify any disparity in compensation.
(b) Any employer who violates subdivision (a) is liable to the employee affected in the amount of the wages, and interest thereon, of which the employee is deprived by reason of the violation, and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.
(c) The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement shall administer and enforce this section. If the division finds that an employer has violated this section, it may supervise the payment of wages and interest found to be due and unpaid to employees under subdivision (a). Acceptance of payment in full made by an employer and approved by the division shall constitute a waiver on the part of the employee of the employee’s cause of action under subdivision (g).
(d) Every employer shall maintain records of the wages and wage rates, job classifications, and other terms and conditions of employment of the persons employed by the employer. All of the records shall be kept on file for a period of three years.
(e) Any employee may file a complaint with the division that the wages paid are less than the wages to which the employee is entitled under subdivision (a) or that the employer is in violation of subdivision (j). The complaint shall be investigated as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 98.7. The division shall keep confidential the name of any employee who submits to the division a complaint regarding an alleged violation of subdivision (a) or (j) until the division establishes the validity of the complaint, unless the division must abridge confidentiality to investigate the complaint. The name of the complaining employee shall remain confidential if the complaint is withdrawn before the confidentiality is abridged by the division. The division shall take all proceedings necessary to enforce the payment of any sums found to be due and unpaid to these employees.
(f) The department or division may commence and prosecute, unless otherwise requested by the employee or affected group of employees, a civil action on behalf of the employee and on behalf of a similarly affected group of employees to recover unpaid wages and liquidated damages under subdivision (a), and in addition shall be entitled to recover costs of suit. The consent of any employee to the bringing of any action shall constitute a waiver on the part of the employee of the employee’s cause of action under subdivision (g) unless the action is dismissed without prejudice by the department or the division, except that the employee may intervene in the suit or may initiate independent action if the suit has not been determined within 180 days from the date of the filing of the complaint.
(g) Any employee receiving less than the wage to which the employee is entitled under this section may recover in a civil action the balance of the wages, including interest thereon, and an equal amount as liquidated damages, together with the costs of the suit and reasonable attorney’s fees, notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage.
(h) A civil action to recover wages under subdivision (a) may be commenced no later than two years after the cause of action occurs, except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced no later than three years after the cause of action occurs.
(i) If an employee recovers amounts due the employee under subdivision (b), and also files a complaint or brings an action under subdivision (d) of Section 206 of Title 29 of the United States Code which results in an additional recovery under federal law for the same violation, the employee shall return to the employer the amounts recovered under subdivision (b), or the amounts recovered under federal law, whichever is less.
(j) (1) An employer shall not discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against, any employee by reason of any action taken by the employee to invoke or assist in any manner the enforcement of this section. An employer shall not prohibit an employee from disclosing the employee’s own wages, discussing the wages of others, inquiring about another employee’s wages, or aiding or encouraging any other employee to exercise his or her rights under this section. Nothing in this section creates an obligation to disclose wages.
(2) Any employee who has been discharged, discriminated or retaliated against, in the terms and conditions of his or her employment because the employee engaged in any conduct delineated in this section may recover in a civil action reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer, including interest thereon, as well as appropriate equitable relief.
(3) A civil action brought under this subdivision may be commenced no later than one year after the cause of action occurs.

(b) An employer shall not pay any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of another race or ethnicity for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, except where the employer demonstrates:
(1) The wage differential is based upon one or more of the following factors:
(A) A seniority system.
(B) A merit system.
(C) A system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production.
(D) A bona fide factor other than race or ethnicity, such as education, training, or experience. This factor shall apply only if the employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or derived from a race- or ethnicity-based differential in compensation, is job related with respect to the position in question, and is consistent with a business necessity. For purposes of this subparagraph, “business necessity” means an overriding legitimate business purpose such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the business purpose it is supposed to serve.

(d) The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement shall administer and enforce this section. If the division finds that an employer has violated this section, it may supervise the payment of wages and interest found to be due and unpaid to employees under subdivision (a) or (b). Acceptance of payment in full made by an employer and approved by the division shall constitute a waiver on the part of the employee of the employee’s cause of action under subdivision (h).
(e) Every employer shall maintain records of the wages and wage rates, job classifications, and other terms and conditions of employment of the persons employed by the employer. All of the records shall be kept on file for a period of three years.

The division shall keep confidential the name of any employee who submits to the division a complaint regarding an alleged violation of subdivision (a), (b), or (k) until the division establishes the validity of the complaint, unless the division must abridge confidentiality to investigate the complaint. The name of the complaining employee shall remain confidential if the complaint is withdrawn before the confidentiality is abridged by the division. The division shall take all proceedings necessary to enforce the payment of any sums found to be due and unpaid to these employees.
(g) The department or division may commence and prosecute, unless otherwise requested by the employee or affected group of employees, a civil action on behalf of the employee and on behalf of a similarly affected group of employees to recover unpaid wages and liquidated damages under subdivision (a) or (b), and in addition shall be entitled to recover costs of suit. The consent of any employee to the bringing of any action shall constitute a waiver on the part of the employee of the employee’s cause of action under subdivision (h) unless the action is dismissed without prejudice by the department or the division, except that the employee may intervene in the suit or may initiate independent action if the suit has not been determined within 180 days from the date of the filing of the complaint.
(h) An employee receiving less than the wage to which the employee is entitled under this section may recover in a civil action the balance of the wages, including interest thereon, and an equal amount as liquidated damages, together with the costs of the suit and reasonable attorney’s fees, notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage.
(i) A civil action to recover wages under subdivision (a) or (b) may be commenced no later than two years after the cause of action occurs, except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced no later than three years after the cause of action occurs.
(j) If an employee recovers amounts due the employee under subdivision (c), and also files a complaint or brings an action under subdivision (d) of Section 206 of Title 29 of the United States Code which results in an additional recovery under federal law for the same violation, the employee shall return to the employer the amounts recovered under subdivision (c), or the amounts recovered under federal law, whichever is less.
(k) (1) An employer shall not discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against, any employee by reason of any action taken by the employee to invoke or assist in any manner the enforcement of this section. An employer shall not prohibit an employee from disclosing the employee’s own wages, discussing the wages of others, inquiring about another employee’s wages, or aiding or encouraging any other employee to exercise his or her rights under this section. Nothing in this section creates an obligation to disclose wages.
(2) Any employee who has been discharged, discriminated or retaliated against, in the terms and conditions of his or her employment because the employee engaged in any conduct delineated in this section may recover in a civil action reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer, including interest thereon, as well as appropriate equitable relief.
(3) A civil action brought under this subdivision may be commenced no later than one year after the cause of action occurs.

Section 2.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code proposed by both this bill and Senate Bill 1063. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 1063, in which case Section 2 of this bill shall not become operative.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law generally prohibits an employer from paying an employee at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex in the same establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions. Existing law establishes exceptions to that prohibition, including, among others, where the payment is made based on any bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for an employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer, agent, or employee of another person to pay or cause to be paid to any employee a wage less than the rate paid to an employee of the opposite sex as required by these provisions, or who reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with these provisions. Existing law also makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to refuse or neglect to comply with the above provisions of law.
This bill would specify that prior salary cannot, by itself, justify any disparity in compensation under the bona fide factor exception to the above prohibition. By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code proposed by SB 1063 that would become operative only if SB 1063 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code, relating to employers."

(C) A conservator of the victim who shall present to law enforcement identification pursuant to subdivision (c) and a copy of his or her letters of conservatorship demonstrating that he or she is the appointed conservator of the victim.

This bill would also require state or local law enforcement agencies to provide a copy of those reports to a victim of sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult, as defined. The bill would define “victim” for these purposes to include a minor who is 12 years of age or older. The bill would require these provisions to apply to requests for reports made within 2 years from the date of completion of the sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult incident report. This bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Section 43211 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
43211.
(a) A new motor vehicle sold in California shall meet the emission standards adopted by the state board, and a manufacturer who sells, attempts to sell, or causes to be offered for sale a new motor vehicle that fails to meet the applicable emission standards shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars ($37,500) for each such action.
(b) For purposes of calculating the penalty for failure to meet zero-emission vehicle credit requirements pursuant to Sections 1962, 1962.1, and 1962.2 of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations or any subsequent or related regulation, the civil penalty shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) per zero-emission vehicle credit.
(c) The state board shall adjust the maximum penalty specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index. The adjustment shall be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(d) Any penalty recovered pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the General Fund.

The payment of such penalties to the state board and making the vehicles compliant with applicable emission control laws and test procedures may be required by the executive officer of the state board as conditions for the further sale in this state of those motor vehicles.
(2) The state board shall adjust the maximum penalty specified in paragraph (1) for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index. The adjustment shall be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

SEC. 6.
Section 43214 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
43214.
The state board may order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to bring its vehicles into compliance with the emissions configuration to which they were certified. Compliance with the order may be required by the executive officer of the state board as a condition for the continued sale of those motor vehicles by that manufacturer in this state.","(1) Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt and implement standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles that the state board finds to be necessary and technologically feasible. Existing law prohibits a new motor vehicle from being sold in the state that does not meet the emissions standards adopted by the state board. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board is subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 per vehicle. Existing law provides that any manufacturer who sells, attempts to sell, or causes to be offered for sale a new motor vehicle that fails to meet the applicable emission standards is subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 per violation. Existing law provides that a manufacturer or distributor who does not comply with the emission standards or the test procedures adopted by the state board is subject to a civil penalty of $50 per vehicle.
This bill would increase those penalties to up to $37,500 per violation. The bill would require the state board to adjust those maximum penalties for inflation, as specified, and would exempt those adjustments from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would authorize the state board to require the payment of a penalty for the violation of specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board, and making the products compliant with specified laws, as conditions for the continued sale of those products.
This bill would authorize the state board to order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to bring the vehicles into compliance with the emissions configuration to which they were certified. The bill would authorize the state board to require the manufacturer to be in compliance with the state board’s order as a condition for the continued sale of motor vehicles in the state.
(2) Existing law prohibits a person who is a state resident or who operates an established place of business within the state from importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet specified emissions standards. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per vehicle.
This bill instead would prohibit any person from offering for sale, introducing into commerce, importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet those specified emissions standards.
This bill would increase the civil penalty to up to $37,500 per violation and up to $10,000 for a dealer, as defined, for violating those specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. The bill would require the state board to adjust those maximum penalties for inflation, as specified, and would exempt those adjustments from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would authorize the state board to require the payment of the penalty, and making the motor vehicles compliant with specified laws, as conditions for the continued or further sale in the state of those motor vehicles.
This bill would require the state board to limit to $5,000 a specified civil penalty imposed on a manufacturer who does not meet the requirements of specified regulations that require manufacturers to have a specified percentage of their new motor vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles.","An act to amend Sections 43016, 43151, 43154, 43211, and 43212 of, and to add Section 43214 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to vehicular air pollution."
889,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 361.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, as added by Section 48 of Chapter 773 of the Statutes of 2015, is amended to read:
361.2.
(a) When a court orders removal of a child pursuant to Section 361, the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child, with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of Section 300, who desires to assume custody of the child. If that parent requests custody, the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child. The fact that the parent is enrolled in a certified substance abuse treatment facility that allows a dependent child to reside with his or her parent shall not be, for that reason alone, prima facie evidence that placement with that parent would be detrimental.
(b) If the court places the child with that parent it may do any of the following:
(1) Order that the parent become legal and physical custodian of the child. The court may also provide reasonable visitation by the noncustodial parent. The court shall then terminate its jurisdiction over the child. The custody order shall continue unless modified by a subsequent order of the superior court. The order of the juvenile court shall be filed in any domestic relation proceeding between the parents.
(2) Order that the parent assume custody subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and require that a home visit be conducted within three months. In determining whether to take the action described in this paragraph, the court shall consider any concerns that have been raised by the child’s current caregiver regarding the parent. After the social worker conducts the home visit and files his or her report with the court, the court may then take the action described in paragraph (1), (3), or this paragraph. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to imply that the court is required to take the action described in this paragraph as a prerequisite to the court taking the action described in either paragraph (1) or (3).
(3) Order that the parent assume custody subject to the supervision of the juvenile court. In that case the court may order that reunification services be provided to the parent or guardian from whom the child is being removed, or the court may order that services be provided solely to the parent who is assuming physical custody in order to allow that parent to retain later custody without court supervision, or that services be provided to both parents, in which case the court shall determine, at review hearings held pursuant to Section 366, which parent, if either, shall have custody of the child.
(c) The court shall make a finding either in writing or on the record of the basis for its determination under subdivisions (a) and (b).
(d) Part 6 (commencing with Section 7950) of Division 12 of the Family Code shall apply to the placement of a child pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (e).
(e) When the court orders removal pursuant to Section 361, the court shall order the care, custody, control, and conduct of the child to be under the supervision of the social worker who may place the child in any of the following:
(1) The home of a noncustodial parent as described in subdivision (a), regardless of the parent’s immigration status.
(2) The approved home of a relative, regardless of the relative’s immigration status.
(3) The approved home of a nonrelative extended family member as defined in Section 362.7.
(4) The approved home of a resource family as defined in Section 16519.5.
(5) A foster home considering first a foster home in which the child has been placed before an interruption in foster care, if that placement is in the best interest of the child and space is available.
(6) A home or facility in accordance with the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. Sec. 1901 et seq.).
(7) A suitable licensed community care facility, except a runaway and homeless youth shelter licensed by the State Department of Social Services pursuant to Section 1502.35 of the Health and Safety Code.

(9) A child of any age who is placed in a community care facility licensed as a group home for children or a short-term residential treatment center, as defined in subdivision (ad) of Section 11400 and paragraph (18) of subdivision (a) of Section 1502 of the Health and Safety Code, shall have a case plan that indicates that placement is for purposes of providing short term, specialized, and intensive treatment for the child, the case plan specifies the need for, nature of, and anticipated duration of this treatment, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 16501.1, and the case plan includes transitioning the child to a less restrictive environment and the projected timeline by which the child will be transitioned to a less restrictive environment. If the placement is longer than six months, the placement shall be documented consistent with paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 16501.1 and shall be approved by the deputy director or director of the county child welfare department.
(A) A child under six years of age shall not be placed in a community care facility licensed as a group home for children, or a short-term residential treatment center, except under the following circumstances:
(i) When the facility meets the applicable regulations adopted under Section 1530.8 of the Health and Safety Code and standards developed pursuant to Section 11467.1 of this code, and the deputy director or director of the county child welfare department has approved the case plan.
(ii) The short term, specialized, and intensive treatment period shall not exceed 120 days, unless the county has made progress toward or is actively working toward implementing the case plan that identifies the services or supports necessary to transition the child to a family setting, circumstances beyond the county’s control have prevented the county from obtaining those services or supports within the timeline documented in the case plan, and the need for additional time pursuant to the case plan is documented by the caseworker and approved by a deputy director or director of the county child welfare department.
(iii) To the extent that placements pursuant to this paragraph are extended beyond an initial 120 days, the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply to each extension. In addition, the deputy director or director of the county child welfare department shall approve the continued placement no less frequently than every 60 days.
(iv) In addition, when a case plan indicates that placement is for purposes of providing family reunification services. The facility shall offer family reunification services that meet the needs of the individual child and his or her family, permit parents to have reasonable access to their children 24 hours a day, encourage extensive parental involvement in meeting the daily needs of their children, and employ staff trained to provide family reunification services. In addition, one of the following conditions exists:
(I) The child’s parent is also under the jurisdiction of the court and resides in the facility.
(II) The child’s parent is participating in a treatment program affiliated with the facility and the child’s placement in the facility facilitates the coordination and provision of reunification services.

(B) A child who is 6 to 12 years of age, inclusive, may be placed in a community care facility licensed as a group home for children or a short-term residential treatment center under the following conditions.
(i) The short-term, specialized, and intensive treatment period shall not exceed six months, unless the county has made progress or is actively working toward implementing the case plan that identifies the services or supports necessary to transition the child to a family setting, circumstances beyond the county’s control have prevented the county from obtaining those services or supports within the timeline documented in the case plan, and the need for additional time pursuant to the case plan is documented by the caseworker and approved by a deputy director or director of the county child welfare department.
(ii) To the extent that placements pursuant to this paragraph are extended beyond an initial six months, the requirements of this subparagraph shall apply to each extension. In addition, the deputy director or director of the county child welfare department shall approve the continued placement no less frequently than every 60 days.
(10) Any child placed in a short-term residential treatment center shall be either of the following:
(A) A child who has been assessed as meeting one of the placement requirements set forth in subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 11462.01.
(B) A child under 6 years of age who is placed with his or her minor parent or for the purpose of reunification pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (9).
(11) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to allow a social worker to place any dependent child outside the United States, except as specified in subdivision (f).
(f) (1) A child under the supervision of a social worker pursuant to subdivision (e) shall not be placed outside the United States prior to a judicial finding that the placement is in the best interest of the child, except as required by federal law or treaty.
(2) The party or agency requesting placement of the child outside the United States shall carry the burden of proof and shall show, by clear and convincing evidence, that placement outside the United States is in the best interest of the child.
(3) In determining the best interest of the child, the court shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:
(A) Placement with a relative.
(B) Placement of siblings in the same home.
(C) Amount and nature of any contact between the child and the potential guardian or caretaker.
(D) Physical and medical needs of the dependent child.
(E) Psychological and emotional needs of the dependent child.
(F) Social, cultural, and educational needs of the dependent child.
(G) Specific desires of any dependent child who is 12 years of age or older.
(4) If the court finds that a placement outside the United States is, by clear and convincing evidence, in the best interest of the child, the court may issue an order authorizing the social worker to make a placement outside the United States. A child subject to this subdivision shall not leave the United States prior to the issuance of the order described in this paragraph.
(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “outside the United States” shall not include the lands of any federally recognized American Indian tribe or Alaskan Natives.
(6) This subdivision shall not apply to the placement of a dependent child with a parent pursuant to subdivision (a).
(g) (1) If the child is taken from the physical custody of the child’s parent or guardian and unless the child is placed with relatives, the child shall be placed in foster care in the county of residence of the child’s parent or guardian in order to facilitate reunification of the family.
(2) In the event that there are no appropriate placements available in the parent’s or guardian’s county of residence, a placement may be made in an appropriate place in another county, preferably a county located adjacent to the parent’s or guardian’s community of residence.
(3) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring multiple disruptions of the child’s placement corresponding to frequent changes of residence by the parent or guardian. In determining whether the child should be moved, the social worker shall take into consideration the potential harmful effects of disrupting the placement of the child and the parent’s or guardian’s reason for the move.
(4) When it has been determined that it is necessary for a child to be placed in a county other than the child’s parent’s or guardian’s county of residence, the specific reason the out-of-county placement is necessary shall be documented in the child’s case plan. If the reason the out-of-county placement is necessary is the lack of resources in the sending county to meet the specific needs of the child, those specific resource needs shall be documented in the case plan.
(5) When it has been determined that a child is to be placed out of county either in a group home or with a foster family agency for subsequent placement in a certified foster family home, and the sending county is to maintain responsibility for supervision and visitation of the child, the sending county shall develop a plan of supervision and visitation that specifies the supervision and visitation activities to be performed and specifies that the sending county is responsible for performing those activities. In addition to the plan of supervision and visitation, the sending county shall document information regarding any known or suspected dangerous behavior of the child that indicates the child may pose a safety concern in the receiving county. Upon implementation of the Child Welfare Services Case Management System, the plan of supervision and visitation, as well as information regarding any known or suspected dangerous behavior of the child, shall be made available to the receiving county upon placement of the child in the receiving county. If placement occurs on a weekend or holiday, the information shall be made available to the receiving county on or before the end of the next business day.
(6) When it has been determined that a child is to be placed out of county and the sending county plans that the receiving county shall be responsible for the supervision and visitation of the child, the sending county shall develop a formal agreement between the sending and receiving counties. The formal agreement shall specify the supervision and visitation to be provided the child, and shall specify that the receiving county is responsible for providing the supervision and visitation. The formal agreement shall be approved and signed by the sending and receiving counties prior to placement of the child in the receiving county. In addition, upon completion of the case plan, the sending county shall provide a copy of the completed case plan to the receiving county. The case plan shall include information regarding any known or suspected dangerous behavior of the child that indicates the child may pose a safety concern to the receiving county.
(h) Whenever the social worker must change the placement of the child and is unable to find a suitable placement within the county and must place the child outside the county, the placement shall not be made until he or she has served written notice on the parent or guardian, the child’s attorney, and, if the child is 10 years of age or older, on the child, at least 14 days prior to the placement, unless the child’s health or well-being is endangered by delaying the action or would be endangered if prior notice were given. The notice shall state the reasons that require placement outside the county. The child or parent or guardian may object to the placement not later than seven days after receipt of the notice and, upon objection, the court shall hold a hearing not later than five days after the objection and prior to the placement. The court shall order out-of-county placement if it finds that the child’s particular needs require placement outside the county.
(i) If the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to Section 361, the court shall consider whether the family ties and best interest of the child will be served by granting visitation rights to the child’s grandparents. The court shall clearly specify those rights to the social worker.
(j) If the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to Section 361, the court shall consider whether there are any siblings under the court’s jurisdiction, or any nondependent siblings in the physical custody of a parent subject to the court’s jurisdiction, the nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings, the appropriateness of developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to Section 16002, and the impact of the sibling relationships on the child’s placement and planning for legal permanence.
(k) (1) An agency shall ensure placement of a child in a home that, to the fullest extent possible, best meets the day-to-day needs of the child. A home that best meets the day-to-day needs of the child shall satisfy all of the following criteria:
(A) The child’s caregiver is able to meet the day-to-day health, safety, and well-being needs of the child.
(B) The child’s caregiver is permitted to maintain the least restrictive family setting that promotes normal childhood experiences and that serves the day-to-day needs of the child.
(C) The child is permitted to engage in reasonable, age-appropriate day-to-day activities that promote normal childhood experiences for the foster child.
(2) The foster child’s caregiver shall use a reasonable and prudent parent standard, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 362.04, to determine day-to-day activities that are age appropriate to meet the needs of the child. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a child’s caregiver to permit the child to engage in day-to-day activities that carry an unreasonable risk of harm, or subject the child to abuse or neglect.
(l) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2017.
SEC. 2.
To the extent that this act has an overall effect of increasing the costs already borne by a local agency for programs or levels of service mandated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation within the meaning of Section 36 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, it shall apply to local agencies only to the extent that the state provides annual funding for the cost increase. Any new program or higher level of service provided by a local agency pursuant to this act above the level for which funding has been provided shall not require a subvention of funds by the state nor otherwise be subject to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits a social worker, when he or she must place a dependent child outside the county, from making the placement until he or she has served written notice on the parent or guardian at least 14 days prior to the placement, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the parent or guardian to object to the placement.
This bill would require that the notice also be served on the child’s attorney and, if the child is 10 years of age or older, on the child, and would authorize the child to object to the placement. By imposing additional duties on county social workers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 361.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to juveniles."

(d) This act is intended to promote volunteer service performed by pupils, since research has demonstrated many positive outcomes of pupil volunteer service, including, but not necessarily limited to, all of the following:
(1) Senior pupils who are engaged in volunteer work, whether through school or on their own, are likely to have significantly higher civics assessment scale scores than pupils who did not participate in volunteer work as reported by the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 1998.
(2) Community leaders report that service learning partnerships help build more positive community attitudes toward youth.
(3) Schools that support service learning and community service are more likely to have positive relationships with their community.

These requirements include the completion of 3 courses in social studies, including one-year courses in United States history and geography and world history, culture, and geography, and one-semester courses in American government and economics.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to service learning. The bill would additionally require, commencing with the high school class graduating during the 2021–22 school year, and for the high school classes graduating in each subsequent school year, at least one of the courses completed by a pupil to satisfy the graduation requirements referenced above to have a service learning component. The bill would define “service learning” for this purpose.

If the state board adopts these proposed curriculum standards, the bill would require the curriculum standards to be implemented by school districts, commencing with the 2018–19 school year, as a component of courses in order to satisfy the graduation requirements enacted by this bill. To the extent the implementation of these curriculum standards would impose new duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2)  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 51225.3 of, and to add Section 51221.1 to, the Education Code, relating to school curriculum."
891,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 87482.3 is added to the Education Code, to read:
87482.3.
(a) (1) On or after January 1, 2017, community college districts that do not have a collective bargaining agreement with part-time, temporary faculty in effect as of January 1, 2017, shall commence negotiations with the exclusive representatives for part-time, temporary faculty regarding the terms and conditions required by subdivision (b). The parties shall negotiate these rights for part-time, temporary faculty.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that both of the following shall occur:
(A) The adoption of provisions in compliance with subdivision (b) shall be included as part of the usual and customary negotiations between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty.
(B) A community college district shall meet the minimum standards established by this section through the negotiation process between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty.
(b) (1) A community college district that enters into a collective bargaining agreement on or after January 1, 2017, shall comply with all of the following:
(A) Upon initial hire, and subsequently thereafter, a part-time, temporary faculty member shall be evaluated pursuant to the requirements of Section 87663.
(B) After six semesters or nine quarters of service, exclusive of summer and intersession terms, each part-time, temporary faculty member who has not received a less-than-satisfactory evaluation during the preceding six semesters or nine quarters of service shall be placed on a seniority list for each assignment at each college where he or she holds a current assignment during the seventh semester or 10th quarter of service, irrespective of how many times he or she has completed each unique assignment. The seniority for all assignments shall be determined based on the first date of hire at the applicable college. Seniority lists shall be by campus unless otherwise locally negotiated between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty.
(C) For semester seven or quarter 10 and beyond, each community college district shall endeavor to maintain the workload equivalent that the part-time, temporary faculty member was assigned during semester six or quarter nine, subject to all of the following:
(i) As new assignments become available due to growth or attrition, these assignments shall be offered in seniority order to those part-time, temporary faculty members who have qualified to be placed on the seniority list pursuant to subparagraph (B), and previously successfully completed that same assignment. These assignments may be made up to a maximum annualized load, exclusive of summer and intersession terms, in the range of 60 to 67 percent of a full-time equivalent load.
(ii) In cases where a reduction in assignment needs to occur due to program needs, budget constraints, or more contract faculty hires, the reduction shall occur first from among those part-time, temporary faculty members who have not yet qualified to be placed on the seniority list, and thereafter in reverse seniority order, with the least senior part-time, temporary faculty member reduced first. Any rights to a certain workload equivalent shall be maintained for a period of 18 months. In cases of class cancellation due to low enrollment, faculty members shall displace faculty members who are lower than they are on the seniority list, if the class cancellation occurs prior to the first class meeting day.
(iii) Each new assignment successfully completed shall be added to the part-time, temporary faculty member seniority list.
(D) Procedures governing refusal or rejection of offered assignments, diminution or loss of seniority rights, and additional leave or break-in-service provisions shall be locally negotiated between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty.
(E) In cases where a part-time, temporary faculty member, subsequent to qualifying to be placed on the seniority list, receives a less-than-satisfactory evaluation, as that term is defined in the collective bargaining agreement between the community college district and the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty, the faculty member shall be provided a written plan of remediation with concrete suggestions for improvement. The faculty member shall be evaluated again the following semester. If the outcome of this subsequent evaluation is also less than satisfactory, the faculty member shall lose all seniority rights, and may be dismissed at the discretion of the district. Appeal and grievance rights and procedures, if any, shall be subject to local collective bargaining.
(F) In all cases, part-time faculty assignments are temporary in nature, contingent on enrollment and funding, and subject to program changes, and no part-time faculty member has a reasonable assurance of continued employment at any point, irrespective of the status, length of service, or reemployment preference seniority of that part-time, temporary faculty member.
(2) (A) A community college district that has a collective bargaining agreement in effect as of January 1, 2017, that has provisions in place that require implementation of all of the following, and executes a signed written agreement pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be exempt from this subdivision upon the expiration of that agreement:
(i) Part-time, temporary faculty assignment based on seniority up to the range of 60 to 67 percent of a full-time equivalent load.
(ii) A regular evaluation process for part-time, temporary faculty.
(iii) Due process for termination once a part-time, temporary faculty member has qualified for the negotiated provisions.
(B) A written agreement, confirming that provisions requiring the implementation of clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, have been included in a collective bargaining agreement in effect as of January 1, 2017, shall be signed by the exclusive representative for part-time, temporary faculty and the community college district, who are subject to that agreement, in order for the district to be exempt from this subdivision pursuant to subparagraph (A).
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Existing law authorizes the establishment of community college districts under the administration of community college governing boards, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at community college campuses throughout the state.
Existing law requires that a person employed to teach adult or community college classes for not more than 67% of the hours per week of a full-time employee having comparable duties, excluding substitute service, be classified as a temporary employee and not a contract employee.
This bill would require community college districts without a collective bargaining agreement with part-time, temporary faculty in effect as of January 1, 2017, to, on or after January 1, 2017, commence negotiations with the exclusive representatives for part-time, temporary faculty regarding the terms and conditions required by the bill. The bill would specify minimum standards for the treatment of part-time, temporary faculty to be met by community college collective bargaining agreements negotiated on or after January 1, 2017, that are not exempt, as specified. These standards would relate to, among other issues, evaluation procedures, workload distribution, and seniority rights.
To the extent that this bill would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 87482.3 to the Education Code, relating to community colleges."

13700.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) There are homeless minors living on the streets of major urban centers, suburban communities, and in rural areas in this state without adequate food, shelter, health care, or financial support.
(2) Many of these homeless youth in these urban centers come from out-of-city or out-of-county locations.
(3) The homeless child, in many instances, has a history of physical or sexual abuse at home, and of having been rejected or forced out of the parental home.
(4) While living on the streets, these youth fall prey to drug abuse, human trafficking, prostitution, and other illegal activities.
(5) Local public agencies are unable to provide these youth with an adequate level or range of remedial services.
(6) These homeless minors are urgently in need of specialized services to locate them, to assist them with their immediate survival needs, and to address their long-term need to reunite with their parents or find a suitable home.
(7) Two homeless youth emergency service pilot programs, one in the City of Los Angeles, and one in the City and County of San Francisco, have demonstrated the need for ongoing programs to meet the needs of homeless minors and the effectiveness of these programs in meeting these needs.
(8) While critical, immediate crisis intervention does not go far enough to help these youth make a successful transition to adulthood. Evidence supports transitional living programs as the key driver of positive outcomes for homeless youth.

SECTION 1.
Section 4030 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
4030.
(a) (1) The Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement policies and practices for conducting strip or body cavity searches of detained persons vary widely throughout California. Consequently, some people have been arbitrarily subjected to unnecessary strip and body cavity searches after arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction offenses. Some present search practices violate state and federal constitutional rights to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.
(b) The provisions of this section shall apply only to prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses and to any minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code alleged to have committed a misdemeanor or infraction offense. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person in the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

(2) An agency that utilizes a body scanner pursuant to this subdivision shall endeavor to avoid knowingly using a body scanner to scan a woman who is pregnant.
(e) A person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, or a minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, except for those minors alleged to have committed felonies or offenses involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail population, unless a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, to believe that person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband. A strip search or visual body cavity search, or both, shall not be conducted without the prior written authorization of the supervising officer on duty. The authorization shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.
(f) (1) Except pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2), a person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be confined in the general jail population unless all of the following are true:

(B) The person is not released on his or her own recognizance pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2.
(C) The person is not able to post bail within a reasonable time, not less than three hours.
(2) A person shall not be housed in the general jail population prior to release pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) unless a documented emergency exists and there is no reasonable alternative to that placement. The person shall be placed in the general population only upon prior written authorization documenting the specific facts and circumstances of the emergency. The written authorization shall be signed by the uniformed supervisor of the facility or by a uniformed watch commander. A person confined in the general jail population pursuant to paragraph (1) shall retain all rights to release on citation, his or her own recognizance, or bail that were preempted as a consequence of the emergency.
(g) A person arrested on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, or a minor described in subdivision (b), shall not be subjected to a physical body cavity search except under the authority of a search warrant issued by a magistrate specifically authorizing the physical body cavity search.
(h) A copy of the prior written authorization required by subdivisions (e) and (f) and the search warrant required by subdivision (g) shall be placed in the agency’s records and made available, on request, to the person searched or his or her authorized representative. With regard to a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search, the time, date, and place of the search, the name and sex of the person conducting the search, and a statement of the results of the search, including a list of items removed from the person searched, shall be recorded in the agency’s records and made available, upon request, to the person searched or his or her authorized representative.

Persons are considered to be participating in the search if their official duties relative to search procedure require them to be present at the time the search is conducted.
(m) A person who knowingly and willfully authorizes or conducts a strip search or visual or physical body cavity search in violation of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(n) This section does not limit the common law or statutory rights of a person regarding an action for damages or injunctive relief, or preclude the prosecution under another law of a peace officer or other person who has violated this section.
(o) Any person who suffers damage or harm as a result of a violation of this section may bring a civil action to recover actual damages, or one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is greater. In addition, the court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages, equitable relief as it deems necessary and proper, and costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees.","Existing law generally prohibits strip searches and body cavity searches of prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses. Existing law allows a person who has been arrested and taken into custody to be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell.
This bill would also allow law enforcement personnel to subject a person who is arrested and taken into custody to a body scanner search for those weapons or substances. The bill would require an agency utilizing a body scanner to endeavor to avoid knowingly using a body scanner to scan a woman who is pregnant. The bill would require a person within sight of the visual display of a body scanner depicting the body during a scan to be of the same sex as the person being scanned, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel.","An act to amend Section 4030 of the Penal Code, relating to jails."

(2) This offense is an infraction or a misdemeanor, subject to Sections 19.6, 19.7, and 19.8, if the person committing the offense is a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States.
(d) Any person who forges documentation reflecting the awarding of any military decoration that he or she has not received for the purposes of obtaining money, property, or receiving a tangible benefit is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(e) Any person who knowingly, with the intent to impersonate and to deceive, for the purposes of obtaining money, property, or receiving a tangible benefit, misrepresents himself or herself as a member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States, the California National Guard, the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia by wearing the uniform or military decoration authorized for use by the members or veterans of those forces, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law requires certain elected officers to forfeit their office upon the conviction of a crime pursuant to the federal Stolen Valor Act of 2005 that involves a false claim of receipt of any military decoration or medal, as specified, or the California Stolen Valor Act that involves a false claim, made with the intent to defraud, that the person is a veteran or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. Existing law, the federal Stolen Valor Act of 2013, prohibits a person, with the intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible property, from fraudulently holding oneself out to be a recipient of a military decoration or medal, as specified.
This bill would instead require these elected officers to forfeit their office upon the conviction of a crime pursuant to the federal Stolen Valor Act of 2013 or the California Stolen Valor Act that involves a fraudulent claim, made with the intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit, as defined, that the person is a veteran or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, as prescribed in those acts.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to falsely represent himself or herself as a veteran or member of the Armed Forces of the United States in connection with specified acts. Existing law provides that any person who, orally, in writing, or by wearing any military decoration, falsely represents himself or herself to have been awarded any military decoration, with the intent to defraud, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would conform those provisions to the federal Stolen Valor Act of 2013, and impose a misdemeanor only if the prescribed actions described above are made with the intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit, as defined. The bill would expand the above-described crime related
to
misrepresentation to
include
a person who falsely represents himself or herself as a veteran or member of other specified armed forces with the intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible

By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(b)Some advanced-technology light-duty vehicles require new infrastructure to enable convenient and cost-effective fueling, which can be a barrier to vehicle sales. This can include fueling infrastructure in homes, workplaces, and public spaces.
(c)Market penetration is slowed due to a lack of information for consumers on the benefits and availability of vehicles and the incentives available when they are ready to purchase or lease a vehicle.
(d)While the state has taken a leadership role to develop programs to assist the deployment of plug-in electric vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles in disadvantaged communities, any long-term plan designed by the state needs to address new and used car sales in disadvantaged communities.

The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes generally in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.
This bill would specify that this exemption does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes.
(3) The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, allow a credit under the Personal Income Tax Law in an amount equal to $2,500 to a qualified taxpayer, as defined, who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle during the taxable year. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide that the credit amount in excess of tax liability would be refundable in those years in which an appropriation for that purpose is made by the Legislature.
The Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows various deductions from gross income in computing adjusted gross income under that law, including deductions for payments to individual retirement accounts, alimony payments, and interest on educational loans.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, would allow a deduction of $2,500 in computing adjusted gross income to a qualified taxpayer, as defined, who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle during the taxable year, as provided.
This bill would require a qualified taxpayer to make an irrevocable election to either claim the above-described deduction or credit for the taxable year.
(4) This bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to make an annual report to the Legislature regarding the tax provisions allowed by the bill.","An act to add

SECTION 1.
Chapter 10.5 (commencing with Section 5845) is added to Division 5 of the Public Resources Code, to read:
CHAPTER  10.5. Lower American River Conservancy Program
5845.
This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Lower American River Conservancy Program Act.
5845.1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The Lower American River is one of California’s most important natural environments, providing recreational, environmental, and educational opportunities to more than 8,000,000 visitors each year. It also serves as a unique urban greenbelt composed of more than 5,000 acres and lying immediately next to and within two incorporated cities and the unincorporated County of Sacramento.
(2) The American River Parkway includes natural and recreational resources of statewide interest and is often referred to as “the jewel” of the Sacramento region, and it is managed as such with an intent to fulfill the vision set forth through past collaborative efforts involving advocates and stakeholders, the County of Sacramento, state agencies, and the Legislature.
(3) The American River Parkway was established by the County of Sacramento, with financial support from the state and other public and private entities.
(4) Since establishing the American River Parkway in 1959, the County of Sacramento has and will continue to update, maintain, and determine consistency with the American River Parkway Plan and to serve as the Parkway Manager to own, manage, operate, and patrol the lands and resources within the American River Parkway.
(5) The American River Parkway provides additional benefits to the state and the Sacramento region including flood control, water supply, water quality, habitat for anadromous fisheries, including salmon and steelhead, habitat for migratory waterfowl, habitat for sensitive species, including Swainson’s hawks, peregrine falcons, northern harriers, white-tailed kites, and western pond turtles, and habitat for other wildlife, including river otters.
(6) The Legislature recognized the statewide importance of the American River Parkway in enacting the Urban American River Parkway Preservation Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 5840)), which culminated with the adoption of the American River Parkway Plan and the Bushy Lake Preservation Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 5830)).
(7) The statewide and national importance of the Lower American River Parkway was further recognized when it was designated as part of the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The American River Parkway Plan acts as the management plan for the lower American River under the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Chapter 1.4 (commencing with Section 5093.50)), providing management guidance and direction for state departments and agencies, as well as local governments, in carrying out their responsibilities under that act.
(8) The state has an interest in working with local agencies to expand, enhance, and restore the natural, recreational, cultural, and educational resources in and adjacent to the American River Parkway.
(9) The establishment of the Lower American River Conservancy Program will provide a state partner to work cooperatively with local agencies, particularly the County of Sacramento in its role as the Parkway Manager, and nonprofit organizations to help fund projects and provide grants to restore, enhance, interpret, protect, and improve public access to the American River Parkway’s natural, recreational, educational, and cultural resources.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Lower American River Conservancy Program be a continuation of the state’s historic role in providing funding to advance the protection and restoration of the natural resources of the Lower American River while continuing the County of Sacramento’s historic role in managing the lands and public uses of the American River Parkway.

SECTION 1.
Section 368 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
368.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that crimes against elders and dependent adults are deserving of special consideration and protection, not unlike the special protections provided for minor children, because elders and dependent adults may be confused, on various medications, mentally or physically impaired, or incompetent, and therefore less able to protect themselves, to understand or report criminal conduct, or to testify in court proceedings on their own behalf.
(b) (1) Any person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult and who, under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully causes or permits any elder or dependent adult to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody of any elder or dependent adult, willfully causes or permits the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured, or willfully causes or permits the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation in which his or her person or health is endangered, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not to exceed six thousand dollars ($6,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years.

(e) Any caretaker of an elder or a dependent adult who violates any provision of law proscribing theft, embezzlement, forgery, or fraud, or who violates Section 530.5 proscribing identity theft, with respect to the property or personal identifying information of that elder or dependent adult, is punishable as follows:
(1) By a fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170
in the state prison
for two, three, or four years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, when the moneys, labor, goods, services, or real or personal property taken or obtained is of a value exceeding nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).
(2) By a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment, when the moneys, labor, goods, services, or real or personal property taken or obtained is of a value not exceeding nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).

The court shall take into consideration the ability of the defendant to pay, and no defendant shall be denied probation because of his or her inability to pay.
(l) Upon conviction for a violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f), the sentencing court shall also consider issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim, which may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court. It is the intent of the Legislature that the length of any restraining order be based upon the seriousness of the facts before the court, the probability of future violations, and the safety of the victim and his or her immediate family. This protective order may be issued by the court whether the defendant is sentenced to state prison or county jail, or if imposition of sentence is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation.","Existing law makes it a crime for

punishable as a misdemeanor in county jail or as a felony in state prison, as prescribed.","An act to amend Section 368 of the Penal Code, relating to elder abuse."
901,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) To remain economically competitive, California will need to produce 11,900,000 degrees and credentials by 2025, but the state is only estimated to produce 9,500,000, which would create a degree and credential attainment gap of 2,400,000 by 2025.
(2) California’s community colleges have strong transfer preparation and career technical education missions and are well positioned to close this impending gap.
(3) Overall, only 32 percent of students at California colleges complete credentials on time, and low-income students are much less likely than higher income students to enroll in or complete college.
(4) A major factor in a student’s enrollment and success in college is his or her ability to pay for fees and tuition, textbooks, transportation, housing, food, and other access costs.
(5) California has made an important investment in need-based financial aid for California’s college students through the Cal Grant Program and the BOG Fee Waiver Program of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges.
(6) The Cal Grant Program awards more than two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) annually, and it is the largest state grant program in the nation in terms of dollars awarded to students. The BOG Fee Waiver Program is more extensive than any other “free community college” plan in the nation, and it provides almost one-half of all students of the California Community Colleges, and more than 60 percent of full-time students of the California Community Colleges, with free tuition.
(7) Despite California’s strong commitment to financial aid, access grants for qualifying students are insufficient to cover nontuition college costs, and many low-income students are left out of the program entirely.
(8) Students at California’s community colleges are disproportionately more likely to be the first in their family to attend college, come from an immigrant background, or be financially needy.
(9) After taking into account the total cost of attendance and all federal, state, and institutional financial aid available for students, on average it is more expensive for a needy student to go to a California community college than to attend the University of California or the California State University.
(10) The affordability challenge faced by California’s community college students stems from nontuition costs, and the solution to that challenge is to increase grant aid that covers nontuition costs.
(11) The 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education in California guarantees an affordable, high-quality education to every Californian who can benefit.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to renew California’s commitment to college affordability by increasing the aid available to needy students, and, specifically, broadening access to financial aid to students enrolled in California community
college career technical education programs leading to industry valued credentials, through expanding the Cal Grant Program.
colleges.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that California community colleges provide outreach and education to students to inform them of the expanded availability of financial aid
for students enrolled in career technical education programs
and to encourage
these
students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid by the September 2 deadline.

Section 69437 of the Education Code is amended to read:
69437.
(a) Commencing with the 2001–02 academic year, and each academic year thereafter, there shall be established the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 69434), Article 3 (commencing with Section 69435), or Article 4 (commencing with Section 69436). Awards made under this section are not entitlements. The submission of an application by a student under this section shall not entitle that student to an award. The selection of students under this article shall be determined pursuant to subdivision (c) and other relevant criteria established by the commission.
(b)  Commencing with the 2016–17 academic year, a total of up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards shall be granted annually under this article on a competitive basis for applicants who meet the general eligibility criteria established in Article 1 (commencing with Section 69430) and the priorities established by the commission pursuant to subdivision (c).
(1) Fifteen thousand of the awards referenced in this subdivision are available to all students, including California community college students, who meet the financial need and academic requirements established pursuant to this article. A student enrolling at a qualifying baccalaureate degree granting institution shall apply by the March 2 deadline. A California community college student is eligible to apply at the March 2 or the September 2 deadline.
(2) Nineteen thousand of the awards referenced in this subdivision are reserved for students who will be enrolled at a California community college. The commission shall establish a second application deadline of September 2 for community college students to apply for these awards.
Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 69435, effective with the fall term or semester of the 2017–18 academic year, students enrolled in occupational or technical training courses leading to industry valued credentials of no less than four months in length at a California community college shall be eligible for Cal Grant B awards issued under this paragraph.
(3) If any awards are not distributed pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) upon initial allocation of the awards under this article, the commission shall make awards to as many eligible students as possible, beginning with the students with the lowest expected family contribution and highest academic merit, consistent with the criteria adopted by the commission pursuant to subdivision (c), as practicable without exceeding an annual cumulative total of 34,000 awards.
(c) (1) On or before February 1, 2001, acting pursuant to a public hearing process that is consistent with the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the commission shall establish selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards under the competitive program that give special consideration to disadvantaged students, taking into consideration those financial, educational, cultural, language, home, community, environmental, and other conditions that hamper a student’s access to, and ability to persist in, postsecondary education programs.
(2) Additional consideration shall be given to both of the following:
(A) Students pursuing Cal Grant B awards who reestablish their grade point averages.
(B) Students who did not receive awards pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 69434), Article 3 (commencing with Section 69435), or Article 4 (commencing with Section 69436).
(d) All other students who meet the eligibility requirements pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 69430) are eligible to compete for an award pursuant to this article.

(2)“Economic security” has the same meaning as set forth in Section 14005 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
(3)“Industry cluster” has the same meaning as set forth in Section 88620.
(4)“Long-term unemployed” means, with respect to an award applicant, a person who has been unemployed for more than 26 weeks at the time of submission to the commission of his or her application.
(5)“Occupational or technical training” means that phase of education coming after the completion of a secondary school program and leading toward recognized occupational goals approved by the commission.

There shall be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were paid in the 2015–16 fiscal year. The maximum award amount and the total amount of funding shall be determined each year in the annual Budget Act.
(c)The commission may use criteria it deems appropriate in selecting students to receive grants for occupational or technical training and shall give special consideration to the social and economic situations of the students applying for these grants, giving additional weight to disadvantaged applicants, applicants who face economic hardship, and applicants who face particular barriers to employment. Criteria to be considered for these purposes shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:
(1)Family income and household size.
(2)Student’s or the students’ parent’s household status, including whether the student is a single parent or child of a single parent.
(3)The employment status of the applicant and whether the applicant is unemployed, giving greater weight to the long-term unemployed.
(d)The Cal Grant C award recipients shall be eligible for renewal of their grants until they have completed their occupational or technical training in conformance with terms prescribed by the commission. A determination by the commission for a subsequent award year that the program under which a Cal Grant C award was initially awarded is no longer deemed to receive priority shall not affect an award recipient’s renewal. In no case shall the grants exceed two calendar years.
(e)Cal Grant C awards may be used for institutional fees, charges, and other costs, including tuition, plus training-related costs, such as special clothing, local transportation, required tools, equipment, supplies, books, and living expenses. In determining the individual award amounts, the commission shall take into account the financial means available to the student to fund his or her course of study and costs of attendance as well as other state and federal programs available to the applicant.
(f)(1)To ensure alignment with the state’s dynamic economic needs, the commission, in consultation with appropriate state and federal agencies, including the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the California Workforce Investment Board, shall identify areas of occupational and technical training for which students may utilize Cal Grant C awards. The commission, to the extent feasible, shall also consult with representatives of the state’s leading competitive and emerging industry clusters, workforce professionals, and career technical educators, to determine which occupational training programs and industry clusters should be prioritized.
(2)(A)Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the areas of occupational and technical training developed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be regularly reviewed and updated at least every five years, beginning in 2012.
(B)By January 1, 2016, the commission shall update the priority areas of occupational and technical training.
(3)(A)The commission shall give priority in granting Cal Grant C awards to students pursuing occupational or technical training in areas that meet two of the following criteria pertaining to job quality:
(i)High employer need or demand for the specific skills offered in the program.
(ii)High employment growth in the occupational field or industry cluster for which the student is being trained.
(iii)High employment salary and wage projections for workers employed in the occupations for which they are being trained.

(B)To receive priority pursuant to subparagraph (A), at least one of the criteria met shall be specified in clause (iii) or (iv) of that subparagraph.
(g)The commission shall determine areas of occupational or technical training that meet the criteria described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f) in consultation with the Employment Development Department, the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, and the California Workforce Investment Board using projections available through the Labor Market Information Data Library. The commission may supplement the analyses of the Employment Development Department’s Labor Market Information Data Library with the labor market analyses developed by the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the California Workforce Investment Board, as well as the projections of occupational shortages and skills gap developed by industry leaders. The commission shall publish, and retain, on its Internet Web site a current list of the areas of occupational or technical training that meet the criteria described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f), and update this list as necessary.
(h)Using the best available data, the commission shall examine the graduation rates and job placement data, or salary data, of eligible programs. Commencing with the 2014–15 academic year, the commission shall give priority to Cal Grant C award applicants seeking to enroll in programs that rate high in graduation rates and job placement data, or salary data.
(i)(1)The commission shall consult with the Employment Development Department, the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the California Workforce Investment Board, and the local workforce investment boards to develop a plan to publicize the existence of the grant award program to California’s long-term unemployed to be used by those consulting agencies when they come in contact with members of the population who are likely to be experiencing long-term unemployment. The outreach plan shall use existing administrative and service delivery processes making use of existing points of contact with the long-term unemployed. The local workforce investment boards are required to participate only to the extent that the outreach efforts are a part of their existing responsibilities under the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-220).
(2)The commission shall consult with the Workforce Services Branch of the Employment Development Department, the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the California Workforce Investment Board, and the local workforce investment boards to develop a plan to make students receiving awards aware of job search and placement services available through the Employment Development Department and the local workforce investment boards. Outreach shall use existing administrative and service delivery processes making use of existing points of contact with the students. The local workforce investment boards are required to participate only to the extent that the outreach efforts are a part of their existing responsibilities under the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-220).
(j)(1)Notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the Legislative Analyst’s Office shall submit a report to the Legislature on the outcomes of the Cal Grant C program on or before April 1, 2015, and on or before April 1 of each odd-numbered year thereafter. This report shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, information on all of the following:
(A)The age, gender, and segment of attendance for recipients in two prior award years.
(B)The occupational and technical training program categories prioritized.
(C)The number and percentage of students who received selection priority as defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f).
(D)The extent to which recipients in these award years were successfully placed in jobs that meet local, regional, or state workforce needs.
(2)For the report due on or before April 1, 2015, the Legislative Analyst’s Office shall include data for two additional prior award years and shall compare the mix of occupational and technical training programs and institutions in which Cal Grant C award recipients enrolled before and after implementation of subdivision (f).

This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to renew California’s commitment to college affordability by increasing the aid available to needy students, and, specifically, broadening access to financial aid to students enrolled in California community
college career technical education programs leading to industry valued credentials, through expanding the Cal Grant Program.
colleges.
(2) Under existing law, no more than a total of 25,750 Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards may be granted annually.
This bill, commencing with the 2016–17 academic year, would raise that limit to 34,000.
The bill would, effective with the fall term or semester of the 2017–18 academic year, make students enrolled in occupational or technical training courses leading to industry valued credentials of no less than 4 months in length at a California community college eligible for Cal Grant B awards under an existing allocation reserved for community college students, notwithstanding an existing requirement that limits Cal Grant B awards to for-credit instructional programs that are not less than one academic year in length.
(3)Existing law requires a Cal Grant C award to be utilized only for occupational or technical training in a course of not less than 4 months. Existing law requires that there be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were made in the 2000–01 fiscal year.
This bill instead would require that there be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were paid in the 2015–16 fiscal year.","An act to amend

903,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1)
A new form of work has proliferated in which individuals work by the job through an electronic platform, such as the Internet or telephone. These individuals are hired through these hosting platforms to perform short-term work, usually of a day or less, for multiple customers.
(2)
These individuals are not treated by the hosting platforms as employees and do not receive the benefit of state labor protection laws such as minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and workers’ compensation. The platforms treat these individuals as independent contractors and even though they perform work for multiple clients, usually individual people, the individuals securing work through a hosting platform are normally prohibited from negotiating the terms of their services. Instead, the hosting platforms dictate the terms and take a considerable portion of the amount paid for services, even though the hosting platforms purport that they provide only a means of connecting workers with clients.
(3)
These are circumstances that inevitably lead to exploitation. The people who secure work through the hosting platforms may in fact be employees, but establishing their true status often requires lengthy and expensive litigation during the pendency of which they continue to have no protection.
(b)
The Legislature therefore finds and declares that the bargaining power between the hosting platforms and the people seeking work through them must be better balanced and creates in this act a process for these workers to get together and negotiate with the hosting platforms for the improvements they desire.
(c) The Legislature further finds and declares that, through these negotiations, these workers will be able to improve their conditions, including their income, to the benefit of the economy of this state and reduce pressure on public resources.
SECTION 1.

Chapter 4.8 (commencing with Section 1080) is added to Part 3 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, to read:
CHAPTER  4.8. Hosting Platforms
1080.
As used in this chapter:
(a) “Group activity” means to self-organize, to negotiate as a group with one or more hosting platforms, or to engage together in other activities for the purpose of group negotiations or other mutual aid or protection, which activity includes, but is not limited, to the following:
(1) Communicating with each other and with hosting platforms, customers, and the public through any medium, including, but not limited to, social media and other electronic modes of communication.
(2) Withholding or restricting the amount of work done through a hosting platform at any time and for any duration. This paragraph does not apply to an independent contractor who performs “supportive services,” as defined in Section 12300.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(3) Boycotting or critiquing a hosting platform’s business practices.
(4) Reporting to law enforcement authorities or making public practices of a hosting platform which an independent contractor reasonably believes violate local, state, or federal law and adversely affect either workers or clients, or both.
(b) “Hosting platform” is a facility for connecting people or entities seeking to hire people for work with people seeking to perform that work, using any medium of facilitation, including, but not limited to, a dispatch service, an Internet Web site, or other Internet-based site. “Hosting platform” does not include a service provider if that entity provides only listings of goods or services that are contracted directly between buyers and sellers without the involvement of the provider and receives no income related to the price of the transaction.
1081.
(a) An independent contractor who is not treated by a hosting platform as an employee and who does not employ his or her own employees shall have the right to engage in group activity with respect to one or more hosting platforms.
(b) Work by an independent contractor, including the use of equipment or goods supplied as part of the work performed by the independent contractor, is labor within the meaning of Section 16703 of the Business and Professions Code and group activity by independent contractors shall not be subject to any statutory or common law prohibition or limitation on combinations in restraint of trade, including, but not limited to, Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 16700) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.
(c) Group activity is a “labor dispute” within the meaning of Section 527.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 1138.1, provided that a court may issue injunctive relief to remedy violations of this chapter pursuant to
Sections ____ and ____.
subdivisions (e) and (g).
(d) (1) A hosting platform shall meet at reasonable times and negotiate in good faith about allowed subjects for negotiation with any group of independent contractors constituting at least 10 of the independent contractors using the platform on an average of at least once per week. As used in this paragraph, “allowed subjects for negotiation” are pricing, division of revenue, priority for assignments or listings, advertising by independent contractors on the hosting platform, insurance, acceptance and termination of independent contractor participation on the hosting platform, acceptance or refusal of services by independent contractors or customers, and responsibility for nonpayment by customers.
(2) An individual or organization that represents independent contractors in negotiations with a hosting platform regarding the allowed subjects of negotiation pursuant to this section shall not be funded directly or indirectly by a hosting platform.
(3) Participation in the group shall be evidenced by an electronic communication from an independent contractor using the same address the independent contractor uses to communicate with the hosting platform, or a physical document signed by the independent contractor, sent to either the hosting platform or to one or more other members of the group accepting participation in the group and agreeing to be bound contractually by the outcome of any negotiations between the group and the hosting platform. An independent contractor shall not be bound by the outcome of any negotiations between a group and a hosting platform unless the independent contractor has given that authorization.
(4) At the request of the group, a written contract for independent contractor services, entered into on or after the date of the conclusion of negotiations conducted in accordance with paragraph (1), between the hosting platform and a member of that group, shall incorporate any agreement reached in those negotiations.
(e) The State Mediation and Conciliation Service shall facilitate the performance of the obligation of a hosting platform under subdivision (d). The State Mediation and Conciliation Service shall provide meeting space for negotiations unless the hosting platform and the group make other arrangements that are mutually agreeable. The State Mediation and Conciliation Service shall provide mediation services at the request of either the hosting platform or the group. The State Mediation and Conciliation Service shall investigate any complaint by a group claiming a violation of subdivision (d), and, if it finds that there is probable cause to believe a violation has occurred, bring an action in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief to remedy the violation. The court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the State Mediation and Conciliation Service if it prevails in any enforcement action.
(f) A person shall not terminate, discriminate against, or otherwise penalize or retaliate against any independent contractor for exercising any rights established in this chapter or for making a complaint, participating in any enforcement proceedings under this chapter, using any civil remedies to enforce his or her rights, or otherwise asserting his or her rights under this chapter or demonstrating his or her support for the policies of this chapter. A person terminating or taking any other adverse action against any independent contractor who has engaged in any of the foregoing activities within one year preceding the termination or other adverse action shall provide to the independent contractor at or before the time of the termination or other adverse action a detailed written statement of the reason or reasons for the termination or other adverse action, including all the facts substantiating the reason or reasons and all facts known to the person that contradict the substantiating facts.

If the director sells property under this section, that property shall be sold at its fair market value to the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 for resale and use in the development of residential and commercial properties consistent with the Capitol Area Plan. In addition, any property sold under this section shall not diminish the number of existing dwelling units or subsequently developed units that are required to be made available to low-income households pursuant to Section 8193. For the purposes of Section 8193, an existing residential dwelling unit or a subsequently developed unit located on land sold pursuant to this section shall continue to be included in the determination of the total number of dwelling units located on property leased by the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4.
(2)The director shall not sell any existing residential properties pursuant to this subdivision that are under the management of the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 unless that sale is part of an overall development plan that will lead to a net increase in residential units on the affected site or sites.
(3)In addition, the director shall not sell any existing residential properties pursuant to this subdivision that are under the management of the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 unless a deed restriction is recorded against the properties that contains an express condition and covenant that the real property conveyed shall be used only for residential purposes for a period of at least 45 years. “Residential purposes” means the same or substantially similar multifamily, single-family, or condominium use, or a mixed use, with the same or greater number of residential units on the affected site.

(g)All leases of state-owned property in the core area to any private person for other than parking shall be subject to possessory interest taxes in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 101) of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares each of the following:
(a) There is a compelling need for additional resources to be applied at the local level for the purpose of ensuring public safety.
(b) The Los Angeles Times stated on November 10, 2015, that “A Times review found that property crime has increased in nine of California’s 10 largest cities so far this year compared with the same period last year. Violent crime was up in all 10.”
(c) The state’s criminal justice realignment and Proposition 47 of 2014, the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,” have also placed new burdens on local law enforcement.
(d) Rising crime rates, coupled with a growing state population, and rising inflation have placed significant pressure on local law enforcement budgets. Funding for local law enforcement programs has not kept pace with statewide growth in population or inflation. What was once funding of $489.9 million has increased to $549.1 million. However, based on increases in the State Appropriations Limit since fiscal year 2006–07, funding should be 28.82 percent higher, or $631.1 million, which is $85 million above current levels. This funding should be proportionally available to all communities and should be distributed consistent with the current percentage distribution schedule established by the Department of Finance for the Citizens’ Option for Public Safety (COPS) program.
(e) Many California communities are plagued by gang violence, drug addiction, and violence associated with drug use and drug trafficking.
(f) A letter dated December 21, 2015, from the United States Department of Justice stated that, for the foreseeable future, the department would be halting equitable funding payments to state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners. For California law enforcement agencies this will result in approximately $85 million in lost revenue.
(g) Accordingly, it is the intent of the Legislature to establish a new program to provide additional funding for front-line law enforcement services, particularly those focused on drug interdiction, antigang enforcement, and other local law enforcement and crime prevention-related activities.

Moneys allocated to the county pursuant to this subdivision shall be retained in the county SLESA, and moneys allocated to a city pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited an SLESA established in the city treasury.
(c) Funds received pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be expended or encumbered in accordance with this chapter no later than June 30 of the following fiscal year.
30067.

Section 4.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1577. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after AB 1577, in which case Section 4 of this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 6.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing federal law provides for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Existing state law authorizes a county to deliver CalFresh benefits through the use of an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system. Existing federal law authorizes counties to participate in the Restaurant Meals Program.
This bill would require each public and private postsecondary educational institution that is located in a county that participates in the Restaurant Meals Program to apply to become an approved food vendor for the program, if the institution operates any qualifying food facilities on campus, or to provide contracting food vendors with specified information about the program. By imposing these requirements on community colleges, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services, if private nonprofit organizations are successful in raising money for CalFresh outreach activities and have secured a local governmental agency to serve as the contracting agency, upon request and subject to approval by the United States Department of Agriculture, to act as their state entity for the receipt of matching funds.
This bill would additionally require the department to act as the state entity for the receipt of federal reimbursement for CalFresh outreach activities on behalf of state educational institutions or other state or local agencies, subject to certain conditions.
(3) Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and administer the State Emergency Food Assistance Program, to provide food and funding for the provision of emergency food to food banks, as provided. Existing law creates the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account within the Emergency Food Assistance Program Fund and requires that moneys in the account, upon appropriation by the Legislature, be used by the program for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California and for the department’s administrative costs.
This bill would establish the Public Higher Education Pantry Assistance Program Account in the Emergency Food Assistance Program Fund, and would require that moneys in the account, upon appropriation by the Legislature, be allocated to the department for allocation to food banks that support on-campus pantry and hunger relief efforts serving low-income students, as specified.
(4) This bill would incorporate changes to Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1577, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 66025.93 to the Education Code, and to amend Sections 18904.3 and 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to food assistance."

(i) “Offering price” is the amount expressed in dollars specified in an offer to purchase for which the buyer is willing to buy the real property.
(j) “Offer to purchase” means a written contract executed by a buyer acting through a selling agent that becomes the contract for the sale of the real property upon acceptance by the seller.
(k) “Real property” means any estate specified by subdivision (1) or (2) of Section 761 in property that constitutes or is improved with one to four dwelling units, any commercial real property, any leasehold in these types of property exceeding one year’s duration, and mobilehomes, when offered for sale or sold through an agent pursuant to the authority contained in Section 10131.6 of the Business and Professions Code.
(l) “Real property transaction” means a transaction for the sale of real property in which an agent is employed by one or more of the principals to act in that transaction, and includes a listing or an offer to purchase.
(m) “Sell,” “sale,” or “sold” refers to a transaction for the transfer of real property from the seller to the buyer, and includes exchanges of real property between the seller and buyer, transactions for the creation of a real property sales contract within the meaning of Section 2985, and transactions for the creation of a leasehold exceeding one year’s duration.
(n) “Seller” means the transferor in a real property transaction, and includes an owner who lists real property with an agent, whether or not a transfer results, or who receives an offer to purchase real property of which he or she is the owner from an agent on behalf of another. “Seller” includes both a vendor and a lessor.
(o) “Selling agent” means a listing agent who acts alone, or an agent who acts in cooperation with a listing agent, and who sells or finds and obtains a buyer for the real property, or an agent who locates property for a buyer or who finds a buyer for a property for which no listing exists and presents an offer to purchase to the seller.
(p) “Subagent” means a person to whom an agent delegates agency powers as provided in Article 5 (commencing with Section 2349) of Chapter 1 of Title 9. However, “subagent” does not include an associate licensee who is acting under the supervision of an agent in a real property transaction.","Existing law defines various terms for the purposes of some, but not all, provisions relating to the duty owed to the prospective purchaser in transactions of commercial and residential real estate, including, but not limited to, the terms “agent,” “buyer,” “real property,” “sell,” “sale,” “sold,” and “seller.”
This bill would specify that those definitions also apply to a provision relating to the duty to inform the prospective purchaser of specified property of common environmental hazards.","An act to amend Section 2079.13 of the Civil Code, relating to real property transactions."

SECTION 1.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify that pawnbrokers and other secondhand dealers are to report their acquisition of tangible personal property received in pledge, trade, consignment, or auction or by purchase using plain text, in descriptive language historically used in the pawn and secondhand industries when reporting to the single, statewide, and uniform electronic reporting system operated by the Department of Justice, or if not yet implemented in their respective jurisdictions, on paper forms sent to the local police chief or sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the secondhand dealer is physically located.
(b) It is further the intent of the Legislature that by specifying this manner of reporting, it will relieve all secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers of the inherent costs and burdens imposed under existing law that requires these businesses to report their daily acquisitions of secondhand tangible personal property on paper forms limited to a single transaction, or where the electronic reporting system is implemented, the cost associated with converting industry standard descriptions to specific law enforcement categories, the ongoing costs of training to that standard, and the costs of implementing software to maintain that standard.
(c) Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Department of Justice shall continue to accept the plain text descriptive language historically used in the pawn and secondhand industries and may provide article field descriptors to secondhand dealers in order to facilitate communication between the single, statewide, and uniform electronic reporting system and law enforcement databases. It is the intent of the Legislature that only properly trained law enforcement personnel of the Department of Justice or local law enforcement classify and encode for law enforcement databases property reported by pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers.

(D) For the purpose of this paragraph, “handheld electronic device” means any portable device that is capable of creating, receiving, accessing, or storing electronic data or communications and includes, but is not limited to, a cellular phone, smartphone, or tablet.
(4) A certification by the intended seller or pledger that he or she is the owner of the property or has the authority of the owner to sell or pledge the property.
(5) A certification by the intended seller or pledger that to his or her knowledge and belief the information is true and complete.
(6) A legible fingerprint taken from the intended seller or pledger, as prescribed by the Department of Justice. This requirement does not apply to a coin dealer, unless required pursuant to local regulation.
(7) A report submitted by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Department of Justice if a good faith effort has been made to supply all of the required information. An error or omission on the report shall be noted, and the reporting pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be notified of the error or omission by the Department of Justice. A reporting pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall have three business days from that notice to amend or correct the report before being subject to any enforcement violation.

(d) (1) The Department of Justice shall recognize and accept the properly spelled and non-abbreviated plain text property descriptors generally accepted in the pawn and secondhand industries provided by pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers, as has been the longstanding practice of chiefs of police and sheriffs when they had received paper reports from pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers.
(2) A report required of a secondhand dealer pursuant to this section shall be transmitted by electronic means to CAPSS by the secondhand dealer.
(3) Unless specifically identified in this section, the Department of Justice, chiefs of police, and sheriffs shall not require a secondhand dealer to include any additional information concerning the seller, the pledger, or the property received by the secondhand dealer in the report required by this section.

SEC. 9.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to protect the public from the dissemination of stolen property, make the single, statewide, uniform electronic system a cost savings for secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers, and to require the plain text property descriptions historically utilized by these industries to be accepted by the Department of Justice, just as these plain text descriptions have historically been accepted by chiefs of police and sheriffs, at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.","Existing law regulates secondhand dealers and coin dealers, and makes it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of a secondhand dealer without a license issued by the chief of police, the sheriff, or, where appropriate, the police commission. Existing law also regulates pawnbrokers. Existing law requires a local law enforcement agency to issue a license to engage in the business of a sehe bill would require the Department of Justice to accept the properly spelled and non-abbreviated plain text property descriptions commonly recognized and utilized by the pawn and secondhand dealer industries. The bill would require a secondhand dealer to provide a property description in an article field descriptor, as specified. This bill would prohibit the Department of Justice, chiefs of police, and sheriffs from requiring secondhand dealers to report any additional information other than that which is required by these provisions. The bill would require that a future change to the reporting requirements of CAPSS that substantively alters the reporting standards be implemented and operated in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and prohibit the Department of Justice from taking any action with respect to the implementation, operation, or maintenance of CAPSS by adoption of an emergency regulation. The bill would also require the Department of Justice to convene a meeting with the Department of Technology to discuss issues pertaining to any proposed changes or upgrades, and authorize the Department of Technology to provide technological assistance for ongoing improvements, updates, or changes, to CAPSS.
Existing law provides an exception to the reporting requirement for the acquisition of the same property from the same customer within 12 months of a reported transfer, except when submission of the report is specifically requested in writing by the local authorities.
This bill would expand the reporting requirement exception to all acquisitions of the same property from the same customer within 12 months of a reported transfer.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 21628 and 21642.5 of, to add Section 21627.5 to, to repeal Sections 21628.1 and 21633 of, and to repeal and add Section 21630 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to secondhand goods, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."
912,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California has the highest number of older adults compared to any other state in the nation, with 4.2 million individuals over 65 years of age counted in the 2010 census.
(b) Elderly and dependent adults are seen as easy targets by financial predators who take advantage of their victims’ loneliness, isolation, and vulnerability. This population often falls victim to scams
such as
including
foreign lotteries, the sale of costly and ineffective annuities, identity theft, reverse mortgage scams, and fraudulent home repairs. Financial abuse is also committed by family members or caregivers who take advantage of an elder’s isolation and dependence.
(c) A 1998 study reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that an elder victimized by financial abuse has a decreased projected lifespan when compared to elders who have not suffered that exploitation.
(d) The State Department of Social Services reports that as many as 1,600 reports of elder and dependent adult financial abuse are under investigation per month by Adult Protective Services offices statewide.
(e) The California Victims of Crime Program does not serve this population even though federal law allows Victims of Crime Act funds to be used to do so. Federal guidelines identify elders and dependent adults as being underserved in this area.
(f) Many states already provide assistance to victims of financial crimes, including Colorado, Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wyoming.
(g) Elderly and dependent adult victims who lack the means to recover or replace misappropriated assets or property often suffer severe consequences including failing health; severe anxiety, depression, and hopelessness; and dependence on public assistance. Research has shown the benefits of mental health and financial counseling in helping these victims remain independent and regain the confidence to take perpetrators to court.
(h) A pilot program is needed to provide the Legislature with data on the demand for victim services, including mental health and financial counseling, by this population and the costs and outcomes of these services. The collection of this data could further help the state track the types and frequency of financial crimes against elder and dependent adults, identify services that are most needed by victims and the rates at which these services are utilized, and establish best practice protocols for serving these victims.
(i) The County of San Diego is well-situated to provide victims of elder and dependent adult financial abuse with access to services, including mental health and financial counseling.

Article 7 (commencing with Section 13967) is added to Chapter 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
Article  7. San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program
13967.
(a) The San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program is hereby established.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 13955, and except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c), a person who meets the requirements listed in subdivision (a) of Section 13955, shall be eligible for compensation under subdivision (d) if he or she was a victim of a violation of subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 368 of the Penal Code, and the crime occurred in the County of San Diego.
(c) A person shall not be eligible for compensation pursuant to subdivision (b) if he or she is a derivative victim and the only crime the victim suffered is elder or dependent adult abuse described in subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 368 of the Penal Code.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 13957, the board may grant for pecuniary loss, upon appropriation by the Legislature before January 1, 2019, if the board determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation to reimburse the expense of financial counseling, mental health counseling, or supportive services for a victim of a crime described in subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 368 of the Penal Code or financial abuse as defined by Section 15610.30 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, that occurred in the County of San Diego, as follows, up to a total of not more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) per person:
(1) The cost of not more than 10 sessions of financial counseling provided by a financial counselor, as described in the Victims of Crime Act Victim Compensation Grant Program (66 F.R. 27158-01), or an adviser providing services such as analysis of a victim’s financial situation, including income-producing capacity and crime-related financial obligations, assistance with restructuring budget and debt, assistance in accessing insurance, public assistance, and other benefits, and assistance in completing the financial aspects of victim impact statements.
(2) The cost of not more than 10 sessions of mental health counseling.
(e) Compensation pursuant to subdivision (d) shall not exceed an aggregate total of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for all persons compensated pursuant to the San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program.
(f) This section shall become inoperative on January 1, 2020.
13967.1.
(a) On or before July 1, 2020, the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board shall report to the Legislature and Governor all of the following:
(1) The number of victims who received payments pursuant to this article.
(2) The number of victims who received mental health counseling.
(3) The average payment for mental health counseling per recipient.
(4) The number of victims who received financial counseling.
(5) The average payment for financial counseling per recipient.
(6) Any other data on the pilot program that the board wishes to include.
(b) A report to be submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.
13967.5.
This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the County of San Diego where a high number of reported elder and dependent adult financial abuse crimes occur. The County of San Diego is well-suited for a pilot program that would allow the Legislature to gather data on the demand for victim services, including mental health and financial counseling, by elderly and dependent adult victims of financial crimes so as to effectively develop policies and resources for this underserved population.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law provides for the compensation of victims and derivative victims of specified types of crimes by the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for specified losses suffered as a result of those crimes. Existing law sets forth eligibility requirements and specified limits on the amount of compensation the board may award, and requires applications for compensation to be verified under penalty of perjury.
This bill would create the San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program and would authorize the board, upon appropriation by the Legislature before January 1, 2019, to provide victims of elder or dependent adult financial abuse compensation to reimburse costs for financial counseling, mental health counseling, or supportive services, as specified, if the crime occurred in the County of San Diego. The bill would limit compensation pursuant to this authorization to $3,000 per person and an aggregate total of $1,000,000. The bill would exclude a derivative victim from eligibility for compensation if the only crime the victim suffered was elder or dependent adult financial abuse. The bill would authorize the pilot program to operate until January 1, 2020. The bill would require the board to report specified information related to the pilot program to the Legislature and Governor on or before July 1, 2020. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
This bill would make related legislative findings and declarations, including findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute enacting a pilot program in the County of San Diego.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add and repeal Article 7 (commencing with Section 13967) to Chapter 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to crime victims."
913,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Modified hydrofluoric acid, a solution of hydrogen fluoride and water, is used by two refineries in California to manufacture high octane fuel.
(b) According to the United States Chemical Safety Board, “Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most hazardous and deadly chemicals used in petroleum refining.”
(c) In February 2015, an explosion at the Exxon Mobil Torrance refinery blanketed nearby neighborhoods with catalyst dust and felt like a 1.7 magnitude earthquake. The explosion nearly missed the Torrance refinery’s storage of modified hydrofluoric acid.
(d) Investigations have shown that since 1979 there have been more than 80 incidents at the Torrance refinery involving hydrofluoric acid.
(e) According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Hydrogen fluoride gas, even at low levels, can irritate the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract. Breathing in hydrogen fluoride at high levels or in combination with skin contact can cause death from an irregular heartbeat or from fluid buildup in the lungs.”
(f) People who survive after being severely injured by breathing in hydrogen fluoride may suffer lingering chronic lung disease or prolonged or permanent visual defects, blindness, or the total destruction of the eye.
(g) Residents in southern California have tried to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at refineries for more than 25 years.
(h) Previous attempts to ban hydrofluoric acid at refineries in California have ended in litigation. Notably, in 1991, Ultramar, the then-operator of the Wilmington refinery sued the South Coast Air Quality Management District after the district adopted a rule phasing out the use of hydrofluoric acid.
(i) Today, 616,000 residents in California live within 3.5 miles of refineries that combined store more than 60,000 lbs of modified hydrofluoric acid.
(j) Article I of the California Constitution declares, “All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.”
(k) Even in its modified form, hydrofluoric acid could kill more than 500,000 Californians at any moment, causing a threat to property and safety.

Article  11.3. Hydrogen Fluoride
25240.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Hydrogen fluoride, a highly toxic and highly corrosive mineral acid used in the manufacture of unleaded gasoline and refrigerants, is a harmful and potentially deadly toxic gas.
(b) If released, hydrogen fluoride creates a deadly gas cloud that is toxic to the respiratory system. Inhalation of hydrogen fluoride gas can result in irritation, inflammation, bronchiolar ulceration, pulmonary hemorrhage and edema, and death.
(c) Hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid pose significantly greater risks than sulfuric acid, an alternative chemical that can be substituted in the manufacture of unleaded gasoline.
(d) An uncontrolled release of hydrogen fluoride would endanger human life and health over an area six times as large as a comparable release of sulfuric acid. A hydrogen fluoride spill that was 90 percent controlled would endanger human life outside of the spill site, while no similar threat would exist from a spill of sulfuric acid. Tests have shown that a worst case spill of liquid hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid could produce a cloud that could be lethal for five miles downwind. Under normal spill conditions, sulfuric acid does not vaporize to form a dangerous cloud.
(e) Unforeseeable and unpreventable accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride could occur in several instances, including earthquake, mechanical or structural defects in equipment, human error, sabotage, and, in locations with considerable air traffic, aircraft disasters.
(f) The storage, transport, and use of hydrogen fluoride introduces the potential for serious public health risks. Chemical alternatives are available and should be used as an alternative to hydrogen fluoride to reduce the possibility of public endangerment.
25240.2.
(a) A business that, at any time, handles, maintains, or stores more than 250 gallons of hydrogen fluoride, including hydrofluoric acid, shall, if possible, convert to a known, significantly less hazardous substitute by January 1, 2017.
(b) If it is not possible for a business to convert to a known, significantly less hazardous substitute, as specified in subdivision (a), and the business is located within two miles of a residential dwelling, the business shall cease handling, maintaining, or storing hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid by January 1, 2017.
SEC. 3.
Section 39668.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
39668.5.
(a) An owner or operator of an oil refinery that uses hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, or modified hydrofluoric acid in its operations shall send out biannual notices to each business, school, child care facility, library, church, community facility, senior facility, and residence within a three-and-a-half-mile radius of the refinery.
(1) (A) Notice recipients located within a two-mile radius from the refinery shall be warned they may live in a lethal zone.
(B) “Lethal zone” means the area identified in a worst case scenario to expose individuals to ERPG-3 level toxins.
(C) “ERPG-3” is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.
(2) (A) Notice recipients located outside a two-mile radius but within a three-and-a-half-mile radius from the refinery shall be warned they may live in a long-term illness zone.
(B) “Long-term illness zone” means the area identified in a worst case scenario to expose individuals to ERPG-2 level toxins.
(C) “ERPG-2” is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual’s ability to take protective action.
(3) Notice recipients located within a three-and-a-half-mile radius from the refinery shall be provided the Internet Web site address of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Vulnerable Zone Indicator System.
(b) Costs for the notice shall be paid by the owner or operator of the refinery.
(c) The owner or operator shall file a copy of the notice and distribution list with the state board.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
In order to address the high risk to the public of exposure to hydrogen fluoride, including hydrofluoric acid, it is necessary this bill take effect immediately.","(1) Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt airborne toxic control measures to reduce emissions of toxic air contaminants from nonvehicular sources. Existing law prescribes civil penalties for violations of specified air pollution control laws, rules, regulations, permits, or orders of the State Air Resources Board or of an air pollution control district or air quality management district.
This bill would require an owner or operator of an oil refinery that uses hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, or modified hydrofluoric acid in its operations to send out biannual notices to each business, school, child care facility, library, church, community facility, senior facility, and residence within a 3.5-mile radius of the refinery, as specified. The bill would require the cost of the notice to be paid by the owner or operator of the refinery. The bill would require the owner or operator to file a copy of the notice and distribution list with the State Air Resources Board. An owner or operator who violates these provisions would be subject to those civil penalties.
(2) Existing law generally regulates the management of hazardous waste. A violation of the hazardous waste control laws is a crime.
This bill would require a business that, at any time, handles, maintains, or stores more than 250 gallons of hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid to, if possible, convert to a known, significantly less hazardous substitute by January 1, 2017. If that conversion is not possible and the business is located within 2 miles of a residential dwelling, the bill would require the business to cease handling, maintaining, or storing hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid by January 1, 2017. Because a violation of these requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to add Section 39668.5 to, and to add Article 11.3 (commencing with Section 25240) to Chapter 6.5 of Division 20 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to hydrogen fluoride, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

SECTION 1.
Section 222.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to read:
222.5.
(a) To select a fair and impartial jury in civil jury trials, the court shall examine the prospective jurors. Upon completion of the court’s initial examination, counsel for each party shall have the right to examine, by oral and direct questioning, any of the prospective jurors so that counsel may intelligently exercise both peremptory challenges and challenges for cause. During any examination conducted by counsel for the parties, the court should permit liberal and probing examination calculated to discover bias or prejudice with regard to the circumstances of the particular case. The fact that a topic has been included in the court’s examination should not preclude additional nonrepetitive or nonduplicative questioning in the same area by counsel.
(b) To help facilitate the jury selection process, the court in civil trials should provide to counsel for each party the complete names of the prospective jurors, both alphabetically and in the order in which they will be called.
(c) The court should allow a brief opening statement by counsel for each party before the commencement of the oral questioning phase of the voir dire process.
(d) The scope of the examination conducted by counsel shall be within reasonable limits prescribed by the court in the court’s sound discretion. In exercising its sound discretion as to the form and subject matter of voir dire questions, the court should consider, among other criteria, any unique or complex elements, legal or factual, in the case and the individual responses or conduct of jurors that may evince attitudes inconsistent with suitability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in the particular case. Specific unreasonable or arbitrary time limits shall not be imposed in any case. The court shall not establish a blanket policy of a time limit for voir dire.
(e) The court should permit counsel to conduct voir dire examination without requiring prior submission of the questions unless a particular counsel engages in improper questioning. For purposes of this section, an “improper question” is any question that, as its dominant purpose, attempts to precondition the prospective jurors to a particular result, indoctrinate the jury, or question the prospective jurors concerning the pleadings or the applicable law. A court shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably refuse to submit reasonable written questionnaires, the contents of which are determined by the court in its sound discretion, when requested by counsel. If a questionnaire is used, the parties should be given reasonable time to evaluate the responses to the questionnaires before oral questioning commences.
(f) In civil cases, the court may, upon stipulation by counsel for all the parties appearing in the action, permit counsel to examine the prospective jurors outside the court’s presence.

(b) The court shall provide to counsel for each party the complete names of the prospective jurors, both alphabetically and in the order in which they will be called. However, the court, in each criminal trial, shall determine a uniform manner by which each prospective juror shall be addressed by the court and counsel for each party, according to one of the following:
(1) An identification number assigned by the court.
(2) The prospective juror’s first name and the first initial of his or her last name.
(3) The prospective juror’s title and last name.
(c) Before examining prospective jurors, the court shall advise them that, in accordance with state law, the court and counsel for each party are prohibited, in all criminal cases, from addressing prospective jurors by their full names during jury selection, and are required to address each prospective juror by an identification number, by his or her first name and the first initial of his or her last name, or by his or her title and last name.
(d) Upon completion of the court’s initial examination, counsel for each party shall have the right to examine, by oral and direct questioning, any or all of the prospective jurors. The court may, in the exercise of its discretion, limit the oral and direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel. The court may specify the maximum amount of time that counsel for each party may question an individual juror, or may specify an aggregate amount of time for each party, which can then be allocated among the prospective jurors by counsel.
(e) Voir dire of prospective jurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases. Examination of prospective jurors shall be conducted only in aid of the exercise of challenges for cause.
(f) The court’s exercise of its discretion in the manner in which voir dire is conducted, including any limitation on the time which will be allowed for direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel and any determination that a question is not in aid of the exercise of challenges for cause, shall not cause any conviction to be reversed unless the exercise of that discretion has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, as specified in Section 13 of Article VI of the California Constitution.
(g) This section does not limit public access to juror information, as provided for under Section 237.

Voir dire of any prospective jurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases. Examination of prospective jurors shall be conducted only in aid of the exercise of challenges for cause.
(b) The trial court’s exercise of its discretion in the manner in which voir dire is conducted, including any limitation on the time which will be allowed for direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel and any determination that a question is not in aid of the exercise of challenges for cause, shall not cause any conviction to be reversed unless the exercise of that discretion has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, as specified in Section 13 of Article VI of the California Constitution.
(c) This section is operative on and after January 1, 2022.","(1) In civil trials, existing law requires a trial judge to examine prospective jurors, and, upon completion of the judge’s examination, grants counsel for each party the right to examine, by oral and direct questioning, any prospective juror in order to enable counsel to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges and challenges for cause. Existing law provides that the judge in civil trials should provide the parties with both the alphabetical list and the list of prospective jurors in the order in which they will be called.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
(2) Under existing law, which was enacted by initiative measure, in a criminal case, the court is required to conduct the examination of prospective jurors, except that the court may permit the parties, upon a showing of good cause, to conduct a further inquiry.

2/3
vote of each house.

SECTION 1.
Section 2830 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
2830.
(a) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Benefiting account” means an electricity account, or more than one account, that satisfies either of the following:
(A) The account or accounts are located within the geographical boundaries of a local government or, for a campus, within the geographical boundary of the city, county, or city and county in which the campus is located, with the account or accounts being mutually agreed upon by the local government or campus and an electrical corporation.
(B) The account or accounts belong to members of a joint powers authority and are located within the geographical boundaries of the group of public agencies that formed the joint powers authority, if the eligible renewable generating facility and electricity account or accounts are wholly located within the confines of a single county within which the joint powers authority is located and electric service is provided by a single electrical corporation, with the account or accounts being mutually agreed upon by the joint powers authority and the electrical corporation.
(2) “Bill credit” means an amount of money credited to a benefiting account that is calculated based upon the time-of-use electricity generation component of the electricity usage charge of the generating account, multiplied by the quantities of electricity generated by an eligible renewable generating facility that are exported to the grid during the corresponding time period. Electricity is exported to the grid if it is generated by an eligible renewable generating facility, is not utilized onsite by the local government, and the electricity flows through the meter site and on to the electrical corporation’s distribution or transmission infrastructure.
(3) “Campus” means an individual community college campus, individual California State University campus, or individual University of California campus.
(4) “Eligible renewable generating facility” means a generation facility that meets all of the following requirements:
(A) Has a generating capacity of no more than five megawatts.
(B) Is an eligible renewable energy resource, as defined in Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Part 1.
(C) Is located within the geographical boundary of the local government or, for a campus, within the geographical boundary of the city or city and county, if the campus is located in an incorporated area, or county, if the campus is located in an unincorporated area.
(D) Is owned by, operated by, or on property under the control of the local government or campus.
(E) Is sized to offset all or part of the electrical load of the benefiting account. For these purposes, premises that are leased by a local government or campus are under the control of the local government or campus.
(5) “Generating account” means the time-of-use electric service account of the local government or campus where the eligible renewable generating facility is located.
(6) “Local government” means a city, county, whether general law or chartered, city and county, special district, school district, political subdivision, other local public agency, or a joint powers authority formed pursuant to the Joint Exercise of Powers Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code) that has as members public agencies located within the same county and same electrical corporation service territory, but shall not mean the state, any agency or department of the state, other than an individual campus of the University of California or the California State University, or any joint powers authority that has as members public agencies located in different counties or different electrical corporation service territories, or that has as a member the federal government, any federal department or agency, this or another state, or any department or agency of this state or another state.
(b) Subject to the limitation in subdivision (h), a local government may elect to receive electric service pursuant to this section if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The local government designates one or more benefiting accounts to receive a bill credit.
(2) A benefiting account receives service under a time-of-use rate schedule.
(3) The benefiting account is the responsibility of, and serves property that is owned, operated, or on property under the control of the same local government that owns, operates, or controls the eligible renewable generating facility.
(4) The electrical output of the eligible renewable generating facility is metered for time of use to allow calculation of the bill credit based upon when the electricity is exported to the grid.
(5) All costs associated with the metering requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) are the responsibility of the local government.
(6) All costs associated with interconnection are the responsibility of the local government. For purposes of this paragraph, “interconnection” has the same meaning as defined in Section 2803, except that it applies to the interconnection of an eligible renewable generating facility rather than the energy source of a private energy producer.
(7) The local government does not sell electricity exported to the electrical grid to a third party.
(8) All electricity exported to the grid by the local government that is generated by the eligible renewable generating facility becomes the property of the electrical corporation to which the facility is interconnected, but shall not be counted toward the electrical corporation’s total retail sales for purposes of Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1. Ownership of the renewable energy credits, as defined in Section 399.12, shall be the same as the ownership of the renewable energy credits associated with electricity that is net metered pursuant to Section 2827.
(9) An electrical corporation shall not be required to compensate a local government for electricity generated from an eligible renewable facility pursuant to this section in excess of the bill credits applied to the designated benefiting account. A local government renewable generation facility participating pursuant to this section shall not be eligible for any other tariff or program that requires an electrical corporation to purchase generation from that facility while participating in the local government renewable energy self-generation program pursuant to this section.
(c) (1) A benefiting account shall be billed for all electricity usage, and for each bill component, at the rate schedule applicable to the benefiting account, including any cost-responsibility surcharge or other cost recovery mechanism, as determined by the commission, to reimburse the Department of Water Resources for purchases of electricity, pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code.
(2) The bill shall then subtract the bill credit applicable to the benefiting account. The generation component credited to the benefiting account shall not include the cost-responsibility surcharge or other cost recovery mechanism, as determined by the commission, to reimburse the Department of Water Resources for purchases of electricity, pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code. The electrical corporation shall ensure that the local government receives the full bill credit.
(3) If, during the billing cycle, the generation component of the electricity usage charges exceeds the bill credit, the benefiting account shall be billed for the difference.
(4) If, during the billing cycle, the bill credit applied pursuant to paragraph (2) exceeds the generation component of the electricity usage charges, the difference shall be carried forward as a financial credit to the next billing cycle.
(5) After the electricity usage charge pursuant to paragraph (1) and the credit pursuant to paragraph (2) are determined for the last billing cycle of a 12-month period, any remaining credit resulting from the application of this section shall be reset to zero.
(d) The commission shall ensure that the transfer of a bill credit to a benefiting account does not result in a shifting of costs to bundled service subscribers. The costs associated with the transfer of a bill credit shall include all billing-related expenses.
(e) Not more frequently than once per year, and upon providing the electrical corporation with a minimum of 60 days’ notice, the local government may elect to change a benefiting account. Any credit resulting from the application of this section earned prior to the change in a benefiting account that has not been used as of the date of the change in the benefiting account shall be applied, and may only be applied, to a benefiting account as changed.
(f) A local government shall provide the electrical corporation to which the eligible renewable generating facility will be interconnected with not less than 60 days’ notice prior to the eligible renewable generating facility becoming operational. The electrical corporation shall file an advice letter with the commission that complies with this section not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice proposing a rate tariff for a benefiting account. The commission, within 30 days of the date of filing, shall approve the proposed tariff or specify conforming changes to be made by the electrical corporation to be filed in a new advice letter.
(g) The local government may terminate its election pursuant to subdivision (b), upon providing the electrical corporation with a minimum of 60 days’ notice. Should the local government sell its interest in the eligible renewable generating facility, or sell the electricity generated by the eligible renewable generating facility, in a manner other than required by this section, upon the date of either event, and the earliest date if both events occur, no further bill credit pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) may be earned. Only credit earned prior to that date shall be made to a benefiting account.
(h) An electrical corporation is not obligated to provide a bill credit to a benefiting account that is not designated by a local government prior to the point in time that the combined statewide cumulative rated generating capacity of all eligible renewable generating facilities within the service territories of the state’s three largest electrical corporations reaches 250 megawatts. Only those eligible renewable generating facilities that are providing bill credits to benefiting accounts pursuant to this section shall count toward reaching this 250-megawatt limitation. Each electrical corporation shall only be required to offer service or contracts under this section until that electrical corporation reaches its proportionate share of the 250-megawatt limitation based on the ratio of its peak demand to the total statewide peak demand of all electrical corporations.
(i) This chapter does not apply to an electrical corporation with 60,000 or fewer customer accounts.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission is vested with regulatory authority over public utilities. Existing law authorizes a local governmental entity, except a joint powers authority, to receive a bill credit to a designated benefiting account, for electricity exported to the electrical grid by an eligible renewable generating facility and requires the commission to adopt a rate tariff for the benefiting account.
This bill would include as a local governmental entity for this purpose a joint powers authority, except as specified.
Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or an order or direction of the commission is a crime. Because the provisions of this bill would require an order or other action of the commission to implement and a violation of that order or action would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 2830 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to renewable energy."

This bill would require, instead, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a partnership and a limited liability company classified as a partnership to file a return on the 15th day of the 3rd month, and a taxpayer subject to the Corporation Tax Law, but not an “S corporation,” to file a return on the 15th day of the 4th month, following the close of its taxable year.

SECTION 1.
Section 67386 of the Education Code is amended to read:
67386.
(a) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, as defined in the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1092(f)), involving a student, both on and off campus. The policy shall include all of the following:
(1) An affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity. “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.
(2) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:
(A) The accused’s belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the accused.
(B) The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented.
(3) A policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is the preponderance of the evidence.
(4) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances:
(A) The complainant was asleep or unconscious.
(B) The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.
(C) The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.
(b) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards. At a minimum, the policies and protocols shall cover all of the following:
(1) A policy statement on how the institution will provide appropriate protections for the privacy of individuals involved, including confidentiality.
(2) Initial response by the institution’s personnel to a report of an incident, including requirements specific to assisting the victim, providing information in writing about the importance of preserving evidence, and the identification and location of witnesses.
(3) Response to stranger and nonstranger sexual assault.
(4) The preliminary victim interview, including the development of a victim interview protocol, and a comprehensive followup victim interview, as appropriate.
(5) Contacting and interviewing the accused.
(6) Seeking the identification and location of witnesses.
(7) Providing written notification to the victim about the availability of, and contact information for, on- and off-campus resources and services, and coordination with law enforcement, as appropriate.
(8) Participation of victim advocates and other supporting people.
(9) Investigating allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident.
(10) Providing that an individual who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of the institution’s student conduct policy at or near the time of the incident, unless the institution determines that the violation was egregious, including, but not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.
(11) The role of the institutional staff supervision.
(12) A comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.
(13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties.
(c) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall, to the extent feasible, enter into memoranda of understanding, agreements, or collaborative partnerships with existing on-campus and community-based organizations, including rape crisis centers, to refer students for assistance or make services available to students, including counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance, and including resources for the accused.
(d) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. A comprehensive prevention program shall include a range of prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, empowerment programming for victim prevention, awareness raising campaigns, primary prevention, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Outreach programs shall be provided to make students aware of the institution’s policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. At a minimum, an outreach program shall include a process for contacting and informing the student body, campus organizations, athletic programs, and student groups about the institution’s overall sexual assault policy, the practical implications of an affirmative consent standard, and the rights and responsibilities of students under the policy.
(e) (1) Commencing January 1, 2018, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall conduct annual training of their respective employees, in addition to the training required by paragraph (12) of subdivision (b), on the employee’s obligations in responding to and reporting incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students.
(2) An employee trained pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed to have satisfied the annual training requirement for each campus or community college district, as applicable, within each segment that the employee is employed at for that year.
(f) Outreach programming shall be included as part of every incoming student’s orientation.","Existing law requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards, covering specified topics, including a comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2018, require those institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to conduct annual training of their respective employees, in addition to the training described above, on the employee’s obligations in responding to and reporting incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students. The bill would provide that an employee trained pursuant to these provisions is deemed to have satisfied the annual training requirement for each campus or community college district, as applicable, within each segment that the employee is employed at for that year.","An act to amend Section 67386 of the Education Code, relating to student safety."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Following significant damage to school buildings in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the Field Act was enacted to mandate the earthquake-resistant construction of schools.
(b) The Division of the State Architect (DSA) reviews the design, construction, alteration, addition, and rehabilitation of K–12 public schools and community colleges.
(c) The DSA also monitors the safety of nonstructural components installed in school facilities.
(d) Implementation of the Field Act, as defined pursuant to Section 17281 of the Education Code, depends upon a complex interrelationship with dispersed responsibilities among state departments and agencies, school districts, local government building departments, educational institutions, and the construction industry.
(e) The South Napa earthquake struck in the early morning on August 24, 2014. Structural damage to schools was minimal. However, nonstructural damage was significant and could have been life threatening had the earthquake occurred during school hours.
(f) The earthquake highlighted dangers posed by light fixtures, unrestrained bookcases, storage units, furniture, and other similar school contents that are not subject to the Field Act’s requirements.
(g) The DSA has issued guidelines for nonstructural earthquake hazards in California schools, which include furniture and equipment. However, there are no requirements in state law similar to the requirements of the Field Act that require the DSA, local fire agencies, or school districts to inspect schools to ensure that school contents comply with the DSA nonstructural component guidelines.
(h) School classrooms should be examined to ensure that furnishings and equipment are properly located, anchored, and braced to prevent harm to pupils and school personnel, and to ensure egress from any room after an earthquake.

CHAPTER  8. Nonstructural Earthquake Hazards
17660.
(a) (1) On or before January 1, 2020, each school district, county office of education, and charter school shall complete an inspection of the contents, as described in Section 17661, in areas that are accessible to or occupied by pupils, including classrooms, hallways, libraries, gymnasiums, multipurpose rooms, cafeterias, computer rooms, administrative offices, and other similar spaces in each of its school buildings located in an area of higher seismicity to assess whether the contents in each area comply with the guidelines set forth in Chapter 3 (Furniture and Equipment) of the “Guide and Checklist for Nonstructural Earthquake Hazards in California Schools,” published by the Office of Emergency Services in cooperation with the State Department of Education, the Department of General Services, and the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission pursuant to Section 8587.7 of the Government Code, and to develop corrective actions to bring noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines.
(2) For purposes of this section, “higher seismicity” means an area with the result of .30g or greater on the California Geological Survey’s Ground Motion Interpolator found on the Department of Conservation Internet Web site.
(3) The Department of Conservation, on or before February 1, 2017, shall post instructions or a hyperlink on its Internet Web site on how to determine whether a school district, county office of education, or charter school building is located in an area of higher seismicity.
(b) (1) Within 60 days of completing the inspection for each area within a school building described in subdivision (a), a checklist of compliant and noncompliant contents shall be reported to the governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable. The report shall include a prioritization of noncompliant items that present an immediate and serious threat to the safety of pupils and school personnel and a set of recommended corrective actions to bring high-priority noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines.
(2) The governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, shall review the report in a public meeting held pursuant to the Ralph M. Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code), or, in the case of a statewide charter school, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), and shall post the report on its Internet Web site.
(c) (1) The superintendent of a school district, the county superintendent of schools, or the chief administrator of a charter school, as applicable, shall annually certify in writing to the governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, which corrective actions recommended in the report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) have been taken and completed.
(2) The certifications for each school building shall be posted to the school district’s, county office of education’s, or charter school’s Internet Web site, as applicable.
(d) If a school district, county office of education, or charter school completes an inspection pursuant to subdivision (a) before January 1, 2017, the school district, county office of education, or charter school may report the inspection and any corresponding corrective actions it takes to the governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, to comply with paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).
17661.
For purposes of this chapter, “contents” includes, but is not limited to, file cabinets, bookcases, desktop and countertop equipment, equipment on carts, display cases, art objects, potted plants, aquariums, equipment on wheels or rollers, such as pianos and chalkboards, office equipment, refrigerators, vending machines, shop and gym equipment, gas cylinders, gas piping, and storage racks.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the Field Act, generally requires the Department of General Services to supervise the design and construction of, the reconstruction or alteration of, or the addition to, a school building to ensure, among other things, that plans and specifications comply with adopted rules and regulations and building standards, including those relating to seismic safety. Existing law requires the Office of Emergency Services, in cooperation with the State Department of Education, the Department of General Services, and the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission, to develop an educational pamphlet for use by school personnel to identify and mitigate the risks posed by nonstructural earthquake hazards.
This bill would require each school district, county office of education, and charter school, on or before January 1, 2020, to complete an inspection of the contents in areas that are accessible to or occupied by pupils in each of its school buildings located in an area of higher seismicity, as defined, to assess whether the contents in each area comply with the guidelines set forth in the pamphlet and to develop corrective actions to bring noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines. The bill would require, within 60 days of completing the inspection for each area within a school building, that a checklist of compliant and noncompliant contents be reported to the governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, with a prioritization of noncompliant items that threaten the safety of pupils and school personnel and a set of recommended corrective actions to bring high-priority noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines. By imposing additional duties on local educational agency officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the Department of Conservation, on or before February 1, 2017, to post instructions or a hyperlink on its Internet Web site on how to determine whether a school district, county office of education, or charter school building is located in an area of higher seismicity. The bill would make implementation of these provisions contingent upon funding being provided in the annual Budget Act or another statute.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 17660) to Part 10.5 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, relating to school facilities."

The association shall not edit or redact any content from these communications, but may include a statement specifying that the candidate or member, and not the association, is responsible for that content.
(2) Ensure access to the common area meeting space, if any exists, during a campaign, at no cost, to all candidates, including those who are not incumbents, and to all members advocating a point of view, including those not endorsed by the board, for purposes reasonably related to the election.

be a candidate for director.
(9) Ensure a member who satisfies the lawful qualifications adopted pursuant to paragraph (4) and by the association’s governing documents shall not be denied the right to vote.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, the rules adopted pursuant to this section may provide for the nomination of candidates from the floor of membership meetings or nomination by any other manner. Those rules may permit write-in candidates for ballots.

Section 5145 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
5145.
(a) A member of an association may bring a civil action for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this article by the association, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, restitution, or a combination thereof, within one year of the date the cause of action accrues. Upon a finding that the election procedures of this article, or the adoption of and adherence to rules provided by Article 5 (commencing with Section 4340) of Chapter 3, were not followed, a court may void any results of the election.
(b) A member who prevails in a civil action to enforce the member’s rights pursuant to this article shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, and the court may impose a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500) for each violation, except that each identical violation shall be subject to only one penalty if the violation affects each member of the association equally. A prevailing association shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.
(c) A cause of action under Sections 5100 to 5130, inclusive, with respect to access to association resources by a candidate or member advocating a point of view, the receipt of a ballot by a member, the counting, tabulation, or reporting of, or access to, ballots for inspection and review after tabulation, or a violation of a rule required by Section 5105 may be brought in small claims court if the amount of the demand does not exceed the jurisdiction of that court.","The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act defines and regulates common interest developments that are not a commercial or industrial common interest development. The act requires a common interest development to be managed by an association, requires the association to select one or 3 independent 3rd parties as an inspector or inspectors of elections, and generally requires the association’s elections regarding assessments legally requiring a vote, the election and removal of directors, amendments to the governing documents, or the grant of exclusive use of common area, to be conducted by the inspector or inspectors of elections in accordance with specified rules and procedures. The act excepts from these election requirements an election of directors if the governing documents of the association provide that one member from each separate interest is a director.
This bill would additionally except from those election requirements an election of directors if the election is uncontested, as defined, and would provide a procedure for an election to be declared as uncontested. The bill adds 2 additional election requirements that would ensure an announcement of an election and notification of nomination procedures is provided in a specific manner and would ensure a member
in good standing
who meets specified qualification requirements
is not denied the right to vote or the right to be a candidate for director. The bill would authorize a cause of action alleging a violation of these and other specified election requirements to be brought in small claims court if the amount of the demand does not exceed the jurisdiction of that court.","An act to amend Sections 5100, 5105, and 5145 of the Civil Code, relating to common interest developments."

Fees charged and collected under the Real Estate Law, except as otherwise provided, are deposited into the Real Estate Fund and continuously appropriated for use by the commissioner, as specified. Existing law requires the commissioner to provide on the Internet specific information regarding the status of every license issued by the department.
This bill would authorize the commissioner, upon petition by a licensee accompanied by a specified fee, to remove from the posting of discipline an item that has been posted on the bureau’s Internet Web site for at least 10 years and for which the licensee provides evidence of rehabilitation indicating that the notice is no longer required to prevent a credible risk to members of the public utilizing licensed activity of the licensee. The bill would require the commissioner, in evaluating a petition, to take into consideration other violations that present a credible risk to the members of the public since the posting of discipline requested for removal, as specified. Because the fees collected pursuant to these provisions would be deposited in the Real Estate Fund, which is continuously appropriated, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would also authorize the bureau to develop, through regulations, the amount of the fee and the minimum information to be included in a licensee’s petition, including, but not limited to, a written justification and evidence of rehabilitation. The bill would require the petition process to commence January 1, 2018.

SECTION 1.
Section 14557 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:
14557.
“Provisional registration” means that under certain circumstances, a label for renewal on an auxiliary soil and plant substance, packaged agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or specialty fertilizer, alone or in any combination, may be registered for a limited period of time while labels are being corrected and reprinted or during registration renewal.
SEC. 2.
Section 14601 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:
14601.
(a) Each differing label, other than weight or package size, such as changes in the guaranteed analysis, derivation statement, or anything that implies a different product, for specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, auxiliary soil and plant substance, organic input material, and packaged soil amendment shall be registered. The department may develop a schedule for all registrations to be submitted to the department for approval, and registrations shall be valid for two years. The registration fee shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200) per product, except for organic input material.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the registration fee for organic input material shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per product, as the registration of organic input material labels require additional departmental resources and review time to ensure that nutrient guarantees and claims are scientifically feasible and meet National Organic Program standards. Funds generated from the registration of organic input material shall be deposited into the Organic Input Materials Account in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund and, notwithstanding Section 221, shall be available upon appropriation by the Legislature.
(c) The secretary may, based on the findings and recommendations of the board, reduce the registration fees to a lower rate that provides sufficient revenue to carry out this chapter.
(d) Registrations may not be issued without a current license.
(e) The secretary may require proof of labeling statements and other claims made for any specialty fertilizer, agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or auxiliary soil and plant substance, before the secretary registers any such product. As evidence of proof, the secretary may rely on experimental data, evaluations, or advice furnished by scientists, including scientists affiliated with the University of California, and may accept or reject additional sources of proof in the evaluation of any fertilizing material. In all cases, experimental proof shall relate to conditions in California under which the product is intended for use.
(f) The secretary may perform site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes used to validate label nutrient guarantees, claims, and compliance with National Organic Program standards giving priority to inspecting high-risk products and manufacturers. The department may accept inspections performed by a third-party organization approved by the secretary for organic input material manufacturers. All inspection records obtained by a contracted third-party organization shall be made available to the secretary upon request. When a contracted third-party organization is conducting a site inspection, the organization shall notify the department of when the inspection is going to take place no less than 72 hours in advance of the inspection. Department representatives may be present at the inspection.
(g) (1) The secretary, after hearing, may cancel the registration of, or refuse to register, any specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or auxiliary soil and plant substance, which the secretary determines is detrimental or injurious to plants, animals, public safety, or the environment when it is applied as directed, which is known to be of little or no value for the purpose for which it is intended, or for which any false or misleading claim is made or implied. The secretary may cancel the registration of any product of any person who violates this chapter.
(2) The proceedings to determine whether to cancel or refuse registration of any of those products shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The secretary shall have all the powers that are granted pursuant to Chapter 5.
SEC. 3.
Section 14603 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:

SEC. 4.
Section 14604 is added to the Food and Agricultural Code, to read:
14604.
The secretary may grant a provisional registration for a period not exceeding six months for a registered product undergoing renewal. All fees shall be paid before the issuance of any provisional registration.
SEC. 5.
Section 14681 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:
14681.
No person shall distribute misbranded fertilizing materials. A fertilizing material shall be deemed to be misbranded under any of the following conditions:
(a) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way.
(b) If it is distributed under the name of another fertilizing material, as determined by the department.
(c) If it is not labeled as required by regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.
(d) If it purports to be, or is represented as, a fertilizing material, or is represented as containing a primary or secondary plant nutrient or micronutrients, or both, unless the plant nutrients conform to the definition of identity, if any, prescribed by regulation. In adopting these regulations, due regard shall be given to commonly accepted definitions and official fertilizer terms such as those prescribed by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials.","Existing law generally regulates fertilizing materials, as defined and which includes organic input material, and provides for the licensure of individuals who manufacture or distribute fertilizing materials. Existing law requires organic input material manufacturers to be inspected at least once per year. Existing law, for purposes of those provisions, defines “provisional registration” to mean that under certain circumstances, a label for renewal on an auxiliary soil and plant substance, packaged agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or specialty fertilizer, alone or in any combination, may be registered for a limited period of time while labels are being corrected and reprinted.
This bill would provide that such a label for renewal may be registered for a limited period of time while labels are being corrected and reprinted or during registration renewal.
Existing law requires that each differing label, other than weight or package size, as described, for specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, auxiliary soil and plant substance, organic input material, and packaged soil amendment be registered, and requires that all registrations be renewed in January of an even-numbered year, and be valid until December 31 of the following odd-numbered year, if issued in January of that same year.
This bill would delete those provisions regarding the date for renewal of those registrations and would instead authorize the Department of Food and Agriculture to develop a schedule for all registration to be submitted to the department for approval and would require that registrations be valid for 2 years.
Existing law authorizes the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to perform site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes used to validate label nutrient guarantees, claims, and compliance with specified federal standards during the registration process, and to accept inspections performed by a 3rd-party organization recognized by the National Organic Program for out-of-state organic input material manufacturers. Existing law requires all inspection records obtained by the 3rd-party organization to be made available to the secretary upon request.
This bill would eliminate the requirement that organic input material manufacturers be inspected at least once per year, and would delete the limitation that the secretary is authorized to perform site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes only during the registration process. The bill would provide that those site inspections give priority to inspecting high-risk products and manufacturers. The bill would authorize the Department of Food and Agriculture to accept inspections performed by a 3rd-party organization approved by the secretary for organic input material manufacturers. The bill would require all inspection records obtained by a contracted 3rd-party organization to be made available to the secretary upon request.
This bill would authorize the secretary to grant a provisional registration for a period not exceeding 6 months for a registered product undergoing renewal. The bill would make various changes to the dates during which registration and renewals are valid.
Existing law prohibits a person from distributing a misbranded fertilizing material under specified conditions, including, among other things, if the misbranded fertilizing material is deemed to be distributed under the name of another fertilizing material.
This bill would revise that condition to prohibit distribution of a misbranded fertilizing material deemed to be distributed under the name of another fertilizing material, as determined by the department.","An act to amend Sections 14557, 14601, 14603, and 14681 of, and to add Section 14604 to, the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to fertilizer."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83, the Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act (Jessica’s Law), approved by the voters at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, makes a defendant subject to imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life if convicted of certain crimes, including rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, or rape, spousal rape, or sexual penetration in concert, if certain circumstances were present, including, among other things, in the commission of that offense, any person kidnapped the victim, tortured the victim, or committed the offense during the commission of a burglary, as specified. Existing law also makes a defendant subject to imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years to life if convicted of certain crimes, including rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, or rape, spousal rape, or sexual penetration in concert, if certain circumstances were present, including, among other things, in the commission of that offense any person, except as specified in the provisions above, kidnapped the victim, committed the offense during the commission of a burglary, or used a dangerous or deadly weapon in the commission of the offense. Proposition 83 provides that the Legislature may amend the provisions of the act to expand the scope of their application or increase the punishment or penalties by a statute passed by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature.
This bill would add the crimes of rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation, perpetrated against a person who is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, to the above provisions, if the victim is developmentally disabled, as defined. By applying the above enhancements to these crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes a defendant subject to imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life if convicted of certain crimes, including rape, spousal rape or sexual penetration in concert, sexual penetration, sodomy, or oral copulation if certain circumstances were present, including, among other things, in the commission of that offense, any person kidnapped the victim, committed the offense during the commission of a burglary, or used a dangerous or deadly weapon in the commission of the offense, or under other specified circumstances, and the crime was committed against a minor 14 years of age or older.
This bill would add the crimes of rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation, perpetrated against a person who is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, to the above provisions, if the victim is developmentally disabled, as defined. By applying the above enhancements to these crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) Existing law requires that a person who commits certain enumerated crimes, including rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and sexual penetration, against a person who is 65 years of age or older, or against a person who is blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, a paraplegic, or a quadriplegic, or against a person who is under 14 years of age, receive a one-year sentence enhancement and requires that any person having a prior conviction for any of the enumerated offenses receive a 2-year sentence enhancement.
This bill would add to the enumerated list of crimes rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and sexual penetration, perpetrated against a person who is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent. By applying the above enhancements to these crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 667.61 and 667.9 of the Penal Code, relating to sex offenses."
933,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to the 2016 report of the Public Policy Institute of California entitled California’s Future: Health Care, significant health disparities exist among socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and regional groups in California. African Americans and persons with a high school education or less have significantly lower life expectancies than other groups of people, and individuals in some regions of the state or in particular communities face other significant health obstacles.
(b) The ability to translate medical findings from research to practice relies largely on having robust patient participation and a diverse participation pool. A low participation rate or a homogenous participant group prevents segments of the population from benefiting from advances achieved through clinical research and creates uncertainties over the applicability of research findings. Diverse patient participation in a clinical trial depends, in part, on whether a participant can afford ancillary costs like transportation, child care, or lodging during the course of his or her participation. A national study in 2015 found that patient households making less than $50,000 annually were almost 30 percent less likely to participate in clinical trials. This disparity threatens one of the most basic ethical underpinnings of clinical research, the requirement that the benefits of research be made available equitably among all eligible individuals.
(c) California is home to the following 10 National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that perform cancer clinical trials research:
(1) University of California, Irvine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(2) City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(3) University of California, Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(4) Salk Institute Cancer Center.
(5) Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute.
(6) Stanford Cancer Institute.
(7) University of California, Davis, Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(8) University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center.
(9) University of California, San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(10) University of Southern California, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.
(d) Cancer is the cause of almost one in four deaths in California. It is the second leading cause of death for Californians and the primary cause of death among Californian Asian/Pacific Islanders. A Californian will be diagnosed with cancer approximately every four minutes, and every 10 minutes a Californian will die of cancer. African American Californians in particular face disproportionally higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to other races and ethnicities.
(e) Addressing barriers faced by medically underserved and underrepresented individuals in cancer and other clinical trials and improving access to survivorship resources and services through partnerships with hospitals, regional and community cancer centers, and nonprofit organizations are some of the strategies recommended by the California Dialogue on Cancer, established in 2002 by California’s Comprehensive Cancer Control Program to reduce the burden of cancer in California.
(f) According to the National Cancer Institute Cancer Clinical Trials Resource Guide, some of the barriers preventing individuals with cancer or at high risk of developing cancer from participating in clinical trials are direct and indirect financial and personal costs, including travel and child care expenses.
(g) It is the finding of the Legislature that some corporations, individuals, public and private foundations, health care providers, and other stakeholders are hesitant to contribute to, or accept funds from, programs that are organized to alleviate financial burdens faced by patients who wish to participate in clinical trials and their caregivers, due to concerns that federal regulators would view the payments made from those funds as prohibited inducements for patients to receive the health care services provided during clinical trials.
(h) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a program to authorize business, industry, public and private foundations, individuals, and other stakeholders to donate to the program described in this act, as well as to other nonprofit corporations and public charities that specialize in the enrollment, retention, and increased participation of patients in cancer clinical trials.
(i) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a program to better enable donors willing to assist clinical research participants that have documented low levels of access to health services or participation in clinical trials, face financial barriers to participation in clinical trials, or have been identified as priorities for health services, to participate in clinical trials by supporting ancillary costs to boost participation rates among the research participant populations, ensure these trials are widely accessible, improve the development of therapies, and enhance innovation. It is the intent of the Legislature that this program eliminate barriers to the participation of all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, in clinical trials.

SECTION 1.
Section 655.1 of the Harbors and Navigation Code is amended to read:
655.1.
(a) As used in this section, “mechanically propelled vessel” means any vessel actively propelled by machinery, whether or not the machinery is the principal source of propulsion.
(b) (1) A peace officer, having reasonable cause to believe that any person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, who lawfully arrests the person for any violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655, may request that person to submit to chemical testing of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood.
(2) The arrested person shall be advised of all of the following:
(A) A criminal complaint may be filed against him or her for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug.
(B) He or she has a right to refuse chemical testing.
(C) An officer has the authority to seek a search warrant compelling the arrested person to submit a blood sample as described in paragraph (16) of subdivision (a) of Section 1524 of the Penal Code.
(D) He or she does not have the right to have an attorney present before stating whether he or she will submit to the chemical testing, before deciding which chemical test or tests to take, or during the administration of the chemical test or tests chosen.
(c) If the person is lawfully arrested for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and submits to the chemical testing, the person has the choice of whether the chemical test shall be of his or her blood or breath and the person shall be advised by the arresting officer that he or she has that choice. If the person arrested either is incapable, or states that he or she is incapable, of completing the chosen test, the person shall submit to the remaining test. If a blood or breath test, or both, are unavailable, then subdivision (n) applies.
(d) If the person is lawfully arrested for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of any drug or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug and submits to the chemical testing, the person has the choice of whether the chemical test shall be of his or her blood, breath, or urine, and the officer shall advise the person that he or she has that choice.
(e) A person who chooses to submit to a breath test may also be requested to submit to a blood or urine test if the arresting officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device under the influence of any drug, or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, and if the arresting officer has a clear indication that a blood or urine test will reveal evidence of the person being under the influence. The arresting officer shall state in his or her report the facts upon which that belief and that clear indication are based. The person shall have the choice of submitting to and completing a blood or urine test, and shall be advised by the arresting officer that he or she is requested to submit to an additional test, and that he or she may choose a test of either blood or urine. If the person arrested is either incapable, or states that he or she is incapable, of completing either chosen chemical test, the person shall submit to and complete the other remaining chemical test.
(f) (1) A person who chooses to submit to a breath test shall be advised before or after the breath test that the breath-testing equipment does not retain any sample of the breath, and that no breath sample will be available after the breath test which could be analyzed later by the person or any other person.
(2) The person shall also be advised that, because no breath sample is retained, the person will be given an opportunity to provide a blood or urine sample that will be retained at no cost to the person so that there will be something retained that may be subsequently analyzed for the alcoholic content of the persons’s blood. If the person completes a breath test and wishes to provide a blood or urine sample to be retained, the sample shall be collected and retained in the same manner as if the person had chosen a blood or urine test initially.
(3) The person shall also be advised that the blood or urine sample may be tested by either party in any criminal prosecution. The failure of either party to perform this chemical test shall place no duty upon the opposing party to perform the chemical test nor affect the admissibility of any other evidence of the drug or alcoholic content of the blood of the person arrested.
(g) If the person is lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655, and because of the need for medical treatment, the person is first transported to a medical facility where it is not feasible to administer a particular chemical test of, or to obtain a particular sample of, the person’s blood, breath, or urine, the person has the choice of submitting to those chemical tests which are available at the facility to which that person has been transported. In this event, the arresting officer shall advise the person of those chemical tests which are available at the medical facility, and that the person’s choice is limited to those chemical tests which are available.
(h) Any person who is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him or her incapable of refusal may be subjected to chemical testing of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood, whether or not the person is advised of the information specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).
(i) Any person who is afflicted with hemophilia is exempt from the blood test provided for in this section.
(j) Any person who is afflicted with a heart condition and is using an anticoagulant under the direction of a licensed physician and surgeon is exempt from the blood test provided for in this section.
(k) A person lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed while the person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655 may request the arresting officer to have a chemical test made of his or her blood or breath for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood and, if so requested, the arresting officer shall have the chemical test performed. However, if a blood or breath test, or both, are unavailable, then subdivision (n) applies.
(l) Any chemical test of blood, breath, or urine to determine the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in the blood shall be performed in accordance with Section 23158 of the Vehicle Code.
(m) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a peace officer to gather evidence from a person lawfully arrested for a violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655.
(n) If a blood or breath test is not available under paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) or under subdivision (k), the person shall submit to the remaining test in order to determine the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in the person’s blood. If both the blood and breath tests are unavailable, the person shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her urine and shall submit to a urine test.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law makes it unlawful for any person to operate a vessel or water-related device while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or both. Existing law directs the administration of a chemical test that is used to analyze an individual’s breath, blood, or urine for evidence of drug or alcohol use when the individual is arrested for these actions. Existing law requires the arrested individual to be informed that a refusal to submit to, or failure to complete, the required chemical testing may be used against the person in court and that the court, upon convicting the arrested individual, may impose increased penalties for his or her refusal or failure.
This bill would instead require the arrested individual to be advised that a criminal complaint may be filed against him or her for operating a vessel or water-related device while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or both; that he or she has a right to refuse chemical testing; and that the officer has the authority to seek a search warrant compelling him or her to submit a blood sample. By imposing new duties on local peace officers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 655.1 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, relating to vessels."

(c) The commission shall review and accept, modify, or reject each electrical corporation’s renewable energy resource procurement plan prior to the commencement of renewable energy procurement pursuant to this article by an electrical corporation. The commission shall assess adherence to the approved renewable energy resource procurement plans in determining compliance with the obligations of this article.
(d) Unless previously preapproved by the commission, an electrical corporation shall submit a contract for the generation of an eligible renewable energy resource to the commission for review and approval consistent with an approved renewable energy resource procurement plan. If the commission determines that the bid prices are elevated due to a lack of effective competition among the bidders, the commission shall direct the electrical corporation to renegotiate the contracts or conduct a new solicitation.
(e) If an electrical corporation fails to comply with a commission order adopting a renewable energy resource procurement plan, the commission shall exercise its authority to require compliance.
(f) (1) The commission may authorize a procurement entity to enter into contracts on behalf of customers of a retail seller for electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to satisfy the retail seller’s renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. The commission shall not require any person or corporation to act as a procurement entity or require any party to purchase eligible renewable energy resources from a procurement entity.
(2) Subject to review and approval by the commission, the procurement entity shall be permitted to recover reasonable administrative and procurement costs through the retail rates of end-use customers that are served by the procurement entity and are directly benefiting from the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources.
(g) Procurement and administrative costs associated with contracts entered into by an electrical corporation for eligible renewable energy resources pursuant to this article and approved by the commission are reasonable and prudent and shall be recoverable in rates.
(h) Construction, alteration, demolition, installation, and repair work on an eligible renewable energy resource that receives production incentives pursuant to Section 25742 of the Public Resources Code, including work performed to qualify, receive, or maintain production incentives, are “public works” for the purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code.","Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Public Utilities Act requires the commission to review and accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical corporation based on whether it includes specified elements or incentive mechanisms, and whether it accomplishes certain objectives. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program, within the act, requires retail sellers, defined as including electrical corporations, and local publicly owned electric utilities to purchase specified minimum quantities of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, for specified compliance periods. The program requires the commission to direct each electrical corporation to annually prepare a renewable energy procurement plan to satisfy its procurement requirements pursuant to the program. To the extent feasible, the renewable energy procurement plan is to be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive revision to the provision that requires, to the extent feasible, that the renewable energy procurement plan be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process.","An act to amend Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."

It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to create the Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability as the statewide postsecondary education coordination and planning entity.","(1) Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, independent institutions of higher education, and private postsecondary educational institutions as the segments of postsecondary education in this state.
Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that budget and policy decisions regarding postsecondary education generally adhere to 3 specified goals and that appropriate metrics be identified, defined, and formally adopted to monitor progress toward the achievement of the goals.
Existing law establishes the California Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC) as the statewide postsecondary education coordinating and planning agency, and provides for its functions and responsibilities. Existing law also provides for the composition of CPEC’s membership. The annual state Budget Acts from the 2011–12 fiscal year to the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, have provided no funding for CPEC.
This bill would establish the Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability as the statewide postsecondary education coordination and planning entity. The bill would provide for the appointment by the Governor, subject to confirmation by a majority of the membership of the Senate, of an executive director of the office. The bill would establish an 8-member advisory board for the purpose of examining, and making recommendations to, the office regarding the functions and operations of the office and reviewing and commenting on any recommendations made by the office to the Governor and the Legislature, among other specified duties.
The bill would specify the functions and responsibilities of the office, which would include, among other things, participation, as specified, in the identification and periodic revision of state goals and priorities for higher education, reviewing and making recommendations regarding cross-segmental and interagency initiatives and programs, advising the Legislature and the Governor regarding the need for, and the location of, new institutions and campuses of public higher education, acting as a clearinghouse for postsecondary education information and as a primary source of information for the Legislature, the Governor, and other agencies, and reviewing all proposals for changes in eligibility pools for admission to public institutions and segments of postsecondary education.
The bill would authorize the office to require the governing boards and institutions of public postsecondary education to submit data to the office on plans and programs, costs, selection and retention of students, enrollments, plant capacities, and other matters pertinent to effective planning, policy development, and articulation and coordination. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the office to report to the Legislature and the Governor on or before December 31 of each year regarding its progress in achieving specified objectives and responsibilities.
The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
(2)  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as the 3 public segments of postsecondary education in this state.

SEC. 2.
Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 1997. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 1997, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 3.
To the extent that this act has an overall effect of increasing the costs already borne by a local agency for programs or levels of service mandated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation within the meaning of Section 36 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, it shall apply to local agencies only to the extent that the state provides annual funding for the cost increase. Any new program or higher level of service provided by a local agency pursuant to this act above the level for which funding has been provided shall not require a subvention of funds by the state nor otherwise be subject to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) Existing law establishes the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-FC) program, under which counties provide payments to foster care providers on behalf of qualified children in foster care. Existing law establishes a schedule of basic rates to be paid for the care and supervision of each foster child. Existing law also establishes the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment Program (Kin-GAP), which provides aid on behalf of eligible children who are placed in the home of a relative caretaker.
Existing law requires, when a child is living with a parent who receives AFDC-FC or Kin-GAP benefits, that the rate paid to the foster care provider on behalf of the parent include an additional amount, known as an infant supplement, for the care and supervision of the child.
This bill would make a pregnant minor or nonminor dependent eligible for the infant supplement for a specified period before the expected date of birth, subject to a verification of pregnancy, as specified. Because counties would administer these extended benefits, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) This bill would incorporate changes to Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1997, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to foster children."
938,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all the following:
(a) The current pervasive use of information technology in public enterprises has resulted in an abundance of public access to information and services provided by the government, but the increased interdependence of information technology systems has created a new type of risk for society. Threats to public critical infrastructure that use information technology within the state present risks to public health and safety and could severely disrupt economic activity within California.
(b) Ensuring sufficient preparations are taken to protect critical infrastructure from interference, compromise, or incapacitation are in the public interest and serve a public purpose.
(c) A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, related to state agency critical infrastructure information and control, developed in a coordinated effort among state agencies, will help prepare for threats to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing the potential consequences from those attacks.
(d) The Department of Technology, in its role as the lead entity that coordinates state resources in the development of information technology (IT) strategy and policy, directs state agency information security and privacy standards and procedures for the day-to-day protection of state information assets from a variety of threats, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity threats and attacks.
(e) The Office of Emergency Services, in its role as the lead executive entity that coordinates state resources for emergency preparedness, response, and damage mitigation, is integrating cybersecurity into the State Emergency Plan.
(f) The Department of Technology is continuing its state government oversight and compliance monitoring program, and enhancing day-to-day information security incident response coordination with the Office of Emergency Services, Department of the California Highway Patrol’s Computer Crimes Investigation Unit, and the Military Department.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this legislation to add to the ongoing work of the state’s comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, undertaken in a coordinated effort among state agencies, to prepare California for threats to critical infrastructure under the unifying coordination of the Office of Emergency Services.
SEC. 2.
Article 6.4 (commencing with Section 8592.30) is added to Chapter 7 of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:
Article  6.4. Cybersecurity
8592.30.
As used in this article, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “Critical infrastructure controls” means networks and systems controlling assets so vital to the state that the incapacity or destruction of those networks, systems, or assets would have a debilitating impact on public health, safety, economic security, or any combination thereof.
(b) “Critical infrastructure information” means information not customarily in the public domain pertaining to any of the following:
(1) Actual, potential, or threatened interference with, or an attack on, compromise of, or incapacitation of critical infrastructure controls by either physical or computer-based attack or other similar conduct, including, but not limited to, the misuse of, or unauthorized access to, all types of communications and data transmission systems, that violates federal, state, or local law or harms public health, safety, or economic security, or any combination thereof.
(2) The ability of critical infrastructure controls to resist any interference, compromise, or incapacitation, including, but not limited to, any planned or past assessment or estimate of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.
(3) Any planned or past operational problem or solution regarding critical infrastructure controls, including, but not limited to, repair, recovery, reconstruction, insurance, or continuity, to the extent it is related to interference, compromise, or incapacitation of critical infrastructure controls.
(c) “Department” means the Department of Technology.
(d) “Office” means the Office of Emergency Services.
(e) “Secretary” means the secretary of each state agency as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 12800.
(f) “State agency” or “state agencies” means the same as “state agency” as set forth in Section 11000.
8592.35.
(a) (1) On or before July 1, 2018, the department shall, in consultation with the office and compliance with Section 11549.3, update the Technology Recovery Plan element of the State Administrative Manual to ensure the inclusion of cybersecurity strategy incident response standards for each state agency to secure its critical infrastructure controls and critical infrastructure information.
(2) In updating the standards in paragraph (1), the department shall consider, but not be limited to considering, all of the following:
(A) Costs to implement the standards.
(B) Security of critical infrastructure information.
(C) Centralized management of risk.
(D) Industry best practices.
(E) Continuity of operations.
(F) Protection of personal information.
(b) Each state agency shall provide the department with a copy of its updated Technology Recovery Plan.
8592.40.
(a) Each state agency shall report on its compliance with the standards updated pursuant to Section 8592.35 to the department in the manner and at the time directed by the department, but no later than July 1, 2019.
(b) The department, in conjunction with the office, may provide suggestions for a state agency to improve compliance with the standards developed pursuant to Section 8592.35, if any, to the head of the state agency and the secretary responsible for the state agency. For a state agency that is not under the responsibility of a secretary, the department shall provide any suggestions to the head of the state agency and the Governor.
8592.45.
The information required by subdivision (b) of Section 8592.35, the report required by subdivision (a) of Section 8592.40, and any public records relating to any communication made pursuant to, or in furtherance of the purposes of, subdivision (b) of Section 8592.40 are confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to any state law, including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1).
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 8592.45 to the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
Preventing public disclosure of the individual cybersecurity preparations and critical infrastructure information of state agencies promotes public safety by prohibiting access to those who would use that information to thwart the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure controls within the state.","(1) The California Emergency Services Act sets forth the duties of the Office of Emergency Services with respect to specified emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response activities within the state. Existing law establishes the Department of Technology under the supervision of the Director of Technology who is also known as the State Chief Information Officer, and generally requires the Department of Technology to be responsible for the approval and oversight of information technology projects by, among other things, consulting with state agencies during initial project planning to ensure that project proposals are based on well-defined programmatic needs. Existing law establishes the Office of Information Security, within the Department of Technology, under the direction of a chief who reports to the Director of Technology.
This bill would require the Department of Technology, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services and compliance with the information security program required to be established by the chief of the Office of Information Security, to update the Technology Recovery Plan element of the State Administrative Manual to ensure the inclusion of cybersecurity strategy incident response standards for each state agency to secure its critical infrastructure controls and critical infrastructure information. The bill would require each state agency to provide its updated Technology Recovery Plan and report on its compliance with these updated standards to the department, as specified, and authorize the department, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to provide suggestions for a state agency to improve compliance with these standards. The bill would define terms for its purposes and make legislative findings in support of its provisions. The bill would prohibit public disclosure of reports and public records relating to the cybersecurity strategies of state agencies, as specified.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to add Article 6.4 (commencing with Section 8592.30) to Chapter 7 of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to state government."

5650.1.
(a) A person who violates Section 5650 is subject to a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for each violation.
(b) The civil penalty imposed for each separate violation pursuant to this section is separate, and in addition to, any other civil penalty imposed for a separate violation pursuant to this section or any other provision of law, except as provided in subdivision (j).
(c) In determining the amount of a civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section, the court shall take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the violation. In making this determination, the court shall consider the degree of toxicity and volume of the discharge, the extent of harm caused by the violation, whether the effects of the violation may be reversed or mitigated, and with respect to the defendant, the ability to pay, the effect of any civil penalty on the ability to continue in business, any voluntary cleanup efforts undertaken, any prior history of violations, the gravity of the behavior, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation, and any other matters the court determines justice may require.
(d) Every civil action brought under this section shall be brought by the Attorney General upon complaint by the department, or by the district attorney or city attorney in the name of the people of the State of California, and any actions relating to the same violation may be joined or consolidated.
(e) In a civil action brought pursuant to this chapter in which a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction is sought, it is not necessary to allege or prove at any stage of the proceeding that irreparable damage will occur if the temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction is not issued, or that the remedy at law is inadequate.
(f) After the party seeking the injunction has met its burden of proof, the court shall determine whether to issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction without requiring the defendant to prove that it will suffer grave or irreparable harm. The court shall make the determination whether to issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction by taking into consideration, among other things, the nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the violation, the quantity and characteristics of the substance or material involved, the extent of environmental harm caused by the violation, measures taken by the defendant to remedy the violation, the relative likelihood that the material or substance involved may pass into waters of the state, and the harm likely to be caused to the defendant.
(g) The court, to the maximum extent possible, shall tailor a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction narrowly to address the violation in a manner that will otherwise allow the defendant to continue business operations in a lawful manner.
(h) All civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall not be considered fines or forfeitures as defined in Section 13003 and shall be apportioned in the following manner:
(1) Fifty percent shall be distributed to the county treasurer of the county in which the action is prosecuted. Amounts paid to the county treasurer shall be deposited in the county fish and wildlife propagation fund established pursuant to Section 13100.
(2) Fifty percent shall be distributed to the department for deposit in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund. These funds may be expended to cover the costs of legal actions or for any other law enforcement purpose consistent with Section 9 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(i) Except as provided in subdivision (j), in addition to any other penalty provided by law, a person who violates Section 5650 is subject to a civil penalty of not more than ten dollars ($10) for each gallon or pound of material discharged. The total amount of the civil penalty shall be reduced for every gallon or pound of the illegally discharged material that is recovered and properly disposed of by the responsible party.
(j) A person shall not be subject to a civil penalty imposed under this section and to a civil penalty imposed pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section 8670.57) of Chapter 7.4 of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code for the same act or failure to act.

This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $10 for each gallon or pound of material discharged. The bill would require that the civil penalty be reduced for every gallon or pound of the illegally discharged material that is recovered and properly disposed of by the responsible party.
The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act establishes various civil penalties for conduct in connection with the intentional or negligent discharging of oil into waters of the state. Existing law requires civil and criminal penalties provided in the act to be separate from, and in addition to, and to not supersede or limit, any and all other remedies, civil or criminal.
This bill would prohibit a person from being subject to both a civil penalty described above and a civil penalty imposed pursuant to the Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act for the same act or failure to act.","An act to amend Section 5650.1 of the Fish and Game Code, and to amend Section 8670.61 of the Government Code, relating to water pollution."

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law prohibits an employer, whether a public agency or private individual or corporation, from asking an applicant for employment to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning an arrest or detention that did not result in a conviction, or information concerning a referral or participation in, any pretrial or posttrial diversion program, except as specified. Existing law also prohibits an employer, as specified, from asking an applicant to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning a conviction that has been judicially dismissed or ordered sealed, except in specified circumstances. Existing law specifies that these provisions do not prohibit an employer at a health facility, as defined, from asking an applicant for a specific type of employment about arrests for certain crimes. Existing law makes it a crime to intentionally violate these provisions.
This bill would also prohibit an employer from asking an applicant for employment to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning or related to an arrest, detention, processing, diversion, supervision, adjudication, or court disposition that occurred while the person was subject to the process and jurisdiction of juvenile court law. The bill, for the purposes of the prohibitions and exceptions described above, would provide that “conviction” excludes an adjudication by a juvenile court or any other court order or action taken with respect to a person who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court law, and would make related and conforming changes. The bill would prohibit an employer at a health facility from inquiring into specific events that occurred while the applicant was subject to juvenile court law, with a certain exception, and from inquiring into information concerning or related to an applicant’s juvenile offense history that has been sealed by the juvenile court. The bill would require an employer at a health facility seeking disclosure of juvenile offense history under that exception to provide the applicant with a list describing offenses for which disclosure is sought.
Because this bill would modify the scope of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 432.7 of the Labor Code, relating to employment."

SECTION 1.
Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:
19851.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) Congress created the federal earned income tax credit (EITC) in 1975 to offset the adverse effects of the Medicare and social security payroll taxes on working poor families and to encourage low-income workers to seek employment rather than welfare.
(b) Due to a relatively low percentage of federal earned income tax credit eligible persons who participate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program, hundreds of millions of federal dollars go unclaimed by the working poor in California.
(c) In 2015, the State of California authorized a state EITC to amplify the poverty-reducing effects of the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians.
(d) In order to alleviate the tax burden on working poor persons and families, to enhance the wages and income of working poor persons and families, to ensure that California receives its share of the federal money available in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program, to ensure that the poorest working Californians access the additional state EITC, and to inject additional federal money into the California economy, the state shall facilitate the furnishing of information to working poor persons and families regarding the availability of the federal and state earned income tax credit so that they may claim those credits on their federal and state income tax returns.
(e) It is the intent of this act to offer the most cost-effective assistance to eligible taxpayers through the following:

State departments or agencies that do not directly communicate with persons or households with persons who may qualify for the federal and the California EITC may communicate indirectly through agencies, districts, or regulated entities that serve eligible persons or households with eligible persons. Departments, agencies, and programs are encouraged to develop the most effective method to provide notice to recipients of federal and California EITC eligibility, as long as the notice contains substantially the same language as the notice described in Section 19854.
(c) The employer shall provide the notification required by subdivision (a) by handing directly to the employee or mailing to the employee’s last known address either of the following:

(a) The notice furnished to employees regarding the availability of the federal and the California EITC shall state as follows:


BASED ON YOUR ANNUAL EARNINGS, YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FEDERAL EITC). THE FEDERAL EITC IS A REFUNDABLE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR LOW-INCOME WORKING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THE FEDERAL EITC HAS NO EFFECT ON CERTAIN WELFARE BENEFITS. IN MOST CASES, FEDERAL EITC PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE USED TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID, SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME, FOOD STAMPS, LOW-INCOME HOUSING, OR MOST TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES PAYMENTS. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT OWE FEDERAL TAXES, YOU MUST FILE A FEDERAL TAX RETURN TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL EITC. BE SURE TO FILL OUT THE FEDERAL EITC FORM IN THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN BOOKLET. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL EITC, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON HOW TO OBTAIN THE IRS NOTICE 797 OR ANY OTHER NECESSARY FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS, CONTACT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE BY CALLING 1-800-829-3676 OR THROUGH ITS WEB SITE AT WWW.IRS.GOV.
YOU ALSO MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (CALIFORNIA EITC) STARTING WITH THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 TAX YEAR. THE CALIFORNIA EITC IS A REFUNDABLE STATE INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR LOW-INCOME WORKING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THE CALIFORNIA EITC IS TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FEDERAL EITC AND GENERALLY WILL NOT BE USED TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR WELFARE BENEFITS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. TO CLAIM THE CALIFORNIA EITC, EVEN IF YOU DO NOT OWE CALIFORNIA TAXES, YOU MUST FILE A CALIFORNIA INCOME TAX RETURN AND COMPLETE AND ATTACH THE CALIFORNIA EITC FORM (FTB 3514). FOR INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE CREDIT, ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, AND HOW TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY CALIFORNIA FORMS AND GET HELP FILING, CONTACT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AT 1-800-852-5711 OR THROUGH ITS WEB SITE AT WWW.FTB.CA.GOV.
(b) The amendments made to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply to notices furnished on or after the effective date of that act.","The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements.
The Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment in excess of that credit amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law, the Earned Income Tax Credit Information Act, requires an employer, as defined, to notify all employees that they may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit, as specified.
This bill would require those same employers currently required to notify employees who may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit to also notify these employees that they may be eligible for the California Earned Income Tax Credit under the same conditions.","An act to amend Sections 19851, 19852, 19853, and 19854 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to tax administration."

SECTION 1.
Section 680.1 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
680.1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1) There is a significant public interest in knowing what percentage of rape
kit biological samples
kits
are analyzed for the perpetrator’s DNA profile, as well as why any untested rape
kit samples
kits
are not analyzed. Currently, there is no mandatory statewide tracking mechanism in place to collect and report these metrics. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section, pursuant to recommendations by the California State Auditor to the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, to correct that.
(2) In 2015, the Department of Justice created the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Tracking (SAFE-T) database to track the status of all sexual assault evidence kits collected in the state based on voluntary data input from law enforcement agencies. It is the intent of the Legislature by enacting this section to require participation in that database.
(b) On a schedule set forth by the Department of Justice, each law enforcement agency that has investigated a case involving the collection of sexual assault kit evidence during the relevant period of time, as determined by the department, shall report to the department, through the SAFE-T database, the data required by the department in its communications to law enforcement. The data shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The number of kits collected during the period.
(2) The number of kits from which one or more biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis.
(3) The number of kits from which a probative DNA profile was generated.
(4) The reason or reasons for not submitting evidence from a given rape kit to a DNA laboratory for processing.
(c) After 120 days following submission of rape kit biological evidence for processing, if a public DNA laboratory has not conducted DNA testing, that laboratory shall provide the reasons for the status in the appropriate SAFE-T data field. If the investigating law enforcement agency has contracted with a private laboratory to conduct DNA testing on rape kit evidence, the submitting law enforcement agency shall provide the 120-day update in SAFE-T. The process described in this subdivision shall take place every 120 days until DNA testing occurs, except as provided in subdivision (d).
(d) Upon expiration of a sexual assault case’s statute of limitations set forth in Section 803, or if a law enforcement agency elects not to analyze the DNA or intends to destroy or dispose of the crime scene evidence pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 680, the investigating law enforcement agency shall state in writing the reason the kit collected as part of that case’s investigation was not analyzed. This written statement relieves the investigating law enforcement agency or public laboratory of any further duty to report information related to that kit pursuant to this section.
(e) The SAFE-T database shall not contain any identifying information about a victim or a suspect, shall not contain any DNA profiles, and shall not contain any information that would impair a pending criminal investigation.
(f) On an annual basis, the Department of Justice shall file a report to the Legislature in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code summarizing data entered into the SAFE-T database during that year. The report shall not reference individual victims, suspects, investigations, or prosecutions. The report shall be made public by the department.
(g) Except as provided in subdivision (f), in order to protect the confidentiality of the SAFE-T database information, SAFE-T database contents shall be confidential and a participating law enforcement agency or laboratory shall not be compelled in a criminal or civil proceeding, except as required by
a law enforcement agency’s duty to produce exculpatory evidence to a criminal defendant,
Brady v. Maryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83,
to provide any SAFE-T database contents to any person or party seeking those records or information.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 680.1 to the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the privacy of victims of crime, it is necessary to keep the information in the SAFE-T database confidential.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law establishes the “Sexual Assault Victims’ DNA Bill of Rights,” which, among other things, encourages a law enforcement agency assigned to investigate specified sexual assault offenses to perform DNA testing of rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence in a timely manner to assure the longest possible statute of limitations. Existing law also requires a law enforcement agency to inform victims of certain unsolved sexual assault offenses if the law enforcement agency elects not to analyze DNA evidence within certain time limits.
This bill would require law enforcement agencies to report information regarding rape kit evidence to the department through a database established by the department. The bill would require that information to include, among other things, the number of kits collected, the number of kits from which one or more biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis, and the number of kits from which a probative DNA profile was generated. The bill would additionally require a public DNA laboratory, or a law enforcement agency contracting with a private laboratory, to provide a reason for not testing a sample every 120 days the sample is untested, except as specified. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the department to file a report to the Legislature on an annual basis summarizing the information in its database. The bill would prohibit law enforcement agencies or laboratories from being compelled to provide any contents of the database in a civil or criminal case, except as required by a law enforcement agency’s duty to produce exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a criminal case.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 680.1 to the Penal Code, relating to DNA evidence."

SECTION 1.
Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to read:
13000.
(a) This part shall be known and may be cited as the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act. The purpose of the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act is to sponsor public educational activities and development of educational materials to ensure that the events surrounding the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry will be remembered, and so that the causes and circumstances of this and similar events may be illuminated and understood.
(b) The Legislature finds and declares that the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was established by Congress in 1980 to “review the facts and circumstances surrounding Executive Order 9066, issued in February 19, 1942, and the impact of such Executive Order on American citizens and permanent residents... and to recommend appropriate remedies.” The CWRIC issued a report of its findings in 1983 with the reports “Personal Justice Denied” and “Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.” The reports were based on information gathered “through 20 days of hearings in cities across the country, particularly the West Coast, hearing testimony from more than 750 witnesses: evacuees, former government officials, public figures, interested citizens, and historians and other professionals who have studied the subjects of Commission inquiry.”
(c) The lessons to be learned from the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II are embodied in “Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.” The CWRIC concluded as follows: “In sum, Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity, and the decisions that followed from it-exclusion, detention, the ending of detention and the ending of exclusion-were not founded upon military considerations. The broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. Widespread ignorance about Americans of Japanese descent contributed to a policy conceived in haste and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan. A grave personal injustice was done to the American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who, without individual review or any probative evidence against them were excluded, removed and detained by the United States during World War II.”
(d) The Legislature further finds and declares that President Ronald Reagan signed into law the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and declared during the signing ceremony that “This is a great day for America.” In that act the Congress declared as follows:
“The Congress recognizes that, as described in the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II. As the Commission documents, these actions were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and intangible, and there were incalculable loses in education and job training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry, the Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation.”

Any school district, county office of education, or any other eligible agency that receives federal legalization impact-assistance funds to provide educational services may administer the test for purposes of determining the need of an eligible foreign national applying for legal status for appropriate educational services, and of allowing an eligible foreign national to demonstrate an understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States. Test results shall be confidential, and shall not be released without the written consent of the eligible foreign national for any purpose that is not directly related to the provision of educational services. Upon request by an eligible foreign national applying for legal status, test results may be transmitted to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. School districts, county offices of education, community colleges, and any other eligible agencies that receive federal funds for this purpose shall administer the test using appropriate test monitor and control procedures and provide for necessary test security measures.

(1) The replacement of the term “alien” with the term “foreign national” when used to refer to an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

This bill would delete the term “resident aliens” from these provisions and replace it with the term “permanent residents.”
(2) Existing law expresses findings of the Legislature with respect to the impact of the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 on illegal aliens. Existing law also states the intent of the Legislature to establish a state test that may be used by eligible aliens to attest to their understanding of English and understanding of the history and government of the United States to meet the requirements of that act. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, to develop the state test referenced above.
This bill would delete the word “illegal” from the legislative findings relating to these aliens.
(3) This bill would also replace the word “alien” with the term “foreign national” in various provisions relating to educational services provided to immigrants, relating to adult education, and relating to the determination of residence for students of specified public postsecondary educational institutions, but this replacement would be operative only if the Superintendent certifies, in writing, to the Secretary of State of California on or before January 20, 2017, that this terminology has been changed in federal law as specified.","An act to amend Sections 13000, 32400, 32401, 52613, 52651, 68062, 68130.5, and 69505 of the Education Code, relating to educational services."

This bill would, with respect to each of the above-described laws, provide that a claim that is otherwise valid that is made in the case in which the amount of tax determined, as defined, has not been paid in full is deemed a timely filed claim for refund with respect to all subsequent payments applied to that determination. The bill would specify that its provisions apply only to claims for refund on or after its effective date.","An act to add Sections 6902.6, 9152.3, 30362.2, 32402.3, 40112.3, 41101.3, 43452.3, 45652.3, 46502.3, 50140.3, 55222.3, and 60522.3 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation."

Nothing in this subdivision limits the liability of any person for his or her tortious conduct.
(b) The legal owner, debt collector, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner, or the agent of any of them, is not liable for any act or omission by a licensed repossession agency, or its agent, in carrying out an assignment or repossession order and is entitled to indemnity from the repossession agency for any loss, damage, cost, or expense, including court costs and attorney’s fees, that the legal owner, debt collector, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner, or the agent of any of them, may reasonably incur as a result thereof. Nothing in this subdivision limits the liability of any person for his or her tortious conduct.
(c) The legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner, or the agent of any of them, is not guilty of a violation of Section 7502.1 or 7502.2 if, at the time of the assignment or repossession order, the party making the assignment or repossession order has in its possession a copy of the repossessor’s current, unexpired repossession agency license, and a copy of the current, unexpired repossession agency’s qualified manager’s certificate, and does not have actual knowledge of any order of suspension or revocation of the license or certificate.

(e) A licensed repossession agency, at least annually, on or before January 31 of each year, shall provide a legal owner from which the agency accepts an assignment or repossession order with a copy of this section, Sections 7500.2, 7507.4, 7507.115, 7507.12, and 7507.125 of this code, and Section 28 of the Vehicle Code.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","(1) The Collateral Recovery Act provides for the licensure and regulation of repossession agencies by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services under the supervision and control of the Director of Consumer Affairs. That act defines the term “repossession” as meaning the locating or recovering of collateral by means of an assignment. That act defines the term “assignment” as any written authorization by the legal owner, lienholder, lessor, lessee, registered owner, or the agent of any of them, to repossess any collateral or any written authorization by an employer to recover any collateral entrusted to an employee or former employee in possession of the collateral. That act provides for the issuance of qualification certificates, required for the management of the places of business of licensed repossession agencies, to applicants who meet certain requirements, including, among others, 2 years of lawful experience in recovering collateral and provides that lawful experience does not include employment performing work other than skip tracing, debt collection, or actual collateral recovery. That act makes a violation of any of its provisions a crime.
This bill would remove debt collection from the employment included under lawful experience. The bill would change the definition of assignment to also include any written authorization to skip trace or locate, would define the term “repossession order” as having the same meaning as “assignment,” and would make conforming changes. The bill would delete the definition for the term “repossession.” By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Under the Collateral Recovery Act, licensed repossession agencies are not liable for specified acts or omissions of a legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, registered owner, or agent of any of them, and are entitled to indemnity from the legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner for losses incurred as a result of those acts or omissions. Under the act, those persons or their agents are not liable for acts or omissions by a licensed repossession agency or its agent in carrying out a repossession order and are entitled to indemnity from the licensed repossession agency for losses incurred as a result of those acts or omissions, as specified.
This bill would extend the above-described provisions applicable to a legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner to a debt collector.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 7500.1, 7504, 7507.3, and 7507.13 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to collateral recovery."

(5) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Corrections Training Fund an amount equal to 7.88 percent of the state penalty funds deposited in the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month. Money in the Corrections Training Fund is not continuously appropriated and shall be appropriated in the Budget Act.
(6) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Local Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders Training Fund established pursuant to Section 11503 an amount equal to 0.78 percent of the state penalty funds deposited in the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month. The amount so transferred shall not exceed the sum of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000) in any fiscal year. The remainder in excess of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000) shall be transferred to the Restitution Fund.

(B) Any moneys deposited in the State Penalty Fund attributable to the assessments made pursuant to subdivision (i) of Section 27315 of the Vehicle Code on or after the date that Chapter 6.6 (commencing with Section 5564) of Part 1 of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed shall be utilized in accordance with paragraphs (1) to (8), inclusive, of this subdivision.

The Board of State and Community Corrections shall develop a grant program for the purpose of making funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program.
14402.
The Body-worn Camera Fund is hereby created. Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, all moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purposes of Section 14400.

For purposes of this section, “unauthorized person” has the same meaning as defined in Section 34564 of the Food and Agricultural Code.","Existing law generally requires local agencies to provide each newly hired police officer and deputy sheriff with a pistol and other specified equipment.
This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to develop a grant program to make funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program. The bill would create the Body-worn Camera Fund, that would continuously appropriate funds to the board for those purposes.
Existing law creates the State Penalty Fund into which moneys collected by the courts from the imposition of fines, forfeitures, or penalties on criminal offenses are deposited. Once a month, certain percentages of money in that fund are transferred into other funds, including, among others, the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund.
This bill would delete the transfer requirement for the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund and instead require a transfer to the Body-worn Camera Fund.
By transferring general fund moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law makes it a felony for an unauthorized person, as defined, to possess, or use, or to obliterate or destroy the brand registration upon, containers, including milk cases, cabinets, or other dairy equipment, which have a value in excess of $950.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision.","An act to amend Section

(c) A coroner shall not be liable for damages in a civil action for any act or omission in compliance with this section.

Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 27491.41 of the Government Code proposed by both this bill and Senate Bill 1189. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, (2) each bill amends Section 27491.41 of the Government Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 1189, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law states that the Legislature finds and declares that sudden infant death syndrome, as defined, is the leading cause of death for children under age one. Existing law requires the coroner to, among other things, perform an autopsy, within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as feasible, in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly.
This bill would define “sudden unexplained death in childhood” as the sudden death of a child one year of age or older but under 18 years of age that is unexplained by the history of the child and for which a thorough postmortem examination fails to demonstrate an adequate cause of death. The bill would require the coroner to notify the parent or responsible adult of a child within that definition about the importance of taking tissue samples. The bill would also exempt the coroner from liability for damages in a civil action for any act or omission done in compliance with these provisions. The bill would make other, nonsubstantive, changes.
By expanding the duties of a local agency, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 27491.41 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 1189, to be operative only if SB 1189 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 27491.41 of, and to add Section 27491.42 to, the Government Code, relating to inquests."

act as the primary administrator for the pilot program.
(3) A county shall be given priority for demonstrating that school districts within its jurisdiction are utilizing moneys from the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants created by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95) to provide training for all school personnel on preventing and recognizing child sexual abuse.
(d) Each participating county is encouraged to efficiently use these funds by giving priority to programs currently serving the needs of at-risk children that meet the criteria in Section 18974.1 and that have demonstrated effectiveness in child sexual abuse prevention or intervention or commercial sexual exploitation prevention or intervention. The funds appropriated under this section shall not supplant or replace any existing funding for programs currently serving the needs of at-risk children, but may only supplement the expansion of existing programs or the collaboration of separate existing programs within the county, or fund newly created programs within the county if no current programs exist to serve the needs of children at risk of sexual abuse or commercial sexual exploitation.
18974.1.
(a) The county board of supervisors of a participating county shall allocate the pilot program funds according to the provisions of this article. The county board of supervisors may delegate the administration of the pilot program funds to the county social services department.
(b) Public or private nonprofit agencies shall be eligible for funding provided that evidence is submitted as part of the application to the county that the proposed services are not duplicated in the community, are based on needs of children at risk, and are supported by a local public agency, including, but not limited to, one of the following:
(1) The county welfare department.
(2) A public law enforcement agency.
(3) The county probation department.
(4) The county board of supervisors.
(5) The county public health department.
(6) The county mental health department.
(7) Any school district.
(c) The administering local agency shall, with oversight and review from the county board of supervisors, include and integrate the pilot program in the county system improvement plan, county self-assessments, and the county plan for other federal and state child abuse prevention programs. To the extent applicable, the county shall provide similar assurances, data, and outcome assessments to the Office of Child Abuse Prevention with respect to the pilot program as are provided regarding other federal and state child abuse prevention programs.
(d) Each participating county shall annually report to the State Department of Social Services, the Assembly Committee on Human Services, and the Senate Committee on Human Services information including, but not limited to, all of the following:
(1) Changing public attitudes or public opinion polls showing increased awareness of prevention techniques for child sexual abuse.
(2) The amount of educational materials distributed to stakeholder groups that address and promote child sexual abuse prevention and prevention techniques.

(4) Identified best practices used by the pilot program that may be replicated and used by other counties, including, but not limited to, community outreach, data collection and analysis, and the creation of educational materials.
18974.2.
This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.","Existing law authorizes the Office of Child Abuse Prevention to fund, through allocations provided to local counties, child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs. Existing law creates the State Children’s Trust Fund in the State Treasury and requires money in the fund to be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for the purpose of funding child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention programs.
This bill would establish the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program as a pilot program in no more than 3 counties, as selected by the State Department of Social Services from among counties that volunteer to participate and based on specified criteria, to provide child sexual abuse prevention and intervention services through public or private nonprofit programs that provide those services. The bill would annually appropriate $50,000 from the General Fund to each county that is selected to conduct a pilot program, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would provide that public or private nonprofit agencies shall be eligible for this funding if specified evidence is provided and would encourage counties to give priority for funding to existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in child sexual abuse prevention or intervention or commercial sexual exploitation prevention or intervention. The bill would require each participating county to annually report to the State Department of Social Services, the Assembly Committee on Human Services, and the Senate Committee on Human Services specified information, including statistics on the increase or decrease of reports of child sexual abuse within the county. These provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2020.","An act to add and repeal Article 7 (commencing with Section 18974) of Chapter 11 of Part 6 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to child sexual abuse, and making an appropriation therefor."

1,000,000 or more ........................
400,000
100,000
(B) “Net worth” for the purposes of this section is defined as the excess of assets over all liabilities and required reserves. The company may carry as an asset the actual cost of its title plant, provided the value ascribed to that asset shall not exceed the aggregate value of all other assets.
(C) If a title plant of an underwritten title company is not currently maintained, the asset value of the plant shall not exceed its asset value as determined in the preceding paragraph as of the date to which that plant is currently maintained, less one-tenth thereof for each succeeding year or part of the succeeding year that the plant is not being currently maintained. For the purposes of this section, a title plant shall be deemed currently maintained so long as it is used in the normal conduct of the business of title insurance, and (i) the owner of the plant continues regularly to obtain and index title record data to the plant or to a continuation thereof in a format other than that previously used, including, but not limited to, computerization of the data, or (ii) the owner of the plant is a participant, in an arrangement for joint use of a title plant system regularly maintained in any format, provided the owner is contractually entitled to receive a copy of the title record data contained in the jointly used title plant system during the period of the owner’s participation therein, either periodically or upon termination of that participation, at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of duplication of the title record data.
(D) An underwritten title company shall at all times maintain current assets of at least ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in excess of its current liabilities, as current assets and liabilities may be defined pursuant to regulations made by the commissioner. In making the regulations, the commissioner shall be guided by generally accepted accounting principles followed by certified public accountants in this state.
(3) (A) An underwritten title company shall obtain from the commissioner a license to transact its business. The license shall not be granted until the applicant conforms to the requirements of this section and all other provisions of this code specifically applicable to the applicant. After issuance the holder of the license shall continue to comply with the requirements as to its business set forth in this code, in the applicable rules and regulations of the commissioner, and in the laws of this state.
(B) An underwritten title company that possesses, or is required to possess, a license pursuant to this section shall be subject as if an insurer to the provisions of Article 8 (commencing with Section 820) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 1 of this code and is deemed to be subject to authorization by the Insurance Commissioner within the meaning of subdivision (e) of Section 25100 of the Corporations Code.
(C) The license may be obtained by filing an application on a form prescribed by the commissioner accompanied by a filing fee of three hundred fifty-four dollars ($354). The license when issued shall be for an indefinite term and shall expire with the termination of the existence of the holder, subject to the annual renewal fee imposed under Sections 12415 and 12416.
(D) An underwritten title company seeking to extend its license to an additional county shall pay a two-hundred-seven-dollar ($207) fee for each additional county, and shall furnish to the commissioner evidence, at least sufficient to meet the minimum net worth requirements of paragraph (2), of its financial ability to expand its business operation to include the additional county or counties.
(4) (A) An underwritten title company shall furnish an audit to the commissioner on the forms provided by the commissioner annually, either on a calendar year basis on or before March 31 or, if approved in writing by the commissioner in respect to any individual company, on a fiscal year basis on or before 90 days after the end of the fiscal year. The time for furnishing any audit required by this paragraph may be extended, for good cause shown, on written approval of the commissioner for a period, not to exceed
60
90
days. Failure to submit an audit on time, or within the extended time that the commissioner may grant, is grounds for an order by the commissioner to accept no new business pursuant to subdivision (d). The audits shall be private, except that a synopsis of the balance sheet on a form prescribed by the commissioner may be made available to the public.
(B) The audits shall be made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent certified public accountant or independent licensed public accountant whose certification or license is in good standing at the time of the preparation. The fee for filing the audit shall be three hundred thirteen dollars ($313).
(C) The commissioner may refuse to accept an audit or order a new audit for any of the following reasons:
(i) An adverse result in any proceeding before the California Board of Accountancy affecting the auditor’s license.
(ii) The auditor has an affiliation with the underwritten title company or any of its officers or directors that would prevent his or her reports on the company from being reasonably objective.
(iii) The auditor has been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony based on his or her activities as an accountant.
(iv) A judgment adverse to the auditor in any civil action finding him or her guilty of fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in the practice of his or her profession.
(D) A company that fails to file an audit or other report on or before the date it is due shall pay to the commissioner a penalty fee of one hundred eighteen dollars ($118) and on failure to pay that or another fee or file the audit required by this section shall forfeit the privilege of accepting new business until the delinquency is corrected.
(c) An underwritten title company may engage in the escrow business and act as escrow agent, provided that:
(1) It maintains a record of all receipts and disbursements of escrow funds.
(2) (A) It maintains a bond satisfactory to the commissioner in the amount set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section. The bond shall run to the state for the use of the state, and for any person who has cause against the obligor of the bond or under the provisions of this chapter.
(B) (i) In lieu of the bond described in subparagraph (A), the company shall maintain a deposit in the amount set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section, and in a form permitted by Section 12351, with the commissioner, who shall immediately make a special deposit in that amount in the State Treasury. The deposit shall be subject to Sections 12353, 12356, 12357, and 12358. As long as there are no claims against the deposit, all interest and dividends thereon shall be paid to the depositor. The deposit shall be security for the same beneficiaries and purposes as the bond, as set forth in subparagraph (A) and in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The deposit shall be maintained until four years after all escrows handled by the depositor have been closed.
(ii) The commissioner may release the deposit prior to the passage of the four-year period described in clause (i) upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the commissioner of either a statutory merger of the depositor into a licensee subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner, or a valid assumption agreement under which the liability of the depositor stemming from escrow transactions handled by it is assumed by a licensee subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner.
(iii) With the foregoing exceptions, the deposit shall be returned to the depositor or lawful successor in interest following the four-year period described in clause (i) upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that there are no claims against the deposit arising out of escrow transactions handled by the depositor. If claims against the deposit are presented to the commissioner, the commissioner may pay a valid claim or claims until the deposit amount is exhausted. If the commissioner has evidence of one or more claims against the depositor, and the depositor is in conservatorship, bankruptcy, or liquidation proceedings, the commissioner may release the deposit to the conservator, trustee, or liquidator. If the depositor is not in conservatorship, bankruptcy or liquidation, the commissioner may interplead the deposit by special endorsement to a court of competent jurisdiction for distribution to claimants on the deposit.
(3) (A) The bond provided by a surety insurer naming the underwritten title company as principal obligor or the letter of credit of an issuing bank shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) The licensee shall faithfully conform to and abide by the provisions of this chapter and all of the rules made by the commissioner under this chapter concerning the conduct of escrow services.
(ii) The licensee will honestly and faithfully apply all funds received, and will faithfully and honestly perform all obligations and undertakings under this chapter, concerning the conduct of escrow services.
(B) In determining the liability of the principal and the sureties under the bond, any money recovered to restore any deficiency in the trust shall not be considered as an asset of the liquidation subject to the assessment for the cost of the liquidation.
(C) The surety under the bond, or the issuing bank of a letter of credit, may pay the full amount of its liability thereunder to the commissioner as conservator, liquidator, receiver, or anyone appointed by the commissioner as a conservator, liquidator, or receiver in lieu of payment to the state or persons having a cause of action against the principal of a bond or applicant under a letter of credit, and upon such payment the surety on the bond, or the issuing bank under a letter of credit shall be completely released, discharged, and exonerated from further liability under the bond or letter of credit, as applicable. The conservator, liquidator, or receiver may use the proceeds of the bond, or letter of credit, for any purposes, including the funding of the costs of conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation.
(D) If there is no reasonable or adequate admitted market for surety bonds as required by this section, the commissioner may act pursuant to Section 1763.1 or, for good cause shown, may permit a letter of credit in lieu thereof, and in the amount of the bond or deposit required by this section. In that case, the commissioner may fashion the letter of credit requirements as appropriate to the circumstances and cause.
(4) On and after July 1, 2016, the commissioner shall promptly release to the depositor, upon application, all escrow-related deposits previously made pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of former Section 12389 if any of the following occurs:
(A) The underwritten title company has provided to the commissioner bond coverage, a deposit, or an approved irrevocable letter of credit as set forth in this subdivision.
(B) Upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the commissioner of either a statutory merger of the underwritten title company depositor into a licensee or certificate holder subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner, or a valid assumption agreement under which all liability of the depositor stemming from escrow transactions handled by it is assumed by a licensee or certificate holder subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner.
(5) Otherwise the deposit shall be promptly returned to the depositor, its duly appointed trustee in bankruptcy or lawful successor in interest upon application for release following the four-year period specified in paragraph (2) , as that paragraph read on June 30, 2016, unless the commissioner has received claims against the deposit stemming from escrow transactions handled by the depositor. If the commissioner has received one or more claims against the depositor, and the depositor is not in conservatorship, bankruptcy, or liquidation, the commissioner may interplead the deposit by special endorsement to a court of competent jurisdiction for distribution on the basis that claims against the depositor stemming from escrow transactions handled by the depositor have priority in the distribution over other claims against the depositor.
(d) The commissioner shall, whenever it appears necessary, examine the business and affairs of a company licensed under this section. The examination shall be at the expense of the company.
(e) (1) At any time that the commissioner determines, after notice and hearing, that a company licensed under this section has willfully failed to comply with a provision of this section, the commissioner shall make his or her order prohibiting the company from conducting its business for a period of not more than one year.
(2) A company that violates the commissioner’s order is subject to seizure under Article 14 (commencing with Section 1010) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 1, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and may have its license revoked by the commissioner. Any person aiding and abetting any company in a violation of the commissioner’s order is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(f) The purpose of this section is to maintain the solvency of the companies subject to this section and to protect the public by preventing fraud and requiring fair dealing. In order to carry out these purposes, the commissioner may make reasonable rules and regulations to govern the conduct of its business of companies subject to this section. The rules and regulations shall be adopted, amended, or repealed in accordance with the procedures provided in Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
(g) The name under which each underwritten title company is licensed shall at all times be an approved name. The fee for filing an application for a change of name shall be one hundred eighteen dollars ($118). Each company shall be subject to the provisions of Article 14 (commencing with Section 1010) and Article 14.5 (commencing with Section 1065.1) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 1.
(h) This section does not prohibit an underwritten title company from engaging in escrow, settlement, or closing activities on properties located outside this state if those activities do not violate the laws of that other state or country.
(i) This section is operative on July 1, 2016.
SECTION 1.
Section 12340.1 of the
Insurance Code
is amended to read:
12340.1.
“Title insurance” means insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying owners of real or personal property or the holders of liens or encumbrances thereon or others interested therein against loss or damage suffered by reason of:
(a)Liens or encumbrances on, or defects in the title to the property;
(b)Invalidity or unenforceability of any liens or encumbrances on the property; or
(c)Incorrectness of searches relating to the title to real or personal property.","Existing law authorizes a company that is a stock corporation to engage in the business of preparing title searches, title reports, title examinations, or certificates or abstracts of title, and to conduct escrow services, if the company, among other things, furnishes audits to the Insurance Commissioner annually on or before March 31, or, if approved in writing by the commissioner, on a fiscal year basis on or before 90 days after the end of the fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the commissioner to extend that deadline, for good cause shown, for a period not to exceed 60 days.
This bill would extend the maximum amount of time permitted for an extension of the deadline to submit an audit to 90 days.
Under existing law, title insurance is defined as insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying an owner of real or personal property or the holder of liens or encumbrances or others who have interests in the property against loss or damage due to liens, encumbrances, or defects in the title to the insured property, defects in liens or encumbrances, or defects in title searches.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","An act to amend Section
12340.1
12389
of the Insurance Code, relating to insurance."
955,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2016.
SEC. 2.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(1) According to data from the United States Census Bureau, full-time working women, on average, over the last decade, have continued to earn just $0.79 for every dollar a man earns. The wage gap is greater for women of color, with African American women being paid an average of $0.60 for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men in 2015 and Latinas being paid just $0.55 for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men in the same year.
(2) This wage disparity amounted to a yearly average wage gap of $10,762 in 2015 between full-time working men and full-time working women. In total, the disparity represents more than $490 billion in lost wages for working women every year.
(3) Disparities in pay for women have numerous negative impacts. This pay differential shortchanges women and their families by thousands of dollars a year and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. Nearly 4 in 10 mothers are primary breadwinners in their households, and nearly two-thirds are significant earners, making pay equity critical to the economic security of their families.
(4) Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental precept in our nation and in California. Federal law, including the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Public Law 88-38), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352), and Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled Equal Employment Opportunity, specifically prohibits arbitrarily compensating men and women differently for the same work, as does California’s Equal Pay Act.
(5) On August 6, 2014, the United States Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require covered federal contractors and subcontractors with more than 100 employees to submit an annual equal pay report on employee compensation. In California, state contractors receiving public money are obligated to comply with equal pay laws and should provide the state with aggregate wage data to advance pay equity.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to promote pay equity and nondiscrimination in setting pay and making hiring or promotional decisions, and to obtain better data on pay equity to more wholly address the problem.
SEC. 3.
Section 12990 of the Government Code is amended to read:
12990.
(a) An employer that is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works or for goods or services is subject to the provisions of this part relating to discrimination in employment and to the nondiscrimination requirements of this section and any rules and regulations that implement it.
(b) (1) (A) Any employer with a contract with the state that amounts to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more that either is required by federal regulations to submit an EEO-1 report to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or has 100 or more employees in the state shall submit a nondiscrimination program to the department and shall submit periodic reports of its compliance with the program, no more than annually, on a schedule to be determined by the department. The department shall make the programs and reports available to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls.
(B) The department may also require an employer that is not described in subparagraph (A) to submit a nondiscrimination program and, if the department so requires, the employer shall comply with the requirements for employers described in subparagraph (A).
(C) The department may require approval and certification of a nondiscrimination program.
(D) The department shall define an employee for the purposes of this paragraph.
(E) An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of employees, premium wage rates for all overtime worked, and regular hourly pay of not less than 30 percent above the state minimum wage rate shall be excluded from calculation of the employer’s total number of employees for purposes of this paragraph.
(2) A nondiscrimination program shall include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, a description of employment selection procedures, and employee compensation data, as follows:
(A) The total number of workers in a specific job category identified by worker race or national origin, and sex.
(B) The total wages required to be reported on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 for all workers in a specific job category identified by worker race or national origin, and sex.
(C) The total hours worked on an annual basis for all workers in a specific job category identified by worker race or national origin, and sex. For purposes of this subdivision, if an employer does not track exempt employees’ hours worked, full-time exempt employees shall be presumed to work 40 hours a week and part-time exempt employees shall be presumed to work 20 hours a week, unless the employer utilizes a different standard number of hours a week for exempt employees, in which case the employer shall report total hours worked on an annual basis by those employees based on that standard number.
(c) Every state contract and subcontract for public works or for goods or services shall contain a nondiscrimination clause prohibiting discrimination on the bases enumerated in this part by contractors or subcontractors. The nondiscrimination clause shall contain a provision requiring contractors and subcontractors to give written notice of their obligations under that clause to labor organizations with which they have a collective bargaining or other agreement. These contractual provisions shall be fully and effectively enforced. This subdivision does not apply to a credit card purchase of goods of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or less. The total amount of exemption authorized herein shall not exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) per year for each company from which a state agency is purchasing goods by credit card. It shall be the responsibility of each state agency to monitor the use of this exemption and adhere to these restrictions on these purchases.
(d) The department shall periodically develop rules and regulations for the application and implementation of this section, and submit them to the council for consideration and adoption in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1. Those rules and regulations shall describe and include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1) Procedures for the investigation, approval, certification, decertification, monitoring, and enforcement of nondiscrimination programs.
(2) The size of contracts or subcontracts below which any particular provision of this section shall not apply.
(3) The circumstances, if any, under which a contractor or subcontractor is not subject to this section.
(4) Criteria for determining the appropriate plant, region, division, or other unit of a contractor’s or subcontractor’s operation for which a nondiscrimination program is required.
(5) Procedures for coordinating the nondiscrimination requirements of this section and its implementing rules and regulations with the California Plan for Equal Opportunity in Apprenticeship, with the provisions and implementing regulations of Article 9.5 (commencing with Section 11135) of Chapter 1 of Part 1, and with comparable federal laws and regulations concerning nondiscrimination, equal employment opportunity, and affirmative action by those who contract with the United States.
(6) The basic principles and standards to guide the department in administering and implementing this section.
(e) Where a contractor or subcontractor is required to prepare an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by a federal compliance agency, including an EEO-1 report that is subject to review by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that program may be submitted with the department, instead of any nondiscrimination program otherwise required by this section or its implementing rules and regulations. Such a program shall constitute a prima facie demonstration of compliance with this section. Where the department or a federal compliance agency has required the preparation of an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by the department or a federal compliance agency, evidence of such a program shall also constitute prima facie compliance with an ordinance or regulation of any city, city and county, or county that requires an employer to submit such a program to a local awarding agency for its approval prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with that agency.
(f) Where the department determines and certifies that the provisions of this section or its implementing rules and regulations are violated or determines a contractor or subcontractor is engaging in practices made unlawful under this part, the department may recommend appropriate sanctions to the awarding agency. Any such recommendation shall take into account the severity of the violation or violations and any other penalties, sanctions, or remedies previously imposed.
(g) The changes to this section made by the act adding this subdivision shall not be construed to negate an exemption to the requirements of this section in existence on January 1, 2017, created by the department through the exercise of its regulatory authority, or to otherwise require the department to reinterpret the validity of an exemption as a result of these changes.","Existing law subjects an employer who is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works, or for goods or services, to various nondiscrimination requirements. Existing law authorizes requiring an employer to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing for approval and certification prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, as well as requiring the provision of periodic reports of contractor or subcontractor compliance with that program. Existing law authorizes a contractor or subcontractor to file an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by a federal compliance agency with the department in lieu of that nondiscrimination program.
This bill would enact the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2016. The bill would require an employer with a contract with the state that amounts to $50,000 or more that either is required by federal regulations to submit an EEO-1 report to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or has 100 or more employees in the state to submit a nondiscrimination program to the department and to submit periodic reports of its compliance with that program, no more than annually, on a schedule to be determined by the department. The bill would require the department to make these programs and reports available to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls. The bill would authorize the department to require approval and certification of the program. The bill would permit the department to require other employers to comply with those program and report submission requirements. The bill would require the department to define an employee for these purposes. The bill would require the nondiscrimination program to include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, a description of employment selection procedures, and employee compensation data, as specified. The bill would specify that a contractor or subcontractor may submit an EEO-1 report subject to review by the EEOC with the department in lieu of the nondiscrimination program. The bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to negate certain exemptions established by regulation that predate its enactment or to require the department to reevaluate the validity of these exemptions, as specified. The bill would make a statement of legislative findings.","An act to amend Section 12990 of the Government Code, relating to discrimination."

(b) A limited packaging permit may be issued by the secretary to a semifrozen (soft-serve) milk products plant for on-premises manufacture and packaging of hard frozen dairy products or hard frozen dairy product novelties. The permit may only be issued after the suitability of the facility for manufacture and packaging has been determined by the secretary. An annual onsite evaluation of compliance with the specific permit conditions shall be completed by the secretary before renewal of the limited packaging permit. A semifrozen milk products plant issued a limited packaging permit shall meet all of the following standards:
(1) The hard frozen products shall only be sold to purchasers for consumption. No hard frozen product manufactured pursuant to the limited packaging permit shall be sold for resale.
(2) All frozen dairy product mixes used for the manufacture and packaging of hard frozen dairy product novelties shall be dispensed from single service containers sealed at the licensed milk products plant where processed and pasteurized. Reconstitution of dry mix or condensed mix is prohibited at a semifrozen milk products plant issued a limited packaging permit.
(3) Adequate facilities, consistent with recognized good manufacturing practices for the production and packaging of hard frozen dairy products, as determined by the secretary, shall be provided as a condition of the limited packaging permit. The facilities shall include, but are not limited to, adequate utensil and novelty mold washing, sterilization and storage, and sufficient sanitary work area, including handwashing facilities, dedicated to the manufacture and packaging of hard frozen dairy product novelties. Sanitation guidelines consistent with good manufacturing and handling practices for retail food establishments manufacturing and packaging hard frozen dairy products in conformance with Part 110 (commencing with Section 110.3) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations shall be utilized by the secretary as a condition for issuance and renewal of the limited packaging permit.
(4) Each individually packaged hard frozen novelty shall be labeled with the name of the product and the name and address of the manufacturer.
(c) Nondairy frozen dessert mix shall be obtained from manufacturers licensed pursuant to Sections 38931 and 38934.

(a) Provide funds for administration and enforcement of this chapter, by assessments to be paid by producers and handlers of market milk in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
(b) Authorize and enable the secretary to prescribe marketing areas and to determine minimum prices to be paid to producers by handlers for market milk that are necessary due to varying factors of costs of production, health regulations, transportation, and other factors in the marketing areas of this state. In determining minimum prices to be paid producers by handlers, the secretary shall endeavor under like conditions to achieve uniformity of cost to handlers for market milk within any marketing area. However, no minimum prices established or determined under this chapter shall be invalid because uniformity of cost to handlers for market milk in any marketing area is not achieved as a result of the minimum producer prices so established or determined.
(c) Authorize and enable the secretary to formulate stabilization and marketing plans, subject to the limitations prescribed in this chapter with respect to the contents of the stabilization and marketing plans, and to declare the plans in effect for any marketing area.

(2) The amount of the assessments so deducted shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month during which such market milk was received.
(b) (1) Every handler subject to the provisions of any stabilization and marketing plan that purchases or handles market milk from producers, including the handler’s own production, if any, shall pay a fee of eight-tenths of one cent ($0.008) per hundredweight of market milk.
(2) The amount of such fee shall be paid to the secretary on or before the 45th day following the last day of the month in which that market milk was received.

Section 51203 of the Government Code is amended to read:
51203.
(a) The assessor shall determine the current fair market value of the land as if it were free of the contractual restriction pursuant to Section 51283. The Department of Conservation or the landowner, also referred to in this section as “parties,” may provide information to assist the assessor to determine the value. Any information provided to the assessor shall be served on the other party, unless the information was provided at the request of the assessor, and would be confidential under law if required of an assessee.
(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessor’s notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4, if the Department of Conservation or the landowner believes that the current fair market valuation certified pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 51283 or Section 51283.4 is not accurate, the department or the landowner may request formal review from the county assessor in the county considering the petition to cancel the contract. The department or the landowner shall submit to the assessor and the other party the reasons for believing the valuation is not accurate and the additional information the requesting party believes may substantiate a recalculation of the property valuation. The assessor may recover his or her reasonable costs of the formal review from the party requesting the review, and may provide an estimate of those costs to the requesting party. The recovery of these costs from the department may be deducted by the city or county from cancellation fees received pursuant to this chapter before transmittal to the Controller for deposit in the Soil Conservation Fund. The assessor may require a deposit from the landowner to cover the contingency that payment of a cancellation fee will not necessarily result from the completion of a formal review. This subdivision shall not be construed as a limitation on the authority provided in Section 51287 for cities or counties to recover their costs in the cancellation process, except that the assessor’s costs of conducting a formal review shall not be borne by the nonrequesting party.
(1) If no request is made within 45 days of receiving notice by certified mail of the valuation, the assessor’s valuation shall be used to calculate the fee.
(2) Upon receiving a request for formal review, the assessor shall formally review his or her valuation if, based on the determination of the assessor, the information may have a material effect on valuation of the property. The assessor shall notify the parties that the formal review is being undertaken and that information to aid the assessor’s review shall be submitted within 30 days of the date of the notice to the parties. Any information submitted to the assessor shall be served on the other party who shall have 30 days to respond to that information to the assessor. If the response to the assessor contains new information, the party receiving that response shall have 20 days to respond to the assessor as to the new information. All submittals and responses to the assessor shall be served on the other party by personal service or an affidavit of mailing. The assessor shall avoid ex parte contacts during the formal review and shall report any such contacts to the department and the landowner at the same time the review is complete. The assessor shall complete the review no later than 120 days of receiving the request.
(3) At the conclusion of the formal review, the assessor shall either revise the cancellation valuation or determine that the original cancellation valuation is accurate. The assessor shall send the revised valuation or notice of the determination that the valuation is accurate to the department, the landowner, and the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract. The assessor shall include a brief narrative of what consideration was given to the items of information and responses directly relating to the cancellation value submitted by the parties. The assessor shall give no consideration to a party’s information or response that was not served on the other party. If the assessor denies a formal review, a brief narrative shall be provided to the parties indicating the basis for the denial, if requested.
(c) For purposes of this section, the valuation date of any revised valuation pursuant to formal review or following judicial challenge shall remain the date of the assessor’s initial valuation, or his or her initial recomputation pursuant to Section 51283.4. For purposes of cancellation fee calculation in a tentative cancellation as provided in Section 51283, or in a recomputation for final cancellation as provided in Section 51283.4, a cancellation value shall be considered current for one year after its determination and certification by the assessor.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department and the landowner may agree on a cancellation valuation of the land. The agreed valuation shall serve as the cancellation valuation pursuant to Section 51283 or Section 51283.4. The agreement shall be transmitted to the board or council considering the petition to cancel the contract.
(e) If the department and landowner agree upon a cancellation value pursuant to subdivision (d) on a contract with a city or county that includes an additional cancellation fee pursuant to Section 51240, the department shall provide a preliminary valuation to the county assessor of the county in which the land is located and the board of supervisors or the city council at least 60 days before the effective date of the final cancellation valuation. The preliminary valuation shall include a description of the rationale and facts considered by the department in determining the cancellation value. The assessor may provide comments on the preliminary valuation to the board of supervisors or city council. The board of supervisors or city council may provide comments on the preliminary valuation and cancellation value, if submitted, to the department. Before determining the final cancellation valuation, the department shall consider the comments of the board or council concerning the preliminary valuation and cancellation valuation, if submitted.
(f) This section represents the exclusive administrative procedure for appealing a cancellation valuation calculated pursuant to this section. The Department of Conservation shall represent the interests of the state in the administrative and judicial remedies for challenging the determination of a cancellation valuation or cancellation fee.","(1) Existing law regulates the production, handling, and marketing of milk and dairy products and requires milk products plants to comply with specified standards and requirements. Existing law authorizes the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to issue a limited packaging permit to a semifrozen milk products plant for on-premises manufacture and packaging of hard frozen dairy products or hard frozen dairy product novelties if certain requirements are satisfied.
This bill would delete a requirement that an establishment be closed to the public when hard frozen dairy product novelties are manufactured and packaged and would delete a requirement that a manufacturer that directly serves frozen yogurt or nondairy frozen dessert on its premises post specified signs on the premises.
(2) Existing law requires certain unfrozen product mixes used in the manufacture of specified frozen dairy products to comply with all of the requirements for ice cream, frozen dairy dessert, or frozen dessert, respectively.
This bill would require frozen yogurt mix to comply with all of the requirements for frozen yogurt.
(3) Existing law requires every milk handler to pay specified assessments and fees to the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to cover the costs of regulating milk. In that regard, existing law requires every milk handler who receives manufacturing milk subject to the milk marketing regulatory requirements or a handler subject to a milk stabilization and marketing plan, including producer-handlers, to deduct a specified assessment from payments made to producers for manufacturing milk or market milk, respectively. Existing law establishes the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund as a special fund, and continuously appropriates moneys in the fund for the administration and enforcement of, among other things, laws regulating the marketing of milk and other dairy products and the stabilization and marketing of market milk.
This bill would, for purposes of those provisions, define the term “educational and research activities” and would additionally provide for the regulation of milk and dairy products-related educational and research activities. The bill would authorize the use of moneys from the above-described assessments and fees for administering and enforcing the manufacturing milk and market milk laws, including the regulation of those educational and research activities. By authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the fund for a new purpose, that is, for milk and dairy-related educational and research activities, the bill would make an appropriation.
(4) Existing law establishes the California Citrus Advisory Committee and requires the committee to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of Food and Agriculture regarding procedures for implementing an inspection program. Existing law requires producers of navel oranges, Valencia oranges, lemons, or mandarin citrus varieties grown in this state and prepared for fresh market in certain counties of the state to pay an assessment, as provided. Existing law requires the assessment to be collected from the producer by the first handler and requires that the assessment be remitted to the Department of Food and Agriculture by the first handler, along with an assessment form, at the end of each month during the marketing season. Existing law requires any handler that does not file the required assessment report and assessments by the 10th day of the month following the month for which the assessment is payable to pay a penalty of 10% of the assessment owed and, in addition, 1.5% interest per month on the unpaid balance.
This bill would instead require a handler to file the required assessment form and pay the assessment and inspection fees by the last day of the month immediately following the month in which the commodities were received and would additionally apply the 10% penalty and 1.5% interest to a failure to pay an inspection fee. The bill would make a handler personally liable for the payment of assessments and inspection fees.
(5) Existing law establishes the California Sheep Commission, comprised of 14 members who are elected or appointed in accordance with specified provisions to serve 2-year terms and limits the terms of office for each member to 4 consecutive terms.
This bill would delete the provision limiting the terms of office of each member to 4 consecutive terms.
(6) The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, also known as the Williamson Act, authorizes a city or county to contract with a landowner for the continued use of the land for agricultural use in exchange for a lower assessed valuation for property tax purposes. Existing law requires the Department of Conservation to provide a preliminary valuation of the land to the county assessor and the city council or county board of supervisors at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the agreed upon cancellation valuation if the contract includes an additional cancellation fee.
This bill would specify that the Department of Conservation is required to provide the preliminary valuation pursuant to those provisions only if the department and landowner agree upon a cancellation value pursuant to a specified provision, as specified.","An act to amend Sections 33704, 36806, 48003, 61345, 61412, 61805, 62211, and 76259 of, to add Section 61306.5 to, and to repeal Section 33704.5 of, the Food and Agricultural Code, and to amend Section 51203 of the Government Code, relating to food and agriculture, and making an appropriation therefor."

958,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In the 1970s, California led the nation in the creation of its licensing system for community care facilities, and pioneered recognition of the special needs of infants and toddlers with a license distinct from preschool-age care.
(b) While the standard of care in California statutes remains appropriate, the bifurcation of early care licensing in California into two separate licenses is unnecessary and problematic.
(c) Many states now mandate the standard required in California, but without dual-licensing. California is one of only two states in the country that employ a separate infant-toddler license. Other states employ a single license for early childhood centers, mandating developmentally appropriate standards based on the age of the children served.
(d) Even in California, family day care homes are not subject to the dual license requirement. Only private fee and state and federally funded child day care facilities are subject to the dual license requirement.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a third facility license option serving children from birth to entering first grade. This additional facility license option shall not replace the current infant license, preschool license, and toddler component option, but instead be in addition to these early care and education facility licensure options.
(f) It is also the intent of the Legislature that all of the following are required under the birth to entering first grade license option:
(1) Children shall be grouped together by their appropriate developmental levels, and appropriate staff-child ratio and group size regulations shall be followed.
(2) Children shall transition from age-appropriate classrooms or program spaces when their developmental level is appropriate for such a move.
(3) A child’s chronological age and the entire group’s need shall also be considering factors for these moves.
(4) All children shall be supervised appropriately by teachers and aides with appropriate staff qualifications. Toddlers may be grouped with either infants or preschoolers as long as the requirements applicable to the youngest age group in the group are followed.
(5) Emphasis shall be placed on improving the quality of early care and education for children from birth to entering first grade in center-based programs.
(6) Long-term efficiency within the Community Care Licensing Division of the State Department of Social Services shall be promoted through the elimination of duplicate paperwork, toddler component waiver processing, and compliance visits to day care centers.
(7) A single inspection visit and administration of the birth to entering first grade day care center shall be implemented versus multiple inspection visits and administration of a day care center with an infant license or preschool license and a toddler component option. This will increase efficiency and allow a department analyst to more holistically evaluate the birth to entering first grade day care center, which will lead to stronger health and safety practices. The efficiencies gained will reduce cost pressure on the department and allow more providers to operate in California, and thus open more spaces for children and parents waiting for care.
(g) The ability for providers to choose which type of facility license option best meets their specific programmatic contract, business, and community needs will allow for more flexibility in the planning for a successful operation of the center.
SEC. 2.
Section 1596.951 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
1596.951.
(a) The department shall, in consultation with stakeholders through the regulatory process, adopt regulations on or before January 1, 2018, to develop and implement a birth to entering first grade license option for day care centers. Regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall include all of the following:
(1) Age-appropriate transition periods that do all of the following:
(A) Allow children to transition from one age group to another age group up to three months before or three months after their birthday.
(B) Take the needs of the whole age group into consideration in order to move children together.
(C) Consider continuity of care of the children and parents being served.
(D) Consider the needs of the day care center licensees to maximize spaces being used.
(2) A requirement that when a birth to entering first grade license option is being issued to a new or current day care center licensee, the licensee shall list the age groups of children being served at the day care center for the purposes of license inspections, data collection management, and county needs assessments.
(3) A requirement that all other licensing regulations that apply to a day care center shall also apply to a birth to entering first grade license option.
(b) (1) A new applicant for a birth to entering first grade license option may be charged a fee commensurate with the other age specific facility license fee schedules.
(2) Until an existing day care center license has been replaced with a birth to entering first grade license option, a day care center licensee shall maintain a day care center that meets regulatory standards for the age groups of children that are being cared for at the day care center, and standards for inspection of a day care center shall be based on the current license.
(c) Stakeholders consulted in adopting regulations pursuant to this section shall include, but are not limited to, the State Department of Education, California Association for the Education of Young Children, Early Edge California, First 5 California, Children Now, Alliance for Early Success, California Head Start Association, California Child Development Administrators Association, California Child Care Resource and Referral Network, California Child Care Coordinators Association, Infant Development Association, the Western Office of Zero to Three, L.A. Alliance, Professional Association for Childhood Education, Californians for Quality Early Learning, WestEd, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Title 5 and Head Start-funded center-base child care providers, and private fee -for-service center-based child care providers.","Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of day care centers by the State Department of Social Services. Existing regulations require a separate license to be issued for each component of a combination center, and establishes teacher-child ratio requirements.
This bill would require the department to, in consultation with specified stakeholders, adopt regulations on or before January 1, 2018, to develop and implement a birth to entering first grade license option for day care centers. The bill would require the regulations to include age-appropriate transition times, as specified, a requirement that a single integrated license option list the age groups of children being served at the day care center, and a requirement that all other licensing regulations that apply to a day care center shall also apply to a birth to entering first grade license option. The bill would require, until a day care center has the new integrated license, standards for inspection of a day care center to be based on the current license.","An act to add Section 1596.951 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to care facilities."

SECTION 1.
Section 6601 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
6601.
(a) (1) Whenever the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determines that an individual who is in custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and who is either serving a determinate prison sentence or whose parole has been revoked, may be a sexually violent predator, the secretary shall, at least six months prior to that individual’s scheduled date for release from prison, refer the person for evaluation in accordance with this section. However, if the inmate was received by the department with less than nine months of his or her sentence to serve, or if the inmate’s release date is modified by judicial or administrative action, the secretary may refer the person for evaluation in accordance with this section at a date that is less than six months prior to the inmate’s scheduled release date.
(2) A petition may be filed under this section if the individual was in custody pursuant to his or her determinate prison term, parole revocation term, or a hold placed pursuant to Section 6601.3, at the time the petition is filed. A petition shall not be dismissed on the basis of a later judicial or administrative determination that the individual’s custody was unlawful, if the unlawful custody was the result of a good faith mistake of fact or law. This paragraph shall apply to any petition filed on or after January 1, 1996.
(b) The person shall be screened by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Board of Parole Hearings based on whether the person has committed a sexually violent predatory offense and on a review of the person’s social, criminal, and institutional history. This screening shall be conducted in accordance with a structured screening instrument developed and updated by the State Department of State Hospitals in consultation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. If as a result of this screening it is determined that the person is likely to be a sexually violent predator, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall refer the person to the State Department of State Hospitals for a full evaluation of whether the person meets the criteria in Section 6600.
(c) The State Department of State Hospitals shall evaluate the person in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol, developed and updated by the State Department of State Hospitals, to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator as defined in this article. The standardized assessment protocol shall require assessment of diagnosable mental disorders, as well as various factors known to be associated with the risk of reoffense among sex offenders. Risk factors to be considered shall include criminal and psychosexual history, type, degree, and duration of sexual deviance, and severity of mental disorder.
(d) Pursuant to subdivision (c), the person shall be evaluated by two practicing psychiatrists or psychologists, or one practicing psychiatrist and one practicing psychologist, designated by the Director of State Hospitals. If both evaluators concur that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody, the Director of State Hospitals shall forward a request for a petition for commitment under Section 6602 to the county designated in subdivision (i). Copies of the evaluation reports and any other supporting documents shall be made available to the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) who may file a petition for commitment.
(e) If one of the professionals performing the evaluation pursuant to subdivision (d) does not concur that the person meets the criteria specified in subdivision (d), but the other professional concludes that the person meets those criteria, the Director of State Hospitals shall arrange for further examination of the person by two independent professionals selected in accordance with subdivision (g).
(f) If an examination by independent professionals pursuant to subdivision (e) is conducted, a petition to request commitment under this article shall only be filed if both independent professionals who evaluate the person pursuant to subdivision (e) concur that the person meets the criteria for commitment specified in subdivision (d). The professionals selected to evaluate the person pursuant to subdivision (g) shall inform the person that the purpose of their examination is not treatment but to determine if the person meets certain criteria to be involuntarily committed pursuant to this article. It is not required that the person appreciate or understand that information.
(g) Any independent professional who is designated by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of State Hospitals for purposes of this section shall not be a state government employee, shall have at least five years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, and shall include psychiatrists and licensed psychologists who have a doctoral degree in psychology. The requirements set forth in this section also shall apply to any professionals appointed by the court to evaluate the person for purposes of any other proceedings under this article.
(h) (1) If the State Department of State Hospitals determines that the person is a sexually violent predator as defined in this article, the Director of State Hospitals shall forward a request for a petition to be filed for commitment under this article to the county designated in subdivision (i) no less than 20 calendar days prior to the scheduled release date of the person. Copies of the evaluation reports and any other supporting documents shall be made available to the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) who may file a petition for commitment in the superior court.
(2) If a hold is placed pursuant to Section 6601.3 and the State Department of State Hospitals determines that the person is a sexually violent predator as defined in this article, the Director of State Hospitals shall forward a request for a petition to be filed for commitment under this article to the county designated in subdivision (i) no less than 20 calendar days prior to the end of the hold.
(3) The person shall have no right to enforce the time limit set forth in this subdivision and shall have no remedy for its violation.
(i) If the county’s designated counsel concurs with the recommendation, a petition for commitment shall be filed in the superior court of the county in which the person was convicted of the offense for which he or she was committed to the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The petition shall be filed, and the proceedings shall be handled, by either the district attorney or the county counsel of that county. The county board of supervisors shall designate either the district attorney or the county counsel to assume responsibility for proceedings under this article.
(j) An order issued by a judge pursuant to Section 6601.5, finding that the petition, on its face, supports a finding of probable cause to believe that the individual named in the petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release, shall toll that person’s parole pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 3000 of the Penal Code, if that individual is determined to be a sexually violent predator.
(k) Pursuant to subdivision (d), the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) shall notify the State Department of State Hospitals of its decision regarding the filing of a petition for commitment within 15 days of making that decision.
SEC. 2.
Section 6601.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
6601.3.
(a) Upon a showing of good cause, the Board of Parole Hearings may order that a person referred to the State Department of State Hospitals pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 6601 remain in custody for no more than 45 days beyond the person’s scheduled release date for full evaluation pursuant to subdivisions (c) to (i), inclusive, of Section 6601.
(b) For purposes of this section, good cause means circumstances where there is a recalculation of credits or a restoration of denied or lost credits by any custodial agency or court, a resentencing by a court, the receipt of the prisoner into custody, or equivalent exigent circumstances that result in there being less than 45 days prior to the person’s scheduled release date for the full evaluation described in subdivisions (c) to (i), inclusive, of Section 6601.","Existing law requires the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to refer a person who is in custody under that department’s jurisdiction, who is serving a determinate sentence or whose parole has been revoked, for evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals if the secretary determines that the person may be a sexually violent predator. Existing law establishes a screening process for the department and the Board of Parole Hearings to determine whether a person has committed a sexually violent offense, and to determine if the person is likely to be a sexually violent predator prior to referral to the State Department of State Hospitals for a full evaluation. Existing law authorizes the board, upon a showing of good cause, as defined, to order that the person referred to the State Department of State Hospitals remain in custody for no more than 45 days beyond the person’s scheduled release date for full evaluation. Existing law requires, if the State Department of State Hospitals determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, as defined, the Director of State Hospitals to forward a request to a specified county for a petition to be filed for the person to be committed to a facility for mental health treatment.
This bill would require the Director of State Hospitals to forward the request no less than 20 calendar days prior to the scheduled release date of the person or, if the person is ordered by the board to remain in custody beyond the person’s scheduled release date, no less than 20 calendar days prior to the end of that hold. The bill would modify the definition of “good cause” in the above provision. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","An act to amend Sections 6601 and 6601.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to mental health."
961,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Fix Our Roads Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to the Governor, California faces a $5.7 billion annual shortfall in funding state highway maintenance and rehabilitation. Local governments have identified an additional $7.8 billion annual shortfall for maintaining local streets and roads.
(b) Ensuring the safe and efficient movement of goods and people is a fundamental role of government. California has neglected its roads and highways. According to the Department of Transportation (Caltrans), more than 15 percent of the state’s 50,000 miles of state highways are characterized as “distressed,” and require substantial rehabilitation and reconstruction work. An additional 25 percent of the state highway system is in need of corrective maintenance.
(c) California is ranked 45th in the United States by the Reason Foundation’s 21st Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems for overall highway condition and performance.
(d) According to The Road Information Program, a national transportation research group, congestion-related delays cost California motorists $20.4 billion every year. In Los Angeles and the Bay Area, the average motorist loses 61 hours due to congestion each year, costing $1,300 in lost time and wasted fuel. In the commercial sector, $1.34 trillion in goods are shipped from sites in California. According to the American Transportation Research Institute, traffic congestion in California adds over $1.7 billion annually in operational costs for the commercial trucking sector.
(e) According to the American Petroleum Institute, Californians pay the fourth highest gas tax in the nation.
(f) In 2015, the state’s cap-and-trade program was expanded to cover transportation fuels. According to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, this added an additional 10 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas. The Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates this tax will grow automatically to between 13 cents and 20 cents per gallon over the next five years. When this “hidden tax” is included, Californians pay the highest gas tax in the nation.
(g) This hidden tax on gasoline will generate between $1 billion and $3 billion per year in new revenue. None of this revenue supports road maintenance and rehabilitation.
(h) During the last recession, the Legislature diverted approximately $1 billion per year in truck weight fees from funding road maintenance and rehabilitation to backfill the state’s General Fund.
(i) General Fund spending grew by more than $15 billion between the 2013–14 and 2015–16 fiscal years. The weight fee diversion has not been reversed, and none of this new spending directly supported road maintenance or rehabilitation projects.
(j) The Legislative Analyst projects the state will have an $11.5 billion surplus in the 2016–17 fiscal year.
(k) The Legislature borrowed $482 million from the state’s Traffic Congestion Relief Program in 2001. None of this loan has been repaid.
(l) The Legislature is funding construction of a $68-billion-high-speed rail project. If constructed, this project would reduce traffic congestion by only 1 percent. In addition to more than $500 million per year in cap-and-trade revenue, taxpayers will pay $650 million per year in bond debt service over the next 30 years to fund this project.
(m) California does not spend existing road funds efficiently. The cost of meeting the state’s highway maintenance needs has nearly tripled over 10 years, while gas tax revenue for maintenance has remained steady. In May 2014, the Legislative Analyst released a review of staff support costs at Caltrans. The report determined that Caltrans is overstaffed by 3,500 full-time employees, at a cost of more than $500 million per year.
(n) Gas taxes and vehicle registration fees are regressive, and disproportionately harm low-income and middle class working families. Lower income Californians drive less fuel efficient vehicles, and commute longer distances due to the state’s lack of affordable housing.
(o) According to the American Automobile Association, Californians already pay the highest gas prices in the nation.
(p) The Governor proposes placing 1,500,000 zero-emission vehicles on California’s roads by 2025. Electric vehicle owners are disproportionately wealthy, and do not contribute any gas tax to pay for road maintenance and rehabilitation. According to an October 2015 University of California, Berkeley, study, the wealthiest 20 percent of households capture 90 percent of federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases.
(q) Because electric vehicle owners do not pay gas tax, increasing the gas tax shifts the burden for roadway maintenance to lower income Californians.
(r) In September 2015, the Governor proposed a $500 million gas tax increase, and a $2 billion vehicle registration fee increase, to fund road maintenance and rehabilitation. The $65 registration fee increase would more than double the existing base registration fee.

A special election is hereby called to be held throughout the state on November 8, 2016. The special election shall be consolidated with the statewide general election to be held on that date. The consolidated election shall be held and conducted in all respects as if there were only one election and only one form of ballot shall be used.
SEC. 4.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 9040 of the Elections Code, the Secretary of State shall submit the following advisory question to the voters at the November 8, 2016, consolidated election:
“Shall the California Legislature disproportionately target low-income and middle class families with a regressive tax increase on gasoline and annual vehicle registrations to fund road maintenance and rehabilitation, rather than ending the diversion of existing transportation tax revenues for nontransportation purposes, investing surplus state revenue in transportation infrastructure, repaying funds borrowed from transportation accounts, prioritizing roads over high-speed rail, and eliminating waste at the Department of Transportation?”
(b) The provisions of the Elections Code that apply to the preparation of ballot measures and ballot materials at a statewide election apply to the measure submitted pursuant to this section.
SEC. 5.
(a) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 9040, 9043, 9044, 9061, 9082, and 9094 of the Elections Code or any other law, the Secretary of State shall submit Section 4 of this act to the voters at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 13115 of the Elections Code, Section 4 of this act and any other measure placed on the ballot by the Legislature for the November 8, 2016, statewide general election after the 131-day deadline set forth in Section 9040 of the Elections Code shall be placed on the ballot, following all other ballot measures, in the order in which they qualified as determined by chapter number.
(c) The Secretary of State shall include, in the ballot pamphlets mailed pursuant to Section 9094 of the Elections Code, the information specified in Section 9084 of the Elections Code regarding the ballot measure contained in Section 4 of this act.

(2) Before issuing a temporary certificate of clearance pursuant to Section 44332.5, a school district shall obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission and shall not issue a temporary certificate of clearance if the applicant has been convicted of a violent or serious felony.
(b) This section applies to any violent or serious offense which, if committed in this state would have been punishable as a violent or serious felony.
(c) For purposes of this section, a violent felony is any felony listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code and a serious felony is any felony listed in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 of the Penal Code.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a person shall not be denied a temporary certificate or a temporary certificate of clearance solely on the basis that he or she has been convicted of a violent or serious felony if the person has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 4852.01) of Title 6 of Part 3 of the Penal Code.

Article 15 (commencing with Section 44405) is added to Chapter 2 of Part 25 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:
Article  15. Nonpublic, Nonsectarian Schools
44405.
(a) A county board of education or city and county board of education may issue temporary certificates for the purpose of authorizing salary payments to certified employees of nonpublic, nonsectarian schools, including individuals certified in another state, whose credential applications are being processed by the commission. However, the individuals must have demonstrated proficiency in basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills pursuant to the requirements of Section 44252.5. The applicant for a temporary certificate shall make a statement that he or she has duly filed an application with the commission for a credential or permit together with the required fee and that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no reason exists why a certificate or permit should not be issued. The certificate or permit shall be valid for not more than one calendar year from the date of issuance.
(b) The county board of education or city and county board of education shall cancel the temporary certificate or permit, providing notification to the applicant and the nonpublic, nonsectarian school specified on the temporary certificate or permit, immediately upon receipt of certification in writing from the commission that the applicant apparently does not possess adequate academic qualifications or apparently has a criminal record that would disqualify the applicant.
(c) A temporary certificate issued to a permit applicant is not valid beyond the time that the commission either issues or denies the originally requested permit. A temporary certificate issued to a credential applicant is not valid beyond the time that the commission provides written notification to the county board of education or city and county board of education that the applicant apparently does not possess adequate qualifications or that the commission has received facts that may cause denial of the application, or beyond the time that the commission either issues or denies the originally requested credential.
(d) A county board of education or city and county board of education may not issue a temporary certificate to an applicant whose teaching credential is revoked or suspended.
(e) For purposes of this article, “nonpublic, nonsectarian school” has the same meaning as defined in Section 56034.
44406.
(a) Before issuing a temporary certificate pursuant to Section 44405, a county board of education or city and county board of education shall obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission.
(b) The conditions under which a temporary certificate issued pursuant to Section 44405 may or shall be revoked, issued, or denied, as applicable, shall be the same for nonpublic, nonsectarian schools as for schools operated by local educational agencies, as provided in Article 8 (commencing with Section 44330).
44407.
The commission shall honor requests to expedite the processing of applications for teacher credentialing received from the department on behalf of an applicant employed or seeking employment at a nonpublic, nonsectarian school to the same degree the commission honors requests to expedite the processing of applications for teacher credentialing received from another employing agency.
44408.
The department shall recognize the authority of all teacher permits, credentials, and certificates issued by the commission or a county board of education or city and county board of education authorized by this article.
44409.
This article shall become inoperative on July 1, 2024, and, as of January 1, 2025, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2025, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.","(1) Existing law authorizes a county board of education or city and county board of education to issue temporary certificates to certified employees whose credentials are being processed by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Under existing law, a county board of education or city and county board of education, before issuing a temporary certificate, or a school district, before issuing a temporary certificate of clearance, is required to obtain a criminal record summary about the applicant from the Department of Justice.
This bill instead would authorize a county board of education or city and county board of education to issue temporary certificates to certified employees, including individuals certified in another state, whose credentials are being processed by the commission. The bill would require a county board of education or city and county board of education, before issuing a temporary certificate, or a school district, before issuing a temporary certificate of clearance, to instead obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission.
(2) Existing law authorizes certain school districts, at their discretion, to provide for the registration of a valid certification or other document authorizing the holder to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications as an employee of the school district.
This bill would prohibit a school district from exercising that authority until the school district has obtained a certificate of clearance from the commission.
(3) Existing law authorizes a local educational agency to contract with a nonpublic, nonsectarian school to provide the appropriate special educational facilities, special education, or designated instruction and services required by a pupil with exceptional needs if no appropriate public education program is available.
This bill would authorize a county board of education or city and county board of education to issue temporary certificates to certified employees of nonpublic, nonsectarian schools, including individuals certified in another state, whose credentials are being processed by the commission, as provided. The bill would require a county board of education or city and county board of education, before issuing a temporary certificate, to obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission. The bill would provide that the conditions under which a temporary certificate issued pursuant to these provisions may or shall be revoked, issued, or denied, as applicable, are to be the same for nonpublic, nonsectarian schools as for schools operated by local educational agencies.
The bill would require the commission to honor requests to expedite teacher credentialing processing from the State Department of Education on behalf of an applicant employed or seeking employment at a nonpublic, nonsectarian school to the same degree the commission honors requests to expedite the processing of applications for teacher credentialing received from other employing agencies.
The bill would require the State Department of Education to recognize all teacher permits, credentials, and certificates issued by the commission or a county board of education or city and county board of education authorized by this bill.
The bill would make these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2024, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2025.","An act to amend Sections 44332, 44332.5, and 44332.6 of, and to add and repeal Article 15 (commencing with Section 44405) of Chapter 2 of Part 25 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Education Code, relating to teacher credentialing."

SECTION 1.
Section 50199.10 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
50199.10.
(a) For purposes of allocating low-income housing credits, the committee is hereby designated as this state’s only housing credit agency for purposes of Section 42(h) of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(h)). The committee shall annually determine and shall allocate the state ceiling in accordance with this chapter and in conformity with federal law. The committee shall determine the housing credit ceiling as soon as possible following the effective date of this chapter and thereafter following the commencement of each calendar year. The committee shall undertake any and all responsibilities of housing credit agencies under Section 42 of Title 26 of the United States Code, including entering into regulatory agreements relating to projects that are granted awards.
(b) The committee shall develop and provide application forms for use by housing credit applicants. The committee shall adopt uniform procedures for submission and review of applications of housing credit applicants, including fees to defray the committee’s costs in administering this chapter. In the committee’s discretion, the fees shall be charged to a housing credit applicant as a condition of submitting an application or as a condition of receiving an allocation or reservation of the state’s current or anticipated housing credit ceiling, or both.
(c) In addition to allocating the current housing credit ceiling, the committee may reserve a portion of the state’s anticipated housing credit ceiling for a subsequent year for a housing credit applicant.
(d) As a condition to making an allocation of the housing credit ceiling or a reservation of the anticipated housing credit ceiling for a subsequent year, the committee may require the housing credit applicant receiving the allocation or reservation to deposit with the committee an amount of money as a good-faith undertaking. The committee shall adopt policies for determining when deposits will be required, prescribing procedures for return of deposits, and specifying the circumstances under which the deposits will be forfeited in whole or in part for failure to timely utilize the allocation or reservation provided to the housing credit applicant.
(e) (1) The committee may make any allocation or reservation of the state’s housing credit ceiling to a housing credit applicant subject to terms and conditions in furtherance of the purposes of this part. The committee may condition an allocation or reservation on the execution of a contract between the housing credit applicant and the committee requiring the housing credit applicant to comply with all the terms of Section 42 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, any applicable state laws, and any additional requirements the committee deems necessary or appropriate to serve the purposes of this chapter, and providing for legal action to obtain specific performance or monetary damages for breach of contract.
(2) No allocations or reservations shall be made pursuant to this subdivision with respect to projects that do not meet the requirements of the qualified allocation plan, and no allocations or reservations shall be made in amounts that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (2) of subsection (m) of Section 42 of Title 26 of the United States Code.
(3) (A) With respect to an allocation or reservation, the committee may establish a schedule of fines for violations of the terms and conditions, the regulatory agreement, other agreements, or program regulations. In developing the schedule of fines, the committee shall establish the fines for violations in an amount up to five hundred dollars ($500) per violation or double the amount of the financial gain because of the violation, whichever is greater. Except for serious violations, which shall be defined by the committee, a first-time property owner violator shall be given at least 30 days to correct the violation before a fine is imposed. A violation that has occurred for some time prior to discovery is one violation, but fines may be a recurring amount if the violation is not corrected within a reasonable period of time thereafter, as determined by the committee. A property owner may appeal a fine to the committee.
(B) By resolution at a public general committee meeting, the committee shall adopt and may revise the schedule of fines, which shall include specific violations of the terms and conditions, the regulatory agreement, other agreements, or program regulations and fine amounts subject to the criteria in subparagraph (A).
(C) All fines received by the committee shall be deposited in the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund established in Section 50661.
(D) If a fine assessed against a property owner is not paid within six months from the date when the fine was initially assessed by the committee and after reasonable notice has been provided to the property owner, the committee may record a lien against the property. Consistent with Sections 1214 and 1215 of the Civil Code, a lien created pursuant to this paragraph shall not be superior to any lien recorded prior to the recording of this lien.","Under existing law, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee administers the federal and state low-income housing tax credit programs. Existing law requires the committee to allocate the housing credit on a specified regular basis and requires the committee to only allocate credits to a project if the housing sponsor enters into a specified regulatory agreement. Existing law authorizes the committee to make any allocation or reservation of the state’s housing credit ceiling to a housing credit applicant subject to specified terms and conditions.
Existing law establishes the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund, which is continuously appropriated to the Department of Housing and Community Development, to fund various housing-related purposes.
This bill would authorize the committee to establish a specified schedule of fines for violations of the terms and conditions, the regulatory agreement, other agreements, or program regulations. The bill would require the committee to define serious violations and, except for serious violations, would require a first-time property owner violator to be given the opportunity to correct the violation before the fine is imposed. The bill would authorize a property owner to appeal a fine to the committee. The bill would require these fines to be deposited in the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund and would authorize the committee to record a property lien if the fine has not been paid within a specified period of time. By depositing these fines into the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.","An act to amend Section 50199.10 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, and making an appropriation therefor."

Section 11658.5 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
11658.5.
(a) (1) An insurer that intends to use a dispute resolution or arbitration agreement to resolve disputes arising in California out of a workers’ compensation insurance policy or endorsement issued to a California employer shall disclose to the employer, contemporaneously with any written quote that offers to provide insurance coverage, that choice of law and choice of venue or forum may be a jurisdiction other than California and that these terms are negotiable between the insurer and the employer. The disclosure shall be signed by the employer as evidence of receipt if the employer accepts the offer of coverage from that insurer.
(2) After compliance with paragraph (1), a dispute resolution or arbitration agreement may be negotiated by the insurer and the employer before any dispute arises.
(b) Nothing in this section is intended to interfere with any authority granted to the Insurance Commissioner under current law.
(c) Failure by the insurer to observe the requirements of subdivision (a) shall result in a default to California as the choice of law and forum for resolution of disputes arising in California.
(d) For purposes of this section, a “California employer” means an employer whose principal place of business is in California and whose California payroll constitutes the majority of the employer’s payroll for purposes of determining premium under the policy.
(e) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2022.","Existing law prohibits a workers’ compensation insurance policy or endorsement from being issued by an insurer unless the insurer files a copy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization and 30 days have expired from the date the form or endorsement is received by the Insurance Commissioner from the rating organization without notice from the commissioner, unless the commissioner gives written approval of the form or the endorsement prior to that time.
This bill would prohibit an ancillary agreement, as defined, to a workers’ compensation insurance policy from being issued by an insurer to a California employer, as defined, unless the insurer files a copy of the ancillary agreement with a rating organization and 30 days have expired from the date the ancillary agreement is received by the commissioner from the rating organization without notice from the commissioner unless the commissioner gives written approval of the ancillary agreement prior to that time. The prohibition would not apply to an ancillary agreement between an insurer and a California employer issued in conjunction with a workers’ compensation policy or endorsement that contains a deductible obligation or retrospectively rated loss limitation and meets specified criteria. The bill would authorize an insurer to use such an ancillary agreement and would require an insurer to submit a copy of that ancillary agreement to the commissioner within 30 days of issuing the ancillary agreement. The bill would provide that the terms and conditions of a workers’ compensation policy and any endorsements take precedence over the provisions contained in an ancillary agreement in the case of an inconsistency or conflict between the policy or endorsement and the ancillary agreement. The bill would make additional changes relating to collateral and security agreements, as defined. The changes made by the bill would apply to ancillary agreements issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2017. The bill would also make conforming changes.
The changes made by the bill would apply only until January 1, 2022.","An act to amend, repeal, and add Sections 11658 and 11658.5 of the Insurance Code, relating to workers’ compensation insurance."
966,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1777.5 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
1777.5.
(a) This chapter does not prevent the employment of properly registered apprentices upon public works.
(b) (1) Every apprentice employed upon public works shall be paid the prevailing rate of per diem wages for apprentices in the trade to which he or she is registered and shall be employed only at the work of the craft or trade to which he or she is registered.
(2) Unless otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement, when a contractor requests the dispatch of an apprentice pursuant to this section to perform work on a public works project and requires the apprentice to fill out an application or undergo testing, training, an examination, or other preemployment process as a condition of employment, the apprentice shall be paid for the time spent on the required preemployment activity, including travel time to and from the required activity, if any, at the prevailing rate of per diem wages for apprentices in the trade to which he or she is registered. Unless otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement, a contractor is not required to compensate an apprentice for the time spent on preemployment activities if the apprentice is required to take a preemployment drug or alcohol test and he or she fails to pass that test.
(c) Only apprentices, as defined in Section 3077, who are in training under apprenticeship standards that have been approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards and who are parties to written apprentice agreements under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3070) of Division 3 are eligible to be employed at the apprentice wage rate on public works. The employment and training of each apprentice shall be in accordance with either of the following:
(1) The apprenticeship standards and apprentice agreements under which he or she is training.
(2) The rules and regulations of the California Apprenticeship Council.
(d) If the contractor to whom the contract is awarded by the state or any political subdivision, in performing any of the work under the contract, employs workers in any apprenticeable craft or trade, the contractor shall employ apprentices in at least the ratio set forth in this section and may apply to any apprenticeship program in the craft or trade that can provide apprentices to the site of the public work for a certificate approving the contractor under the apprenticeship standards for the employment and training of apprentices in the area or industry affected. However, the decision of the apprenticeship program to approve or deny a certificate shall be subject to review by the Administrator of Apprenticeship. The apprenticeship program or programs, upon approving the contractor, shall arrange for the dispatch of apprentices to the contractor. A contractor covered by an apprenticeship program’s standards shall not be required to submit any additional application in order to include additional public works contracts under that program. “Apprenticeable craft or trade,” as used in this section, means a craft or trade determined as an apprenticeable occupation in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the California Apprenticeship Council. As used in this section, “contractor” includes any subcontractor under a contractor who performs any public works not excluded by subdivision (o).
(e) Before commencing work on a contract for public works, every contractor shall submit contract award information to an applicable apprenticeship program that can supply apprentices to the site of the public work. The information submitted shall include an estimate of journeyman hours to be performed under the contract, the number of apprentices proposed to be employed, and the approximate dates the apprentices would be employed. A copy of this information shall also be submitted to the awarding body, if requested by the awarding body. Within 60 days after concluding work on the contract, each contractor and subcontractor shall submit to the awarding body, if requested, and to the apprenticeship program a verified statement of the journeyman and apprentice hours performed on the contract. The information under this subdivision shall be public. The apprenticeship programs shall retain this information for 12 months.
(f) The apprenticeship program supplying apprentices to the area of the site of the public work shall ensure equal employment and affirmative action in apprenticeship for women and minorities.
(g) The ratio of work performed by apprentices to journeymen employed in a particular craft or trade on the public work may be no higher than the ratio stipulated in the apprenticeship standards under which the apprenticeship program operates if the contractor agrees to be bound by those standards. However, except as otherwise provided in this section, in no case shall the ratio be less than one hour of apprentice work for every five hours of journeyman work.
(h) This ratio of apprentice work to journeyman work shall apply during any day or portion of a day when any journeyman is employed at the jobsite and shall be computed on the basis of the hours worked during the day by journeymen so employed. Any work performed by a journeyman in excess of eight hours per day or 40 hours per week shall not be used to calculate the ratio. The contractor shall employ apprentices for the number of hours computed as above before the end of the contract or, in the case of a subcontractor, before the end of the subcontract. However, the contractor shall endeavor, to the greatest extent possible, to employ apprentices during the same time period that the journeymen in the same craft or trade are employed at the jobsite. When an hourly apprenticeship ratio is not feasible for a particular craft or trade, the Administrator of Apprenticeship, upon application of an apprenticeship program, may order a minimum ratio of not less than one apprentice for each five journeymen in a craft or trade classification.
(i) A contractor covered by this section who has agreed to be covered by an apprenticeship program’s standards upon the issuance of the approval certificate, or who has been previously approved for an apprenticeship program in the craft or trade, shall employ the number of apprentices or the ratio of apprentices to journeymen stipulated in the applicable apprenticeship standards, but in no event less than the 1-to-5 ratio required by subdivision (g).
(j) Upon proper showing by a contractor that he or she employs apprentices in a particular craft or trade in the state on all of his or her contracts on an annual average of not less than one hour of apprentice work for every five hours of labor performed by journeymen, the Administrator of Apprenticeship may grant a certificate exempting the contractor from the 1-to-5 hourly ratio, as set forth in this section for that craft or trade.
(k) An apprenticeship program has the discretion to grant to a participating contractor or contractor association a certificate, which shall be subject to the approval of the Administrator of Apprenticeship, exempting the contractor from the 1-to-5 ratio set forth in this section when it finds that any one of the following conditions is met:
(1) Unemployment for the previous three-month period in the area exceeds an average of 15 percent.
(2) The number of apprentices in training in the area exceeds a ratio of 1 to 5.
(3) There is a showing that the apprenticeable craft or trade is replacing at least one-thirtieth of its journeymen annually through apprenticeship training, either on a statewide basis or on a local basis.
(4) Assignment of an apprentice to any work performed under a public works contract would create a condition that would jeopardize his or her life or the life, safety, or property of fellow employees or the public at large, or the specific task to which the apprentice is to be assigned is of a nature that training cannot be provided by a journeyman.
(l) If an exemption is granted pursuant to subdivision (k) to an organization that represents contractors in a specific trade from the 1-to-5 ratio on a local or statewide basis, the member contractors shall not be required to submit individual applications for approval to local joint apprenticeship committees, if they are already covered by the local apprenticeship standards.
(m) (1) A contractor to whom a contract is awarded, who, in performing any of the work under the contract, employs journeymen or apprentices in any apprenticeable craft or trade shall contribute to the California Apprenticeship Council the same amount that the director determines is the prevailing amount of apprenticeship training contributions in the area of the public works site. A contractor may take as a credit for payments to the council any amounts paid by the contractor to an approved apprenticeship program that can supply apprentices to the site of the public works project. The contractor may add the amount of the contributions in computing his or her bid for the contract.
(2) At the conclusion of the 2002–03 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, the California Apprenticeship Council shall distribute training contributions received by the council under this subdivision, less the expenses of the Department of Industrial Relations for administering this subdivision, by making grants to approved apprenticeship programs for the purpose of training apprentices. The funds shall be distributed as follows:
(A) If there is an approved multiemployer apprenticeship program serving the same craft or trade and geographic area for which the training contributions were made to the council, a grant to that program shall be made.
(B) If there are two or more approved multiemployer apprenticeship programs serving the same craft or trade and county for which the training contributions were made to the council, the grant shall be divided among those programs based on the number of apprentices from that county registered in each program.
(C) All training contributions not distributed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be used to defray the future expenses of the Department of Industrial Relations for the administration and enforcement of apprenticeship standards and requirements under this code.
(3) All training contributions received pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited in the Apprenticeship Training Contribution Fund, which is hereby created in the State Treasury. Upon appropriation by the Legislature, all moneys in the Apprenticeship Training Contribution Fund shall be used for the purpose of carrying out this subdivision and to pay the expenses of the Department of Industrial Relations.
(n) The body awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract stipulations to effectuate this section. The stipulations shall fix the responsibility of compliance with this section for all apprenticeable occupations with the prime contractor.
(o) This section does not apply to contracts of general contractors or to contracts of specialty contractors not bidding for work through a general or prime contractor when the contracts of general contractors or those specialty contractors involve less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000).
(p) An awarding body that implements an approved labor compliance program in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 1771.5 may, with the approval of the director, assist in the enforcement of this section under the terms and conditions prescribed by the director.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law requires that, except as specified, not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages, determined by the Director of Industrial Relations, be paid to workers employed on public works projects. Under existing law, an apprentice employed upon public works is required to be paid the prevailing rate of per diem wages for apprentices in the trade to which he or she is registered and to be employed only at the work of the craft or trade to which he or she is registered, as specified.
This bill would require, when a contractor requests the dispatch of an apprentice to perform work on a public works project and requires compliance with certain preemployment activities as a condition of employment, as specified, that the apprentice be paid the prevailing rate for the time spent on any required preemployment activity, including travel time to and from the activity, if any, except as specified.
Because this bill would expand the application of the prevailing wage requirements, the violation of which is a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Section 1777.5 of the Labor Code, relating to public works."

(B) Each employer of an EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P shall notify the regulating entity within three days after the EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P is terminated or suspended for a disciplinary cause, the EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P resigns following notification of an impending investigation based upon evidence that would indicate the existence of a disciplinary cause, or the EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P is removed from EMT-related duties for a disciplinary cause after the completion of the employer’s investigation. The employer of an EMT-P shall provide the regulating entity with all supporting documentation at the time of notification.
(C) At the conclusion of an investigation, the employer may develop and implement, in accordance with the guidelines for disciplinary orders, temporary suspensions, and conditions of probation adopted pursuant to Section 1797.184, a disciplinary plan for the EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P.

The act authorizes an employer of an EMT-I or EMT-II to conduct investigations and take disciplinary action against an EMT-I or EMT-II who is employed by that employer for specified conduct, and authorizes the authority to, among other things, deny, suspend, or revoke any EMT-P license for the same specified conduct. Existing law requires an EMT-P’s employer to report in writing to the local EMS agency and the authority within 30 days of specified disciplinary action being taken with regard to an EMT-P.
This bill would require the authority to develop and adopt guidelines for disciplinary orders, temporary suspensions, and conditions of probation for EMT-P licenseholders. The bill would also integrate and conform the procedures for investigating misconduct of EMT-P licenseholders with those of EMT-I and EMT-II certificate holders, including requiring notification of disciplinary action with regard to an EMT-P to be given to the local EMS agency and the authority within 3 days.
Existing law authorizes the medical director of the local EMS agency to evaluate information that comes to his or her attention that appears to constitute grounds for disciplinary action against an EMT-P and to make a recommendation to the authority for further investigation or discipline. Existing law also authorizes the temporary suspension, in specified circumstances, of an EMT-P license.
This bill would require the medical director of the local EMS agency, if he or she makes a recommendation to the authority for further investigation or discipline, to notify the EMT-P’s employer within 3 days. The bill would additionally require notification of the EMT-P’s employer when there is a temporary suspension of an EMT-P’s license.","An act to amend Sections 1797.184, 1798.200, 1798.201, and 1798.202 of, and to repeal Section 1799.112 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to public health."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that the development of affordable housing is a matter of statewide concern and is not a municipal affair as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution. Therefore, Section 65915.7 of the Government Code, as proposed to be added by this act, shall apply to all cities, including charter cities.
SEC. 2.
Section 65915.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:
65915.7.

(1) Within the boundaries of the local government.
(2) In close proximity to public amenities including schools and employment centers.
(3) Located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 21155 of the Public Resources Code.
(b) The development bonus granted to the commercial developer shall mean incentives, mutually agreed upon by the developer and the jurisdiction, that may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
(1) Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum allowable intensity in the General Plan.
(2) Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum allowable floor area ratio.
(3) Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum height requirements.
(4) Up to a 20-percent reduction in minimum parking requirements.
(5) Use of a limited-use/limited-application elevator for upper floor accessibility.
(6) An exception to a zoning ordinance or other land use regulation.
(c) For the purposes of this section, the agreement for partnered housing shall be between the commercial developer and the housing developer, shall identify how the commercial developer will contribute affordable housing, and shall be approved by the city, county, or city and county.
(d) For the purposes of this section, affordable housing may be contributed by the commercial developer in one of the following manners:
(1) The commercial developer may directly build the units.
(2) The commercial developer may donate a portion of the site or property elsewhere to the affordable housing developer for use as a site for affordable housing.
(3) The commercial developer may make a cash payment to the affordable housing developer that shall be used towards the costs of constructing the affordable housing project.
(e) For the purposes of this section, subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 65915 shall apply.
(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude any additional allowances or incentives offered to developers by local governments pursuant to law or regulation.
(g) If the developer of the affordable units does not commence with construction of those units in accordance with timelines ascribed by the agreement described in subdivision (c), the local government may withhold certificates of occupancy for the commercial development under construction until the developer has completed construction of the affordable units.
(h) In order to qualify for a development bonus under this section, a commercial developer shall partner with a housing developer that provides at least 30 percent of the total units for low-income households or at least 15 percent of the total units for very low-income households.
(i) Nothing in this section shall preclude an affordable housing developer from seeking a density bonus, concessions or incentives, waivers or reductions of development standards, or parking ratios under Section 65915.
(j) A development bonus pursuant to this section shall not include a reduction or waiver of the requirements within an ordinance that requires the payment of a fee by a commercial developer for the promotion or provision of affordable housing.

(l) For purposes of this section, “partner” shall mean formation of a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, or other entity recognized by the state in which the commercial development applicant and the affordable housing developer are each partners, members, shareholders or other participants, or a contract or agreement between a commercial development applicant and affordable housing developer for the development of both the commercial and the affordable housing properties.
(m) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2022, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC. 3.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","The Planning and Zoning Law requires, when an applicant proposes a housing development within the jurisdiction of the local government, that the city, county, or city and county provide the developer with a density bonus and other incentives or concessions for the production of lower income housing units or for the donation of land within the development if the developer, among other things, agrees to construct a specified percentage of units for very low, low-, or moderate-income households or qualifying residents.
This bill, when an applicant for approval of a commercial development has entered into an agreement for partnered housing with an affordable housing developer to contribute affordable housing through a joint project or 2 separate projects encompassing affordable housing, would, until January 1, 2022, require a city, county, or city and county to grant to the commercial developer a development bonus, as specified. The bill would define the development bonus to mean incentives mutually agreed upon by the developer and the jurisdiction that may include but are not limited to, specified changes in land use requirements. This bill would also require a city or county to submit to the Department of Housing and Community Development information describing an approved commercial development bonus. By increasing the duties of local officials relating to the administration of development bonuses, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add and repeal Section 65915.7 of the Government Code, relating to housing."

(2) A peace officer is not required to review his or her body-worn camera video and audio recordings before making a report, giving an internal affairs statement, or before any criminal or civil proceeding.
(3) A peace officer involved in an incident involving a serious use of force shall not review his or her body-worn camera recording until accompanied by an assigned independent investigator or a supervisor. The separating and monitoring of the peace officer involved in a serious use of force shall be maintained during the review of the body-worn camera video and audio recordings and this review shall not occur jointly among involved employees. Once the recordings are approved, as to the validity of the body-worn camera recordings and any other relevant recordings are also approved as their validity, an officer may have a legal representative present during the review of the recordings without the independently assigned investigator or supervisor present, before the peace officer makes a report, is ordered to give an internal affairs statement, or before any criminal or civil proceeding.
(4) The policy shall be available to all peace officers in a written form.
(5) The policy shall be available to the public for viewing.
(6) The policy shall prohibit a peace officer from making a video or audio recording in a health facility or medical office when a patient may be in view of the body-worn camera or when a health care practitioner is providing care to an individual.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law requires law enforcement agencies, departments, or entities to consider specified best practices regarding the downloading and storage of body-worn camera data when establishing policies and procedures for the implementation and operation of a body-worn camera system, such as designating the person responsible for downloading the recorded data from the body-worn camera, and establishing when data should be downloaded to ensure the data is entered into the system in a timely manner and the cameras are properly maintained and ready for the next use.
This bill would require a law enforcement agency, department, or entity, if it employs peace officers and uses body-worn cameras for those officers, to develop a body-worn camera policy. The bill would require the policy to allow a peace officer to review his or her body-worn camera video and audio recordings before making a report, giving an internal affairs statement, or before any criminal or civil proceeding.
The bill would also require the policy to prohibit
a peace officer from making a video or audio recording in a health facility or medical office when a patient may be in view of the body-worn camera or when a health care practitioner is providing care to an individual.
The bill would encourage the law enforcement agency, department, or entity to include specified considerations in the policy, including the time, place, circumstances, and duration in which the body-worn camera is operational. The bill would require the policy to be available to peace officers and to the public for viewing.

The bill would also require a law enforcement agency to have an assigned independent investigator or a supervisor accompany a peace officer involved in an incident involving a serious use of force, as defined, when reviewing the peace officer’s body-worn camera recording.
The bill would provide that its provisions do not apply to a law enforcement agency, department, or entity that has developed a body-worn camera policy, as specified, before January 1, 2017.
Because this bill would impose new duties on the conduct of local law enforcement, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to add Section 832.19 to the Penal Code, relating to peace officers."

No state or local agency employing peace officers or parking enforcement employees engaged in the enforcement of this code shall use the number of arrests or citations issued by a peace officer or parking enforcement employees as the sole criterion for promotion, demotion, dismissal, or the earning of any benefit provided by the agency. Those arrests or citations, and their ultimate dispositions, may only be considered in evaluating the overall performance of a peace officer or parking enforcement employees. An evaluation may include, but shall not be limited to, criteria such as attendance, punctuality, work safety, complaints by civilians, commendations, demeanor, formal training, and professional judgment.","Existing law requires each department or agency in this state that employs peace officers to establish a procedure to investigate complaints by members of the public against the personnel of these departments or agencies, and to make a written description of the procedure available to the public. Existing law also refers to these complaints as citizens’ complaints. Existing law sets forth specified policies and procedures relating to citizens’ complaints. Among other things, existing law makes it a misdemeanor to file an allegation of misconduct against a peace officer knowing the allegation to be false. Existing law requires a law enforcement agency accepting an allegation of misconduct against a peace officer to require the complainant to read and sign a specified advisory that describes, generally, the law and procedure governing citizens’ complaints. Existing law also requires the Department of Justice to prepare and present to the Governor, on or before July 1, an annual report containing the criminal statistics of the preceding calendar year, including, among other statistics, the total number of citizen complaints alleging racial or identity profiling, as specified.
This bill would delete references to citizens’ complaints and instead refer to civilians’ complaints.","An act to amend Section 8332 of the Government Code, to amend Sections 148.6, 832.18, 13010.5, 13012, and 13012.5 of the Penal Code, and to amend Section 41603 of the Vehicle Code, relating to public safety."

SECTION 1.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Direct Access to Reproductive Health Care Act.
SEC. 2.
(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(1) For many women, reproductive health care may be the only contact they have with the health care system.
(2) According to the Guttmacher Institute, one-half of all pregnancies in the United States each year, more than three million pregnancies, are unintended. By 45 years of age, more than one-half of all women in the United States will have experienced an unintended pregnancy, and 3 in 10 will have had an abortion.
(3) The inability to access comprehensive reproductive health care in a timely manner can lead to negative health outcomes, including increased risk for unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and delayed care for critical and time-sensitive reproductive health services.
(4) Providing timely access to comprehensive reproductive health services is cost effective.
(5) California has a long history of, and commitment to, expanding access to services that aim to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, improve reproductive and sexual health outcomes, and reduce costs.
(6) Recognizing the importance of timely access to comprehensive reproductive and sexual health care services, the Legislature and the United States Congress passed measures to enable women to access care provided by an obstetrician and gynecologist without a referral. Despite these advances, there are wide variances in health benefit plans regarding referral requirements for reproductive and sexual health care services, and women across the state are obtaining these vital services from other licensed provider types, including family practice physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
(b) It is hereby the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to build on current state and federal law to increase timely, equal, and direct access to time-sensitive and comprehensive reproductive and sexual health care services for enrollees in health care service plans or insureds under health insurance policies by prohibiting health care service plans or insurers from requiring an enrollee or insured to secure a referral from a primary care provider prior to receiving in-network reproductive and sexual health care services.
SEC. 3.
Section 1367.31 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
1367.31.

(2) For the purposes of this section, “reproductive and sexual health care services” do not include the services subject to a health care service plan’s referral procedures as required by subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 1374.16.
(3) This section applies whether or not the patient is a minor.
(c) In implementing this section, a health care service plan may establish reasonable provisions governing utilization protocols for obtaining reproductive and sexual health care services, as provided for in subdivision (a), from health care providers participating in, or contracting with, the plan network, medical group, or independent practice association, provided that these provisions shall be consistent with the intent of this section and shall be those customarily applied to other health care providers, such as primary care physicians and surgeons, to whom the enrollee has direct access, and shall not be more restrictive for the provision of reproductive and sexual health care services. An enrollee shall not be required to obtain prior approval from another physician, another provider, or the health care service plan prior to obtaining direct access to reproductive and sexual health care services. A health care service plan may establish reasonable provisions governing communication with the enrollee’s primary care physician and surgeon regarding the enrollee’s condition, treatment, and any need for followup care.
(d) This section shall not apply to a health care service plan contract that does not require enrollees to obtain a referral from their primary care physician prior to seeking covered health care services from a specialist.
(e) A health care service plan shall not impose utilization protocols related to contraceptive drugs, supplies, and devices beyond the provisions outlined in Section 1367.25 of this code or Section 14132 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(f) This section shall not apply to specialized health care service plan contracts or any health care service plan that is governed by Section 14131 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
SEC. 4.
Section 10123.202 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:
10123.202.
(a) Every health insurance policy issued, amended, renewed, or delivered on or after January 1, 2017, excluding specialized health insurance policies, shall be prohibited from requiring an insured to receive a referral prior to receiving coverage or services for reproductive and sexual health care.
(b) (1) For the purposes of this section, “reproductive and sexual health care services” are all reproductive and sexual health services described in Sections 6925, 6926, 6927, and 6928 of the Family Code, or Section 121020 of the Health and Safety Code, obtained by a patient.
(2) This section applies whether or not the patient is a minor.
(c) In implementing this section, a health insurer may establish reasonable provisions governing utilization protocols for obtaining reproductive and sexual health care services, as provided for in subdivision (a), provided that these provisions shall be consistent with the intent of this section and shall be those customarily applied to other health care providers, such as primary care physicians and surgeons, to whom the insured has direct access, and shall not be more restrictive for the provision of reproductive and sexual health care services. An insured shall not be required to obtain prior approval from another physician, another provider, or the insurer prior to obtaining direct access to reproductive and sexual health care services. An insurer may establish reasonable provisions governing communication with the insured’s primary care physician and surgeon regarding the insured’s condition, treatment, and any need for followup care.
(d) This section shall not apply to a health insurance policy that does not require insureds to obtain a referral from their primary care physician prior to seeking covered health care services from a specialist.

(f) This section shall not apply to specialized health insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, short-term limited duration health insurance, CHAMPUS supplement insurance, or TRICARE supplement insurance, or to hospital indemnity, accident-only, or specified disease insurance.

No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.","Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance.
This bill would prohibit every health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, renewed, or delivered on or after January 1, 2017, with exceptions, from requiring an enrollee or insured to receive a referral in order to receive reproductive or sexual health care services, as provided. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

(a) The court shall appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, and any other expert the court may deem appropriate, to examine the defendant. In any case where the defendant or the defendant’s counsel informs the court that the defendant is not seeking a finding of mental incompetence, the court shall appoint two psychiatrists, licensed psychologists, or a combination thereof. One of the psychiatrists or licensed psychologists may be named by the defense and one may be named by the prosecution. The examining psychiatrists or licensed psychologists shall evaluate the nature of the defendant’s mental disorder, if any, the defendant’s ability or inability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner as a result of a mental disorder and, if within the scope of their licenses and appropriate to their opinions, whether or not treatment with antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate for the defendant and whether antipsychotic medication is likely to restore the defendant to mental competence. If an examining psychologist is of the opinion that antipsychotic medication may be medically appropriate for the defendant and that the defendant should be evaluated by a psychiatrist to determine if antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate, the psychologist shall inform the court of this opinion and his or her recommendation as to whether a psychiatrist should examine the defendant. The examining psychiatrists or licensed psychologists shall also address the issues of whether the defendant has capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and whether the defendant is a danger to self or others. If the defendant is examined by a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist forms an opinion as to whether or not treatment with antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate, the psychiatrist shall inform the court of his or her opinions as to the likely or potential side effects of the medication, the expected efficacy of the medication, possible alternative treatments, and whether it is medically appropriate to administer antipsychotic medication in the county jail. If it is suspected the defendant is developmentally disabled, the court shall appoint the director of the regional center for the developmentally disabled established under Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or the designee of the director, to examine the defendant. The court may order the developmentally disabled defendant to be confined for examination in a residential facility or state hospital.

(2) If the defense declines to offer any evidence in support of the allegation of mental incompetence, the prosecution may do so.
(c) The prosecution shall present its case regarding the issue of the defendant’s present mental competence.
(d) Each party may offer rebutting testimony, unless the court, for good reason in furtherance of justice, also permits other evidence in support of the original contention.
(e) When the evidence is concluded, unless the case is submitted without final argument, the prosecution shall make its final argument and the defense shall conclude with its final argument to the court or jury.
(f) In a jury trial, the court shall charge the jury, instructing them on all matters of law necessary for the rendering of a verdict. It shall be presumed that the defendant is mentally competent unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally incompetent. The verdict of the jury shall be unanimous.

(2) When making appointments pursuant to this section, the court shall appoint experts who meet the guidelines established in accordance with this subdivision or experts with equivalent experience and skills. If there is no reasonably available expert who meets the guidelines or who has equivalent experience and skills, the court shall have the discretion to appoint an expert who does not meet the guidelines.","Existing law prohibits a person from being tried or adjudged to punishment while that person is mentally incompetent.

The borrower of the downpayment assistance shall provide the lender originating the loan with a certification from the local government agency administering the infill opportunity zone, the transit village development district, or the transit-oriented development specific plan area that states that the property involved in the loan transaction is within the boundaries of either the infill opportunity zone, the transit village development district, or the transit-oriented development specific plan area.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the agency may, but is not required to, provide downpayment assistance that does not exceed 6 percent of the home sale price to first-time low-income home buyers who, as documented to the agency by a nonprofit organization that is certified and funded to provide home ownership counseling by a federally funded national nonprofit corporation, are purchasing a residence in a community revitalization area targeted by the nonprofit organization as a neighborhood in need of economic stimulation, renovation, and rehabilitation through efforts that include increased home ownership opportunities for low-income families. The agency shall not use more than six million dollars ($6,000,000) in funds made available pursuant to Section 53533 for the purposes of this paragraph.

The borrower may refinance the mortgages on the home provided that the principal and accrued interest on the junior mortgage loan securing the downpayment assistance are repaid in full. All repayments shall be made to the agency to be reallocated for the purposes of this chapter.
(B) The agency may, in its discretion, permit the downpayment assistance loan to be subordinated to refinancing if it determines that the borrower has demonstrated hardship, subordination is required to avoid foreclosure, and the new loan meets the agency’s underwriting requirements. The agency may permit subordination on those terms and conditions as it determines are reasonable.
(C) The amount of the downpayment assistance shall not be due and payable upon sale of the home if the first mortgage loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or if the first mortgage loan is, or has been, transferred to the FHA, or if the requirement is otherwise contrary to regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development governing FHA insured first mortgage loans.
(5) The agency may use up to 5 percent of the funds appropriated by the Legislature for purposes of this chapter to administer this program.

(B) Land use controls.
(C) Building codes and enforcement.

The sum of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is hereby appropriated from the General Fund to the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program for the purposes set forth in Section 51504 of the Health and Safety Code that satisfy the requirements of subdivision (c) of that section. After 48 months of availability, if the California Housing Finance Agency determines that these moneys will not be utilized for the purposes set forth in Section 51504 of the Health and Safety Code that satisfy the requirements of subdivision (c) of that section, the moneys shall be available for the general use of the California Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program.","Existing law establishes the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program, which requires the California Housing Finance Agency to, among other things, administer a program that provides downpayment assistance, including deferred-payment, low-interest, junior mortgage loans to reduce principal and interest payments, that makes financing affordable to first-time low- and moderate-income home buyers, pursuant to specified terms.
This bill would appropriate $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program for the purposes of the downpayment assistance program described above. The bill would condition the application of these funds on an additional requirement that the home for which assistance is provided be in a development project that is in a designated infill site, close to public transit, and that is located in a city, county, or city and county that reduces developer or impact fees or reduces or removes regulatory barriers to housing construction for the development project, as specified. As part of this additional requirement, the bill would require a local agency to provide verification of the local agency’s schedule of local fees, charges, and other exactions to the California Housing Finance Agency and would thereby impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make these moneys available for the general use of the California Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program if specified requirements are met.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","An act to amend Section 51504 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, and making an appropriation therefor."

The county recorder shall not refuse to record any instrument, paper, or notice that is authorized or required by statute, court order, or local ordinance that relates to the recordation of any instrument, paper, or notice that relates to real property to be recorded on the basis of its lack of legal sufficiency.
“Photographically reproducible,” for purposes of this division, means all instruments, papers, or notices that comply with standards as recommended by the American National Standards Institute or the Association for Information and Image Management for recording of records.
(b) (1) Each instrument, paper, or notice shall contain an original signature or signatures, except as otherwise provided by law, or be a certified copy of the original.
(2) A facsimile signature shall be accepted on a lien recorded by a governmental agency when that facsimile signature has been officially adopted by that agency.

982,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) Great strides have been made over the last three decades in raising awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence (DUI). Nationwide educational campaigns, extensive policy and statutory changes, and required participation in DUI education and counseling programs for offenders have substantially reduced the alcohol-related traffic fatality rate. However, the latest California DUI report issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles identifies a troubling trend in that alcohol-involved crash fatalities increased by 1.6 percent in 2011 and 7.3 percent in 2012. More needs to be done to address, in particular, the incidence of repeat DUI violators.
(b) To improve public safety and improve health outcomes, additional screening and assessment of both repeat DUI offenders and first-time offenders with extremely high blood alcohol content is necessary to determine if alcohol dependence issues exist. The use of the American Society for Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria, a widely used and nationally recognized set of guidelines to assess, place, and discharge persons with addiction and co-occurring conditions, would expand the use of data and science to address alcohol abuse, promote referrals to medically necessary treatment, when appropriate, and reduce fatalities and serious injuries on public roads.
(c) In 2007, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), at the request of the California Office of Traffic Safety, conducted an assessment of the state’s alcohol- and drug-impaired-driving countermeasures program. The NHTSA’s work resulted in identification of key issues of concern around impaired driving and produced dozens of recommendations to improve the state’s DUI countermeasures program. Among the recommendations offered in the 2007 Impaired Driving Technical Assessment of the State of California was a recommendation to enact legislation to require all defendants convicted of driving under the influence or reckless driving with alcohol or drugs be screened to determine if a defendant requires treatment for addiction and chemical dependency.
(d) California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services already require the use of the ASAM in other treatment settings. Under the federally approved Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System waiver, counties will be required to use the ASAM tool with the Drug Medi-Cal population.
SEC. 2.
Section 11837 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
11837.
(a) Pursuant to the provisions of law relating to suspension of a person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle upon conviction for driving while under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and any drug, as set forth in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 13352 of the Vehicle Code, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall restrict the driving privilege pursuant to Section 13352.5 of the Vehicle Code, if the person convicted of that offense participates for at least 18 months in a driving-under-the-influence program that is licensed pursuant to this chapter.
(b) In determining whether to refer a person, who is ordered to participate in a program pursuant to Section 668 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, in a licensed alcohol and other drug education and counseling services program pursuant to Section 23538 of the Vehicle Code, or, pursuant to Section 23542, 23548, 23552, 23556, 23562, or 23568 of the Vehicle Code, in a licensed 18-month or 30-month program, the court may consider any relevant information about the person made available pursuant to a presentence investigation, that is permitted but not required under Section 23655 of the Vehicle Code, or other screening procedure. That information shall not be furnished, however, by any person who also provides services in a privately operated, licensed program or who has any direct interest in a privately operated, licensed program. In addition, the court shall obtain from the Department of Motor Vehicles a copy of the person’s driving record to determine whether the person is eligible to participate in a licensed 18-month or 30-month program pursuant to this chapter. When preparing a presentence report for the court, the probation department may consider the suitability of placing the defendant in a treatment program that includes the administration of nonscheduled nonaddicting medications to ameliorate an alcohol or controlled substance problem. If the probation department recommends that this type of program is a suitable option for the defendant, the defendant who would like the court to consider this option shall obtain from his or her physician a prescription for the medication, and a finding that the treatment is medically suitable for the defendant, prior to consideration of this alternative by the court.
(c) (1) The court shall, as a condition of probation pursuant to Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code, refer a first offender whose concentration of alcohol in his or her blood was less than 0.20 percent, by weight, to participate for at least three months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 30 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in this chapter.
(2) Notwithstanding any other
provision of
law, in granting probation to a first offender described in this subdivision whose concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood was 0.20 percent or more, by weight, or the person refused to take a chemical test, the court shall order the person to participate, for at least nine months or longer, as ordered by the court, in a licensed program that consists of at least 60 hours of program activities, including those education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions described in this chapter.
(d) (1) The State Department of Health Care Services may specify in regulations the activities required to be provided in the treatment of participants receiving nine months of licensed program services under Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code.
(2) Any program licensed pursuant to this chapter may provide treatment services to participants receiving at least six months of licensed program services under Section 23538 or 23556 of the Vehicle Code.
(e) The court may, subject to Section 11837.2, and as a condition of probation, refer a person to a licensed program, even though the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle is restricted, suspended, or revoked. An 18-month program described in Section 23542 or 23562 of the Vehicle Code or a 30-month program described in Section 23548, 23552, or 23568 of the Vehicle Code may include treatment of family members and significant other persons related to the convicted person with the consent of those family members and others as described in this chapter, if there is no increase in the costs of the program to the convicted person.
(f) The clerk of the court shall indicate the duration of the program in which the judge has ordered the person to participate in the abstract of the record of the court that is forwarded to the department.
(g) The court shall order, as a condition of probation for the following persons, the administration of the American Society for Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria to assess alcohol dependence and to inform the development of an individual’s comprehensive treatment plan:
(1) A first-time offender whose concentration of alcohol in his or her blood was 0.16 percent or greater.
(2) A person referred to an 18-month program described in Section 23542 or 23562 of the Vehicle Code.
(3) A person referred to a 30-month program described in Section 23548, 23552, or 23568 of the Vehicle Code.
(h) The entity administering the assessment required by subdivision (g) shall advise the person subject to the assessment of all of the following:
(1) That the person should consult with his or her physician to discuss the results of the assessment, including any medically necessary services.
(2) If the person’s physician determines that substance use disorder treatment is medically necessary, that the person should be referred to a licensed residential or certified outpatient treatment program.
(3) That there are medications approved by the Federal Drug Administration that can address alcohol dependence.
(i) The goal of the assessment required by subdivision (g) is to assist persons participating in the program to recognize their chemical dependency and to assist them in their recovery.
SECTION 1.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require American Society of Addiction Medicine assessments for certain individuals who are repeat offenders of driving under the influence of alcohol or who were driving under the influence with excessive blood alcohol levels to determine if the individual needs treatment and to refer the individual for additional services, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, physician services, counseling, treatment facility services, and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol abuse.","Existing law makes it an offense to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
Existing law requires the court to impose as a condition of probation for a conviction for a first violation of driving under the influence, in a county where the board of supervisors has approved, and the State Department of Health Care Services has licensed, a driving-under-the-influence program, that the driver successfully complete the program in the driver’s county of residence or employment, as designated by the court. Existing law provides that enrollment and participation in, and completion of, an approved program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation.
This bill would require a court to impose an alcohol dependence assessment, as specified, as a condition of probation for a person in an 18-month or 30-month driving-under-the-influence program, or for a first offender who had a specified blood alcohol level. The bill would require the entity administering the assessment to advise the person, among other things, that there are medications that can address alcohol dependence, and that the person should consult his or her physician regarding the results of the assessment. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding driving under the influence.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require American Society of Addiction Medicine assessments for certain individuals who are repeat offenders of driving under the influence of alcohol or who were driving under the influence with excessive blood alcohol levels, to determine if the individual needs treatment, and to refer the individual for additional services, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, physician services, counseling, treatment facility services, and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol abuse.","An act

SEC. 14.
The Legislature finds and declares that Sections 2 and 3 of this act, which add Sections 58853 and 63906 to the Food and Agricultural Code, impose a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by these limitations and the need for protecting that interest:
In order for food and agriculture marketing order advisory boards and agricultural and seafood industry councils and commissions to hold meetings and make timely decisions, it is in the state’s interest to revise the requirements for teleconferences for these boards, councils, and commissions in order to encourage participation by directors. Many of these directors are located in remote locations in the state that are difficult for the public to access and the directors may need to participate from a nonstationary location.","Existing law establishes the California Avocado Commission within the state government, and requires the commission to establish no fewer than 3 districts and no more than 5 districts within the state, each representing approximately the same percentage of avocado production in California. Existing law requires the commission to consist of a specified number of producers who are not handlers, based on the number of districts the commission establishes, 4 handlers who are elected on a statewide basis, one public member, and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, and requires there to be 2 alternate handler members. Existing law requires a vacancy of a member position on the commission to be filled by the alternate member. Existing law authorizes certain handlers who handle a specified percentage of volume of avocados to appoint one handler member to the commission and the other handlers to nominate and elect the remaining handler members.
This bill would instead require that a vacancy of a member position be filled by a majority vote of the commission. The bill would decrease the number of handlers on the commission to 2 members and the number of alternate handler members to one member. The bill would remove the authorization for specified handlers to appoint a handler member.
Existing law requires producer members and alternate producer members, at the time of the election, to have a financial interest in producing, or causing to be produced, avocados for market within the district in which the producer stands for election. Existing law prohibits a producer who chooses to stand for election in a particular district from standing for election in any other district for a period of 4 years from the date of his or her most recent election to the commission.
This bill would delete this prohibition on the producer. The bill would specify that, for these purposes, a producer or grower would not include a person who has an average annual production of less than 10,000 pounds of avocados in the 3 preceding marketing years. The bill would require that, to be nominated and elected to the commission, a handler or alternate handler handle no less than 1% of the total industry volume of avocados in the preceding marketing year.
Existing law provides that a quorum of the commission is 11 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 5 districts, and is 10 voting members if the commission consists of 4 districts. Existing law authorizes the commission to recommend to the secretary that the operations of the commission be suspended upon a specified finding of 11 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 5 districts, or 10 voting members if the commission consists of 4 districts.
This bill would instead provide that a quorum of the commission is 9 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 4 districts, and is 10 voting members if the commission consists of 5 districts. The bill would make a similar change to the authorization of the commission to recommend suspension of its operations.
Existing law requires the secretary to establish a list of producers in each district and, in establishing the lists, requires handlers to file, within 90 days following receipt of a written request by the secretary, certain information about each producer from whom the handler purchased or handled avocados.
This bill would require handlers to file the information, including the grove location of each producer instead of district numbers, within 60 days.
Existing law, the California Marketing Act of 1937, authorizes the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to issue marketing orders which regulate producer marketing, the processing, distributing, or handling in any manner of any commodity by any and all persons that are engaged in the producer marketing, processing, distributing, or handling of the commodity within this state. The act requires that any marketing order issued pursuant to the act provide for the establishment of an advisory board to assist the secretary in the administration of any marketing order, as prescribed. Existing law also establishes various commissions and councils to advance the interests of the state’s agricultural and seafood industries to provide benefit to the entire industry and all the people of this state.
Existing law, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a state body, as defined, be open and public and all persons be permitted to attend any meeting of a state body. Existing law requires a state body subject to the open meeting requirements of the act that conducts a meeting or proceeding by teleconference to post agendas at all teleconference locations and requires each teleconference location to be accessible to the public. The act also requires the state body to provide an opportunity for members of the public to address the state body directly from any teleconference location.
This bill would require that, for a meeting held by teleconference by a marketing order advisory board or an agricultural or seafood industry council or commission, a member of the advisory board, council, or commission participating by teleconference be listed in the minutes of the meeting and would require the member to provide notice of his or her participation by teleconference at least 24 hours before the meeting. The bill would require the advisory board, council, or commission to designate a primary physical meeting location and would require at least one member of the advisory board, council, or commission to be in attendance at the primary physical meeting location. The bill would require the teleconference phone number and other specified information to be included in the agenda and would require the agenda to be open to the public. The bill would require the advisory board, council, or commission to adopt certain teleconferencing guidelines prior to holding a meeting by teleconference.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","An act to amend Sections 67039, 67051, 67052, 67052.3, 67053, 67054, 67059, 67081, and 67132 of, to add Sections 58853 and 63906 to, and to repeal Section 67051.1 of, the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to food and agriculture."

1429.5.
The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement shall establish a biennial in-person sexual violence and harassment prevention training requirement for employees and employers covered by this part by January 1, 2019. To assist in developing these standards, the director shall convene an advisory committee to recommend requirements for a sexual harassment prevention training program. The advisory committee shall be composed of representatives of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and shall also include representatives from a recognized or certified collective bargaining agent that represents janitorial workers, employers, labor-management groups in the janitorial industry, sexual assault victims advocacy groups, and other related subject matter experts.

Existing law establishes within the department the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, which is vested with the general duty of enforcing labor laws, including those relating to wage claims and employer retaliation.
This bill would require every employer subject to its provisions to keep accurate records of specific information regarding employees for 3 years. The bill would require the division to enforce its provisions and would authorize the Labor Commissioner, who is the chief of the division, to adopt any regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the bill.
The bill would require every employer, effective July 1, 2018, to register annually with the Labor Commissioner in accordance with prescribed procedures. The bill would prohibit an employer from conducting any business without registration as required by the bill and would authorize the commissioner to revoke a registration under certain circumstances. The bill would set application and renewal fees for registration.
The bill would require an employer to include specific information in the registration application. The bill would prohibit the division from granting registration under specific circumstances. The bill would require the commissioner to maintain on the department’s Internet Web site a public database of registered property service employers.
The bill would require the division, by January 1, 2019, to establish a biennial in-person sexual violence and harassment prevention training requirement for employees and employers with the assistance of a prescribed advisory committee to be convened by the director. The bill would require employers, as of July 1, 2018, and until the division establishes that training requirement, to provide employees with a pamphlet of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing on sexual harassment.
The bill would establish civil fines for specific violations of its provisions and vest in the commission the exclusive authority to enforce the civil fine provisions. The bill would require the deposit of registration fees and civil fines in the Labor Enforcement and Compliance Fund and would direct that the moneys in the fund from those fees and fines be used only for the reasonable costs of administering the registration of janitorial contractors and the costs and obligations associated with the administration and enforcement of the bill by the division.","An act to add Part 4.2 (commencing with Section 1420) to Division 2 of the Labor Code, relating to employment."
985,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) (1) Water and energy resources are inextricably connected. This relationship is known as the water-energy nexus.
(2) The energy used to drive California’s water system, including, but not limited to, the fuels used to power groundwater pumps, transportation, treatment and disposal systems for water and wastewater, heating and cooling of water in buildings and other facilities, the delivery of water, and end uses, accounts for nearly 20 percent of the total electricity usage and 30 percent of nonpower-related natural gas consumed, and there are known gaps in quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy use.
(3) Consequently, saving water saves energy and vice versa.
(4) Because the production of energy often results in the emissions of greenhouse gases, there is substantial potential for emission reductions in the water system.
(b) While energy use has historically been a fundamental element in the planning and development of California’s water supply systems, there are new opportunities for improving this linkage to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions. New projects that best serve water and energy investments can maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
SEC. 2.
Section 39719 of the
Health and Safety Code
is amended to read:
39719.
(a)The Legislature shall appropriate the annual proceeds of the fund for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this state in accordance with the requirements of Section 39712.
(b)To carry out a portion of the requirements of subdivision (a), annual proceeds are continuously appropriated for the following:
(1)Beginning in the 2015–16 fiscal year, and notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, 35 percent of annual proceeds are continuously appropriated, without regard to fiscal years, for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs as following:
(A)Ten percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Transportation Agency for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program created by Part 2 (commencing with Section 75220) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code.
(B)Five percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program created by Part 3 (commencing with Section 75230) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code. Funds shall be allocated by the Controller, according to requirements of the program, and pursuant to the distribution formula in subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 99312 of, and Sections 99313 and 99314 of, the Public Utilities Code.
(C)Twenty percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program created by Part 1 (commencing with Section 75200) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code. Of the amount appropriated in this subparagraph, no less than 10 percent of the annual proceeds, shall be expended for affordable housing, consistent with the provisions of that program.
(2)Beginning in the 2015–16 fiscal year, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, 25 percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is hereby continuously appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for the following components of the initial operating segment and Phase I Blended System as described in the 2012 business plan adopted pursuant to Section 185033 of the Public Utilities Code:
(A)Acquisition and construction costs of the project.
(B)Environmental review and design costs of the project.
(C)Other capital costs of the project.
(D)Repayment of any loans made to the authority to fund the project.
(3)Beginning in the 2017–18 fiscal year, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, the sum of two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) annually is hereby continuously appropriated from the fund to the State Water Resources Control Board to develop and implement the grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Section 189.7 of the Water Code.
(c)In determining the amount of annual proceeds of the fund for purposes of the calculation in subdivision (b), the funds subject to Section 39719.1 shall not be included.

SEC. 2.
Section 189.7 is added to the Water Code, to read:
189.7.
(a) The board, in coordination with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, and the department, shall develop and implement a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions.
(b) Project categories eligible for funding under the program include, but need not be limited to, the following:
(1) Local water projects, including, but not limited to, water recycling, stormwater capture and reuse, groundwater cleanup, seawater and brackish water desalination, and water conservation.
(2) Precision or water efficient irrigation and control technologies.
(3) Clean energy generation by water and wastewater treatment plants.
(4) Replacement of existing water pumps with more energy-efficient water pumps.
(5) Leak detection in water distribution pipelines and associated repairs.
(6) Water appliance efficiency.
(c) In order to be eligible for funding under the program, projects shall result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions, including, but not limited to, the emissions associated with pumping or transporting water.
(d) In awarding grants or low-interest loans, the board shall consider whether the proposed project helps achieve the state policy established in Section 85021 by reducing reliance on the Delta in meeting California’s future water supply needs.
(e) Any public moneys made available for the program to private water companies regulated by the Public Utilities Commission shall be used for the benefit of the ratepayers or the public, and not the investors of the companies, and shall be subject to oversight by the Public Utilities Commission.
(f) The board may adopt guidelines it determines are necessary to implement this section. A guideline adopted pursuant to this subdivision is not subject to the rulemaking requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","Existing law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases.
Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water use and supply.
The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.
This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board, in coordination with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources, to develop and implement a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions.
The bill would continuously appropriate $200,000,000 annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Water Resources Control Board to develop and implement the grant and low-interest loan program.","An act

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, is intended to reduce investigation time and facilitate efficient communication between law enforcement personnel and electronic communication service providers that provide service to the general public and that have received requests from law enforcement personnel for electronic communication and electronic communication information subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code). It shall not be construed to apply to a person or entity solely on the basis that the person or entity is a subscriber to an electronic communication service or a customer of an electronic communication service provider.
SEC. 2.
Section 1524.4 is added to the Penal Code, to read:
1524.4.
(a) This section applies to a service provider that is subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546)) and that operates in California. This section does not apply to a service provider that does not offer services to the general public.
(b) (1) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (2).
(2) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall ensure, at a minimum, that its law enforcement contact process meets all of the following criteria:
(A) Provides a specific contact mechanism for law enforcement personnel.
(B) Provides continual availability of the law enforcement contact process.
(C) Provides a method to provide status updates to a requesting law enforcement agency on a request for assistance.
(3) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall, by July 1, 2017, file a statement with the Attorney General describing the law enforcement contact process maintained pursuant to paragraph (1). If a service provider makes a material change to its law enforcement contact process, the service provider shall, as soon as practicable, file a statement with the Attorney General describing its new law enforcement contact process.
(c) The Attorney General shall consolidate the statements received pursuant to this section into one discrete record and regularly make that record available to local law enforcement agencies.
(d) The exclusive remedy for a violation of this section shall be an action brought by the Attorney General for injunctive relief. Nothing in this section shall limit remedies available for a violation of any other state or federal law.
(e) A statement filed or distributed pursuant to this section is confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to any state law, including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to protect the internal processes of private businesses from unnecessary intrusion and facilitate contact between law enforcement and private businesses regarding access to information that will protect public health and safety, it is necessary to limit access to statements filed by service providers that describe the service providers’ law enforcement contact processes.
SEC. 4.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
By facilitating contact between law enforcement and service providers regarding access to information that will protect public health and safety and by appropriately limiting access to internal business processes, this bill furthers the purpose of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.
SEC. 5.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.","Existing law authorizes a court or magistrate to issue a warrant for the search of a place and the seizure of property or things identified in the warrant if there is probable cause to believe that specified grounds exist.
This bill would require service providers to maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets specified criteria and, by July 1, 2017, file a statement with the Attorney General describing that process. The bill would require a service provider to file a statement with the Attorney General describing any material change to its process as soon as practicable after making that change. The bill would require the Attorney General to consolidate the statements received pursuant to these provisions in one discrete record and regularly make that record available to law enforcement agencies. The bill would make the statements confidential and prohibit their disclosure pursuant to any state law. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies to maintain confidential records, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to add Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, relating to law enforcement."

Existing law, the California State Safe Harbor Agreement Program Act, establishes a program to encourage landowners to manage their lands voluntarily, by means of state safe harbor agreements approved by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to benefit endangered, threatened, or candidate species without being subject to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their conservation efforts. The act authorizes the department to authorize specified acts that are otherwise prohibited pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act by entering into a safe harbor agreement. Under existing law, the act remains in effect until January 1, 2020.

Existing law prohibits a commission member or an interested person, as defined, from conducting an ex parte communication unless the commission member fully discloses and makes public that communication within 7 days after the communication or, if the communication occurs within 7 days of the next commission hearing, to the commission on the record of the proceeding at that hearing.
This bill would require a commission member to fully disclose in writing 24 hours before a commission hearing any ex parte communication conducted within 7 days of the commission hearing relating to a matter that will be discussed at the hearing, and would prohibit a commission member or an interested person from conducting such an ex parte communication within 24 hours before the commission hearing.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 provides for the regulation of the lobbying industry, including defining the term “lobbyist” and regulating the conduct of lobbyists. Among its provisions, the act prohibits lobbyists from engaging in certain activities, including accepting or agreeing to accept any payment in any way contingent upon the defeat, enactment, or outcome of any proposed legislative or administrative action. Under the act, a lobbyist is, among others, an individual whose principal duties as an employee are to communicate with, among others, any agency official for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action. For these purposes, “administrative action” is defined as the proposal, drafting, development, consideration, amendment, enactment, or defeat by a state agency of any rule, regulation, or other action in any ratemaking or quasi-legislative proceeding and “agency official” is defined as any member, officer, employee, or consultant of any state agency who participates in any administrative action in other than a ministerial capacity.
This bill would revise the definition of “administrative action” to include, with regard to proceedings before the California Coastal Commission, specified actions relating to the review, approval, and appeal of certain permit actions and coastal plans and programs. The bill would, however, exclude from these provisions relating to lobbyists an employee of a local government agency seeking, within the scope of his or her employment, to influence quasi-judicial decisions of the commission. The bill would also, for purposes of
a quasi-judicial matter
those matters
before the California Coastal Commission, limit the definition of “agency official” to a member of the commission.
Existing law makes a knowing and willful violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 a misdemeanor and subjects offenders to criminal penalties.
This bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding those crimes.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes with a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","An act to amend Sections 82002, 82039, and 86300 of the Government Code, and to amend Sections 30324 and 30325 of the Public Resources Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."

SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to increase enrollment and graduation rates among students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session (Firebaugh, Ch. 814) by requiring the designation of Dream Resource Liaisons and encouraging the creation of Dream Resource Centers at public institutions of higher education.
(b) It is estimated that each year approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools, and while California has been a leader in enacting innovative and bold laws to provide opportunities for undocumented youth to attain higher education, only 20 percent of these students attend college. Many undocumented youth and their families are unaware of recent policy changes, such as the enactment of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session, the California Dream Act of 2011, and the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that make college graduation more attainable. Currently, the majority of college campuses do not have a centralized location that provides specialized support services and resources for students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session.
(c) The creation of Dream Resource Centers would save staff time and resources by streamlining all available financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting the requirements of Assembly Bill 540 of the 2001–02 Regular Session. These Dream Resource Centers would seek to empower and create a safe and welcoming environment for those students. These centers would increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates among this population.
(d) A number of college campuses have acknowledged the needs and challenges of these students and have created Dream Resource Centers. These include: the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Davis; the California State University, Los Angeles; the California State University, Fullerton; and the California State University, Northridge. These centers provide, among other things, informational workshops, legal clinics, information on programs available to undocumented immigrants, and peer mentoring and support services to increase awareness of existing programs and available resources, enhance professional development, and increase employment opportunities.

(b) (1) Each campus of the California Community Colleges shall ensure that it has a staff person designated as a Dream Resource Liaison who is knowledgeable in available financial aid, services, and academic opportunities for all students meeting the requirements set forth in Section 68130.5, including undocumented students. The Legislature encourages each of these campuses to place this designated staff person in the campus’ extended opportunity programs and services office or financial aid office.

(3) The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each of its campuses. That staff person should be knowledgeable in available financial aid, services, and academic opportunities for all students meeting the requirements set forth in Section 68130.5, including undocumented students. The Legislature encourages each of these campuses to place this designated staff person in the campus’ educational opportunity programs office or financial aid office.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(1) Existing law establishes the segments of the public postsecondary education system in the state, including the University of California administered by the Regents of the University of California, the California State University administered by the Trustees of the California State University, and the California Community Colleges administered by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges.
Existing law provides that a student, other than a nonimmigrant alien, as defined, who has attended high school in California for 3 or more years, who has graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalent thereof, who has registered at or attends an accredited institution of higher education in California not earlier than the fall semester or quarter of the 2001–02 academic year, and who, if he or she is an alien without lawful immigration status, has filed an affidavit, as specified, is exempt from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges and the California State University.
This bill would, commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, require the California Community Colleges and the California State University, and would request the University of California to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each of their respective campuses, as specified, to assist students meeting specified requirements, including undocumented students, by streamlining access to all available financial aid and academic opportunities for those students. By requiring community colleges to designate a Dream Resource Liaison, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would encourage those institutions to establish Dream Resource Centers, and would authorize those centers to provide specified support services.
This bill would authorize the trustees, the board of governors, and the regents to seek and accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or donation whenever the gift and the terms and conditions thereof will aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers for their respective systems.
This bill would make these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2022, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2023.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

(2) A statement prepared pursuant to this subdivision shall be posted on the Internet Web site of the elections official, and may be included in a voter's pamphlet that is electronically distributed by the elections official pursuant to Section 13300.7, but shall not be included in a voter's pamphlet that is printed and mailed to voters pursuant to subdivision (b).
(3) A statement that is printed in the voter's pamphlet and mailed to voters pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be included with the statement that is prepared and electronically distributed pursuant to this subdivision.

The local agency may require each candidate filing a statement to pay in advance to the local agency his or her estimated pro rata share as a condition of having his or her statement included in the voter’s pamphlet or electronically distributed. In the event the estimated payment is required, the receipt for the payment shall include a written notice that the estimate is just an approximation of the actual cost that varies from one election to another election and may be significantly more or less than the estimate, depending on the actual number of candidates filing statements. Accordingly, the local agency is not bound by the estimate and may, on a pro rata basis, bill the candidate for additional actual expense or refund any excess paid depending on the final actual cost. In the event of underpayment, the local agency may require the candidate to pay the balance of the cost incurred. In the event of overpayment, the local agency that, or the elections official who, collected the estimated cost shall prorate the excess amount among the candidates and refund the excess amount paid within 30 days of the election.

Existing law requires each voter’s pamphlet to contain a notice in the heading of the first page of that pamphlet in heavy-faced gothic type that, among other things, each candidate’s statement in the pamphlet is volunteered by the candidate. Existing law requires an elections official to provide a Spanish translation to those candidates who wish to have one.
Existing law authorizes a county or city elections official to establish procedures designed to permit a voter to opt out of receiving his or her voter’s pamphlet and other related materials by mail, and instead obtain them electronically via email or by accessing them on the county’s or city’s Internet Web site, provided specified conditions are met.
This bill would authorize the governing body of a local agency to permit a candidate for nonpartisan elective office in the local agency to prepare a written statement for electronic distribution if the elections official who is conducting the election permits electronic distribution of a candidate’s statement. This bill would require the statement to be posted on the Internet Web site of the elections official, permit the statement to be included in a voter’s pamphlet that is electronically distributed, and prohibit the statement from being included in a voter’s pamphlet that is printed and mailed to voters. This bill would require the elections official to provide a Spanish translation to those candidates who wish to have one.

19607.
(a) Notwithstanding Sections 19605.8 and 19605.9, when satellite wagering is conducted on thoroughbred races at associations or fairs in the central or southern zone, an amount not to exceed 2 percent of the total amount handled by all of those satellite wagering facilities shall be deducted from the funds otherwise allocated for distribution as commissions, purses, and owners’ premiums and instead distributed to an organization formed and operated by one licensed association from each facility in the central and southern zones at which a thoroughbred or fair racing meeting is conducted, and the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, for use in accordance with Section 19607.1.
(b) A vote of the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen shall constitute 50 percent of all voting interests on the board of the organization formed and operated to administer the fund. The other 50 percent of all voting interests shall be allocated equally among the other members of the organization. Any use of funds by the organization shall be approved by the affirmative vote of both (1) the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, and (2) at least two of the licensed thoroughbred racing associations that are part of the organization formed pursuant to this section, provided, however, that, if there are only two licensed thoroughbred racing associations that are part of the organization formed pursuant to this section, the vote of at least one of those two licensed thoroughbred racing associations shall be sufficient.
SEC. 2.
Section 19607.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
19607.1.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 19535, the funds distributed to the organization formed pursuant to Section 19607 shall be used to pay the expenses of the organization and compensate the provider of a board-approved auxiliary facility for offsite stabling and training of thoroughbred horses in the central or southern zone. The organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program shall submit its proposed financial and operational plans for the upcoming calendar year to the board for review no later than November 1 of the preceding year. Neither the organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program nor any of the entities forming and operating the organization, except an entity operating the auxiliary offsite stabling facility where the injury occurred, shall be liable for any injury to any jockey, exercise person, owner, trainer, or any employee or agent thereof, or any horse occurring at any offsite stabling facility.
(b) The funds shall also be used to cover all or part of the cost of vanning thoroughbred horses from a board-approved auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility to start in a thoroughbred race at a thoroughbred or fair racing meeting in the central or southern zone. The organization shall determine the extent of and manner in which compensation will be paid for thoroughbred horses that are vanned from the auxiliary facility to the track conducting the thoroughbred or fair racing meeting, but the vanning shall be made available on a consistent and uniform basis for all thoroughbred and fair racing meetings in a given year. Neither the organization administering the offsite stabling and vanning program nor any of the entities that form and operate the organization, except an entity actually engaged in vanning horses, is liable for any injury occurring to any individual or horse during vanning from an offsite stabling facility.
(c) The auxiliary offsite stabling facilities and amenities provided for offsite stabling and training purposes shall be substantially equivalent in character to those provided by the thoroughbred racing association or fair conducting the racing meeting.
(d) In order to ensure the long-term availability of facilities for offsite stabling and training, the organization may enter into multiyear contracts for auxiliary facilities in either the central or southern zone. The organization shall submit to the board for its approval multiyear contracts it enters into with providers of auxiliary facilities for the offsite stabling and training. Contracts not disapproved by the board within 60 days of submittal to the board shall be deemed to have been approved by the board. Once a multiyear contract has been approved by the board, it shall be considered to have been approved for its duration.
(e) At the request of the board, the organization shall submit a report detailing all of its receipts and expenditures over the prior two fiscal years and, upon request of any party within the organization, those receipts and expenditures shall be audited by an independent third party selected by the board at the expense of the organization.
(f) In addition to the uses of funds described in subdivisions (a) and (b), the organization may use those funds to do both of the following:
(1) Maintain a reserve fund of up to 10 percent of the total estimated annual vanning and auxiliary offsite stabling costs. In addition to the reserve fund, if the funds generated for the auxiliary offsite stabling facilities and vanning are insufficient to fully cover the expenses incurred, the organization may, in the future, accumulate sufficient funds to fully cover those expenses.
(2) Pay back commissions, purses, and owners’ premiums to the extent the deductions made pursuant to Section 19607 exceed in any year the amount of funds necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization.
(g) The amount initially deducted and distributed to the organization shall be 2 percent of the total amount handled by satellite wagering facilities authorized under this article in the central or southern zone on thoroughbred racing, but that allocation may be adjusted by the board, in its discretion. However, the adjusted amount may not exceed 2 percent of the total amount handled by satellite wagering facilities.
(h) The board shall reserve the right to adjudicate any disputes that arise regarding costs or other matters relating to the furnishing of offsite stabling or vanning. Notwithstanding any other law, the board shall maintain all powers necessary and proper to ensure that offsite stabling and vanning, as provided for in this chapter, is conducted in a manner that protects the public and serves the best interests of horse racing.","(1) The Horse Racing Law requires, when satellite wagering is conducted on thoroughbred races at associations or fairs in the northern, central, or southern zone, that an amount not to exceed 1.25% of the total amount handled by all of those satellite wagering facilities be deducted from the funds otherwise allocated for distribution as commissions, purses, and owners’ premiums and instead be distributed to an organization formed and operated by thoroughbred racing associations, fairs conducting thoroughbred racing, and the organization representing thoroughbred horsemen and horsewomen, to administer a fund to provide reimbursement for offsite stabling at California Horse Racing Board-approved auxiliary training facilities for additional stalls beyond the number of usable stalls the association or fair is required to make available and maintain, and for the vanning of starters from these additional stalls on racing days for thoroughbred horses.
This bill would increase the amount that is required to be deducted to an amount not to exceed 2% in the northern, central, and southern zones, and would provide that this amount in the northern zone, if adjusted by the board, may be a different percentage of the handle for different associations and fairs, but only if all the associations and fairs agree to the differing percentages. The bill would establish an auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and vanning program for thoroughbred races in the northern, central, and southern zones. The bill would revise and recast the provisions governing the organization formed and operated to administer the fund to include, among other things, a 50-50 percentage allocation of specified voting interests on the board of the organization, the use of funds to pay the organization’s eral, or southern zone from a board-approved auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and would authorize the organization to enter into multiyear contracts for auxiliary facilities in the northern, central, or southern zone subject to specified conditions. The bill would authorize the organization to use the funds to pay back commissions, purses, and owners’ premiums to the extent that the deductions made exceed in any year the amount of the funds necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization. The bill would also authorize a thoroughbred racing association or fair in the northern zone to opt out of the auxiliary offsite stabling and training facility and vanning program, as specified. The bill would provide that the board shall reserve the right to adjudicate any disputes that arise regarding costs, or other matters, relating to the furnishing of offsite stabling or vanning, as specified.
(2) By expanding the provisions of the Horse Racing Law, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would create new crimes and would thereby impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","An act to amend Sections 19607, 19607.1, 19607.2, and 19607.3 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to horse racing, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately."

998,"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) facilitates the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of the state through identification of significant effects on the environment caused by a proposed project, consideration of alternatives, and implementation of feasible mitigation measures to reduce those effects.
(2) The act is premised on transparency in decisionmaking through public dissemination of information about a proposed project’s effect on the environment.
(3) The act empowers the public to challenge a project in court for failure to fully comply with the act’s exhaustive disclosure and mitigation requirements.
(4) Various entities are increasingly using litigation pursuant to the act for competitive purposes to either frustrate a competitor’s project or to extract concessions from a project proponent.
(5) Despite the focus on transparency and public disclosure in the decisionmaking process, shadow groups funded by unknown backers often threaten and bring litigation challenging proposed projects without being required to disclose who is funding the litigation or what financial interests those entities have related to the proposed project.
(6) Project opponents sometimes strategically use litigation to delay a project past its point of economic viability, thereby using litigation to stop projects that could not otherwise be stopped during the decisionmaking process.
(7) California Rules of Court require the disclosure of entities that fund the preparation and submission of amicus briefs to the court.
(8) The state and public have a compelling interest in the disclosure of the identities of entities that fund litigation under the act so they can better understand the identities of those organizations participating in the public decisionmaking process, determine whether the petitioner or plaintiff may be suing for competitive or other nonenvironmental purposes, and protect scarce judicial resources by deterring entities from using lawsuits for competitive or other nonenvironmental purposes.
(9) The courts have a compelling interest in disclosure to determine whether the plaintiff or petitioner is seeking to advance environmental, nonenvironmental, or a mix of environmental and nonenvironmental interests in filing an action pursuant to the act.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to require plaintiffs and petitioners bringing an action pursuant to the act to disclose those persons or entities who make contributions to fund the preparation of the petition and subsequent actions or proceedings and any financial interests they may have related to the proposed project.
SEC. 2.
Section 21175 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
21175.
(a) In an action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul any act or decision of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division, the plaintiff or petitioner shall include an affidavit identifying every person or entity who made a monetary contribution of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, or committed to contribute one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, for the preparation of the petition and subsequent action or proceeding.
(b) The plaintiff or petitioner shall have a continuing obligation throughout the course of the proceeding to identify any person or entity that has made a single or multiple contributions or commitments, the sum of which is $1,000 or more, and that were intended to fund the action or proceeding.
(c) The disclosures required pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) shall also include the identity of any pecuniary or business interest that the person or entity has related to the proposed project.
(d) A plaintiff or petitioner may request the court’s permission to withhold the public disclosure of a contributor. The court may grant the request if it finds that the public interest in keeping that information confidential clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
(e) A court may, upon its own motion or the motion of any party, take any action necessary to compel compliance with the requirements of this section, up to and including dismissal of the action or proceeding.
(f) An individual contributing funds to file an action or proceeding pursuant to this division in his or her individual capacity, and not as a representative for an organization or association, has the right to limit disclosure of his or her personal information to an in-camera review by the court.
(g) The information disclosed pursuant to this section may be used to enable a court to determine whether the financial burden of private enforcement supports the award of attorneys’ fees in actions or proceedings brought to enforce this division.
SECTION 1.
Section 21001.1 of the
Public Resources Code
is amended to read:
21001.1.
The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that projects to be carried out by public agencies be subject to the same level of review and consideration under this division as that required of private projects required to be approved by public agencies.","The California Environmental Quality Act requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment, or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect.
Existing law declares the policy of the state that a project to be carried out by a public agency be subject to the same level of review and consideration under the act as that required of private projects required to be approved by public agencies.
The act authorizes specified entities to file and maintain with a court an action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul an act of a public agency on grounds of noncompliance with the requirements of the act.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions.
This bill would require a plaintiff or petitioner, in an action brought pursuant to the act, to disclose the identity of a person or entity that contributes in excess of $1,000, as specified, toward the plaintiff’s or petitioner’s costs of the action. The bill also would require the plaintiff or petitioner to identify any pecuniary or business interest related to the project or issues involved in the action of any person or entity that contributes in excess of $1,000 to the costs of the action, as specified. The bill would provide that a failure to comply with these requirements may be grounds for dismissal of the action by the court.","An act to
amend Section 21001.1 of
