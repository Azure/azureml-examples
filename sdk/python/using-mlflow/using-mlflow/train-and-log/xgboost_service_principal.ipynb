    "# Training and tracking an XGBoost classifier with MLflow using Service Principal Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use MLflow for tracking experiment using MLflow in Azure ML using a Service Principal to authenticate against Azure. Authentication is automatically handled for you when you are running inside an Azure ML compute (Compute Instances, Compute Clusters). However, if you are using any other type of compute (like Azure Databricks, your laptop, etc) then you will have to provide credentials to be able to access Azure ML Services. By default, the `azureml-mlflow` plug-in uses Interactive Authentication. However, they may be cases where you are not able to use interactivity - for instance when you are running inside of a job or unattended system). On those cases, you can use a Service Principal to authenticate against the services. On this example, we will walk you through the steps to train a model using MLflow connected to Azure ML using a Service Principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). This database contains 76 attributes, but we will be using a subset of 14 of them. The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. In this example we will concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0)."
