    "# Use OpenAI SDK with Llama2 in Azure AI and Azure ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `openai` SDK to consume Llama2 deployments in Azure AI and Azure ML. The Llama2 family of models in Azure AI and Azure ML offers an API compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It allows customers and users to transition seamlessly from OpenAI models to Mistral LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API can be directly used with OpenAI's client libraries or third-party tools, like LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows how to make this transition using the OpenAI Python Library. Notice that Llama2 supports both text completions and chat completions API."

    "\n",
    "* Register for a valid Azure account with subscription \n",
    "* Make sure you have access to [Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio?tabs=home)\n",
    "* Create a project and resource group\n",
    "* Select Llama models from Model catalog. This example assumes you are deploying `LLama-2-70b-chat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Notice that some models may not be available in all the regions in Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning. On those cases, you can create a workspace or project in the region where the models are available and then consume it with a connection from a different one. To learn more about using connections see [Consume models with connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deployments-connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy with \"Pay-as-you-go\"\n",

    "Once deployed successfully, you should be assigned for an API endpoint and a security key for inference. \n",

    "For more information, you should consult Azure's official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-llama) for model deployment and inference.\n",
