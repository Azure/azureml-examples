    "Before we start building with Azure Meta-Llama-3 APIs, there are certain steps we need to take to deploy the models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Register for a valid Azure account with subscription \n",
    "* Make sure you have access to [Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio?tabs=home)\n",
    "* Create a project and resource group\n",
    "* Select Meta Llama models from Model catalog. This example assumes you are deploying `Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Notice that some models may not be available in all the regions in Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning. On those cases, you can create a workspace or project in the region where the models are available and then consume it with a connection from a different one. To learn more about using connections see [Consume models with connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deployments-connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy with \"Pay-as-you-go\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once deployed successfully, you should be assigned for an API endpoint and a security key for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, you should consult Azure's official documentation [here](https://aka.ms/meta-llama-3-azure-ai-studio-docs) for model deployment and inference."
