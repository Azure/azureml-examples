    "Fine-tuning is a powerful process for utilizing TimeGEN more effectively. Foundation models such as TimeGEN are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, capturing wide-ranging features and patterns. These models can then be specialized for specific contexts or domains. With fine-tuning, the model's parameters are refined to forecast a new task, allowing it to tailor its vast pre-existing knowledge towards the requirements of the new data. Fine-tuning thus serves as a crucial bridge, linking TimeGEN's broad capabilities to your tasks specificities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the process of fine-tuning consists of performing a certain number of training iterations on your input data minimizing the forecasting error. The forecasts will then be produced with the updated model. To control the number of iterations, use the `finetune_steps` argument of the `forecast` method.\n",
