TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained on a 1.2 Tesla open MR scanner. COMPARISON: A previous MR scan of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY was available for review. FINDINGS: No fractures, lytic, or blastic disease is identified. The conus is normal in signal and ends at the level of the L1-2 interspace. The thecal sac is mildly anomalous as it ends at approximately the L5 level with the more distal roots coursing through intraspinal fat. No abnormal intradural filling defects are demonstrated. At L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4, the discs are preserved. The canal and foramen are clear. At L4-5, the disc is abnormal in signal, bulges slightly, and demonstrates a focal projection into the midline and right side of the ventral epidural space consistent with a herniation. The herniation extends slightly inferior from the actual level of the interspace in the ventral epidural space. A very subtle degenerative retrolisthesis of L4 posteriorly on L5 accompanies these changes. The configuration of the facets plus the bulge and herniation cause a mild to moderate bilateral lateral recess stenosis of the canal through which both L5 roots traverse. The herniation causes minimal if any defect on the thecal sac due to the configuration of the thecal sac with a relatively ""early termination"". The foramen are clear. At L5-S1, a focal projection of the disc in the midline extending to the right is consistent with a herniation and is compressing the right S1 nerve root in the lateral recess. The foramen are clear. ----- Page Break ----- ------------------------- IMPRESSION: No change from the prior examination. Herniations at L4-5 and L5-S1 are present.

Status post motor vehicle collision in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: There is apparently a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which corresponds to a lumbarized S1 vertebra, with a well-formed S1-S2 disc space. This was determined in conjunction with the thoracic spine study performed on the same date. Accordingly, there are 6 lumbar type vertebral bodies, and the conus medullaris is situated at L1-L2. Sagittal images demonstrate mild accentuation of the normal lumbar lordosis. Evaluation of vertebral configuration demonstrates mild anterior wedging of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies, which may represent normal anatomic variation or possibly mild chronic compression deformities. The remainder of the lumbar vertebrae, as well as the lumbarized S1 vertebra, maintain normal height. Vertebral marrow signal is normal. There is no evidence of marrow edema or marrow replacement. There is mild generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects early disc desiccation. There is mild associated disc space narrowing at T12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3. The remainder of the lumbar disc spaces, including the well-formed transitional S1-S2 disc space, maintain normal height. There are intraosseous discal herniations at all levels from T12-L1 through L4-L5. At L1-L2, there is also left paracentral posterior herniation of the disc, which deforms the left ventral thecal sac. ----- Page Break ----- There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L5-S1 or S1-S2.

Transitional lumbarized S1 vertebra, with a well-formed S1-S2 disc space. The numbering of the vertebrae was performed in conjunction with the thoracic spine MRI performed on the same date.

Status post injury in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 1.5 Tesla high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis. Vertebral height and configuration are normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, although there may be minor endplate changes at L5-S1. There is mild disc signal loss at L2-L3 and more significant disc signal loss from L3-L4 through L5-S1, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing from L3-L4 through L5-S1. There is mild anterior vertebral spurring in the mid-lower lumbar region. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is developmental asymmetry of facet joint orientation/configuration at L5-S1, which results in relative developmental narrowing of the left neural foramen at this level. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1 or L1-L2. At L2-L3, there is annular bulging, which flattens the thecal sac. At L3-L4 and L4-L5, there are annular bulges, which flatten the thecal sac and encroach upon the neural foramina bilaterally, to a slightly greater degree at the latter level. At L5-S1, there is posterocentral herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular ----- Page Break ----- bulging and posterior vertebral spurring. Findings result in ventral canal encroachment with mass effect on the thecal sac and S1 nerve root origins, as well as bilateral foraminal encroachment. There is a slightly greater degree of left foraminal narrowing at this level secondary to the asymmetric facet joint configuration described above. The central spinal canal is developmentally small in the lumbar region. Canal caliber is further compromised from L2-L3 through L5-S1 by the aforementioned disc pathology. Consequently, there is central spinal stenosis from L2-L3 through L5-S1, which becomes more significant at lower lumbar levels (mild at L2-L3, and moderate-severe at L5-S1, with more intermediate grades of stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5). The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Annular bulges at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5, which result in: A) mass effect on the thecal sac at all levels. B) bilateral foraminal encroachment at L3-L4 and L4-L5, slightly more marked at L4-L5. 2. Posterocentral disc herniation at L5-S1, superimposed upon annular bulging/vertebral spurring. Findings result in: A) mass effect on the thecal sac and S1 nerve root origins. B) bilateral foraminal narrowing (slightly worse on the left secondary to developmental factors). 3. Central spinal stenosis, L2-L3 through L5-S1, with more significant degrees of stenosis at lower lumbar levels, especially at L5-S1. The stenosis is secondary to both underlying developmental factors and superimposed acquired disc pathology. 4. Lumbar straightening, which may be related to muscle spasm/pain.

COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which will be designated ""L5"" for the purposes of this examination. Please correlate with plain films. Accordingly, the L5-S1 disc space is transitional in nature and the conus medullaris is situated at T12-L1. Sagittal images demonstrate a normal lumbar lordosis, with retrolisthesis at L1-L2. Evaluation of vertebral configuration demonstrates mild anterior wedging of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies, which is related to chronic compression deformities of their superior endplates. The remainder of the lumbar vertebrae maintain normal height. Evaluation of vertebral marrow signal demonstrates Modic type II endplate changes at the superior endplates of T12 and L1. There are also mild Modic type II endplate changes at the L1-L2 disc level. There is no evidence of marrow edema or marrow replacement. There is nearly generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing at T12-L1 and L1-L2.

Status post motor vehicle collision on MM/DD/YYYY. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis. Vertebral height and configuration are normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal. There are localized Modic type II endplate changes at L2-L3 posteriorly toward the left. There is also localized Modic type II endplate change at the anteroinferior corner of T11, in association with an intraosseous discal herniation. The lumbar disc spaces maintain normal height. There is loss of disc signal at the L2-L3 and L3-L4 levels, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the lumbar disc spaces maintain relatively normal signal intensity characteristics for the patient's age. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1, L1-L2 or L2-L3. At L2-L3, there is mild left posterolateral vertebral spurring, in association with the aforementioned endplate changes, with minor left foraminal encroachment. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L3-L4, L4-L5 or L5-S1. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is facet hypertrophy from L1-L2 through L4-L5, with an anteroposterior orientation of the facet joint spaces in the upper lumbar region. There is also facet joint arthropathy at L4-L5 bilaterally. The hypertrophic facet joints encroach upon the dorsolateral aspects of the central spinal ----- Page Break ----- canal, especially from L2-L3 through L4-L5. There are facet joint effusions at many levels. There is narrowing of the bony central spinal canal in much of the lumbar region secondary to the hypertrophic facet joints, especially from L2-L3 through L4-L5, which is compatible with central spinal stenosis. There is also increased epidural fat in the mid-lower lumbar region, with secondary constriction of the thecal sac. This is compatible with epidural lipomatosis. The neural foramina are bilaterally patent, with the exception of minor left foraminal encroachment at L2-L3, as noted above. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. There is nonspecific edema of the posterior subcutaneous fat, which is likely related to patient body habitus. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1.

A few, less than 1 cm gallstones are noted. The gallbladder otherwise appears normal. The spleen and adrenal glands are normal in size and signal characteristics and show no focal lesions. An oval-shaped, complex, heterogeneous enhancing mass is present in the body of the pancreas, measuring approximately 4 x 5 x 7 cm in the longitudinal, AP and transverse dimensions. This partially encases the splenic artery and is consistent with a carcinoma. The fat planes about the SMA are preserved. No additional focal pancreatic lesions are identified. There is no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation. An approximately 3 cm filling defect is noted in the splenic vein, at the level of the aforementioned carcinoma, consistent with thrombus. The remainder of the splenic vein and portal veins appear normal. ----- Page Break ----- The kidneys are normal in size, shape and position. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Bilateral renal cysts are noted, the largest measuring approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter. No additional discrete renal masses are identified. Oval-shaped, enhancing structures are present in the greater omentum, anterior to the left hepatic lobe, demonstrating maximum diameters of approximately 1 and 3 cm, respectively. These have not changed significantly in size compared with prior studies dating to MM/DD/YYYY and are likely iatrogenic. No additional discrete omental masses are identified.

Status post motor vehicle collision in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: MRI examination of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY and X-ray examination of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate accentuation of the normal lumbar lordosis. Vertebral height and marrow signal are normal. (Please note that the L5 vertebra is transitional in nature, with a broad left transverse process that appears to articulate with the sacrum, as seen on the previous plain film examination.) The lumbar disc spaces maintain normal height. There is mild generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects early disc desiccation. There are intraosseous discal herniations at every level from T11-T12 through L5-S1, with the exception of the L4-L5 disc level. This may be compatible with Scheuermann's disease. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is mild relative hypoplasia of the left facet joint at L5-S1. There is a small neocyst at the posteroinferior aspect of the left facet joint at L4-L5. There is probably an additional small neocyst at the posteroinferior aspect of the right facet joint at L3-L4.

Pelvis and bilateral hip radiographs from PHI/DD/YYYY. Bilateral hip MR examinations from PHI/DD/YYYY. Technique: The left hip was imaged in a 1.5 Tesla high field magnetic resonance imaging unit. Bilateral field-of-view coronal STIR images were obtained together with unilateral field-of-view coronal fat-saturated proton density images; axial fat-saturated proton density images; sagittal proton density images; and oblique axial proton density images created parallel to the long axis of the acetabular fossa. Findings: The skin and subcutis are unremarkable. Active inflammatory synovitis in both hips has improved markedly since the MM/DD/YYYY MR examination. There is only a small amount of residual synovitis in both hips, slightly more so on the left. See coronal images 13-15 of series 3. No bursal effusion is visualized. The visualized muscle-tendon units are unremarkable. There is no evidence of stress injury, fracture, osteonecrosis, osteomyelitis or osseous neoplasm. No morphologic changes of developmental dysplasia are visualized in either hip. Coronal images 18-19 of series 4 demonstrate a small developing tear in the anterosuperior labrum of the left acetabulum. This is new compared to the previous study. ----- Page Break ----- A small chronic partial tear of the posterosuperior labrum of the contralateral (right) acetabulum is visualized to limited extent on coronal image 13 of series 3, but is better seen on the concurrent right hip MR images. This finding is less conspicuous in the absence of significant joint fluid. It is either unchanged, or slightly healed in the interval. There are no morphologic changes to suggest femoroacetabular impingement. Generalized articular cartilage thinning in the left hip joint is unchanged compared to the prior study. Again noted is partial lumbarization of the S1 sacrum. The visualized neurovascular structures are unremarkable. No extrapelvic soft tissue mass or fluid collection is visualized. The visualized pelvic visceral structures demonstrate no non-contrast MR abnormality. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: Small developing tear in the anterosuperior labrum of the left acetabulum, new compared to the prior study from PHI/DD/YYYY. Marked reduction in active synovitis at the hips since the previous study from PHI/DD/YYYY. Articular cortical thinning in the left hip joint is unchanged. A small chronic partial tear of the posterosuperior labrum of the right acetabulum is either unchanged or slightly healed in the interval since the previous study. See description above.
