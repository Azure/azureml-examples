TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained on a 1.2 Tesla open MR scanner. COMPARISON: A previous MR scan of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY was available for review. FINDINGS: No fractures, lytic, or blastic disease is identified. The conus is normal in signal and ends at the level of the L1-2 interspace. The thecal sac is mildly anomalous as it ends at approximately the L5 level with the more distal roots coursing through intraspinal fat. No abnormal intradural filling defects are demonstrated. At L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4, the discs are preserved. The canal and foramen are clear. At L4-5, the disc is abnormal in signal, bulges slightly, and demonstrates a focal projection into the midline and right side of the ventral epidural space consistent with a herniation. The herniation extends slightly inferior from the actual level of the interspace in the ventral epidural space. A very subtle degenerative retrolisthesis of L4 posteriorly on L5 accompanies these changes. The configuration of the facets plus the bulge and herniation cause a mild to moderate bilateral lateral recess stenosis of the canal through which both L5 roots traverse. The herniation causes minimal if any defect on the thecal sac due to the configuration of the thecal sac with a relatively ""early termination"". The foramen are clear. At L5-S1, a focal projection of the disc in the midline extending to the right is consistent with a herniation and is compressing the right S1 nerve root in the lateral recess. The foramen are clear. ----- Page Break ----- ------------------------- IMPRESSION: No change from the prior examination. Herniations at L4-5 and L5-S1 are present.

Status post motor vehicle collision in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: There is apparently a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which corresponds to a lumbarized S1 vertebra, with a well-formed S1-S2 disc space. This was determined in conjunction with the thoracic spine study performed on the same date. Accordingly, there are 6 lumbar type vertebral bodies, and the conus medullaris is situated at L1-L2. Sagittal images demonstrate mild accentuation of the normal lumbar lordosis. Evaluation of vertebral configuration demonstrates mild anterior wedging of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies, which may represent normal anatomic variation or possibly mild chronic compression deformities. The remainder of the lumbar vertebrae, as well as the lumbarized S1 vertebra, maintain normal height. Vertebral marrow signal is normal. There is no evidence of marrow edema or marrow replacement. There is mild generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects early disc desiccation. There is mild associated disc space narrowing at T12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3. The remainder of the lumbar disc spaces, including the well-formed transitional S1-S2 disc space, maintain normal height. There are intraosseous discal herniations at all levels from T12-L1 through L4-L5. At L1-L2, there is also left paracentral posterior herniation of the disc, which deforms the left ventral thecal sac. ----- Page Break ----- There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L5-S1 or S1-S2.

Status post injury in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 1.5 Tesla high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis. Vertebral height and configuration are normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, although there may be minor endplate changes at L5-S1. There is mild disc signal loss at L2-L3 and more significant disc signal loss from L3-L4 through L5-S1, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing from L3-L4 through L5-S1. There is mild anterior vertebral spurring in the mid-lower lumbar region. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is developmental asymmetry of facet joint orientation/configuration at L5-S1, which results in relative developmental narrowing of the left neural foramen at this level. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1 or L1-L2. At L2-L3, there is annular bulging, which flattens the thecal sac. At L3-L4 and L4-L5, there are annular bulges, which flatten the thecal sac and encroach upon the neural foramina bilaterally, to a slightly greater degree at the latter level. At L5-S1, there is posterocentral herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular ----- Page Break ----- bulging and posterior vertebral spurring. Findings result in ventral canal encroachment with mass effect on the thecal sac and S1 nerve root origins, as well as bilateral foraminal encroachment. There is a slightly greater degree of left foraminal narrowing at this level secondary to the asymmetric facet joint configuration described above. The central spinal canal is developmentally small in the lumbar region. Canal caliber is further compromised from L2-L3 through L5-S1 by the aforementioned disc pathology. Consequently, there is central spinal stenosis from L2-L3 through L5-S1, which becomes more significant at lower lumbar levels (mild at L2-L3, and moderate-severe at L5-S1, with more intermediate grades of stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5). The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Annular bulges at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5, which result in: A) mass effect on the thecal sac at all levels. B) bilateral foraminal encroachment at L3-L4 and L4-L5, slightly more marked at L4-L5. 2. Posterocentral disc herniation at L5-S1, superimposed upon annular bulging/vertebral spurring. Findings result in: A) mass effect on the thecal sac and S1 nerve root origins. B) bilateral foraminal narrowing (slightly worse on the left secondary to developmental factors). 3. Central spinal stenosis, L2-L3 through L5-S1, with more significant degrees of stenosis at lower lumbar levels, especially at L5-S1. The stenosis is secondary to both underlying developmental factors and superimposed acquired disc pathology. 4. Lumbar straightening, which may be related to muscle spasm/pain.

Status post motor vehicle collision in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which will be designated ""L5"" for the purposes of this examination. Please correlate with plain films. Accordingly, the L5-S1 disc space is transitional in nature and the conus medullaris is situated at T12-L1. Sagittal images demonstrate a normal lumbar lordosis, with retrolisthesis at L1-L2. Evaluation of vertebral configuration demonstrates mild anterior wedging of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies, which is related to chronic compression deformities of their superior endplates. The remainder of the lumbar vertebrae maintain normal height. Evaluation of vertebral marrow signal demonstrates Modic type II endplate changes at the superior endplates of T12 and L1. There are also mild Modic type II endplate changes at the L1-L2 disc level. There is no evidence of marrow edema or marrow replacement. There is nearly generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing at T12-L1 and L1-L2. The L5-S1 disc space is also much smaller than the more superior lumbar disc spaces secondary to its transitional nature. There is anterior vertebral spurring at T12-L1 and L1-L2. At T12-L1, there is a prominent inferiorly directed intraosseous discal herniation, which involves the superior endplate of L1. There is also annular bulging at this level. ----- Page Break ----- At L1-L2, there is left foraminal herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular bulging, and associated with posterior vertebral subluxation. Findings result in foraminal encroachment, more marked on the left, and flattening of the ventral thecal sac. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L2-L3. At L3-L4, there is right foraminal herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular bulging. Findings result in foraminal encroachment, more marked on the right, with impingement of the exiting right L3 nerve root, as well as flattening of the ventral thecal sac. At L4-L5, there is right foraminal herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular bulging. Findings result in foraminal encroachment, more marked on the right, with impingement of the exiting right L4 nerve root, as well as effacement of the ventral epidural fat. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L5-S1. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is right facet joint arthropathy at L4-L5. There is facet joint hypoplasia at L5-S1, as well as facet joint asymmetry. There is no evidence of significant central spinal stenosis. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Chronic compression deformities of the superior endplates of T12 and L1. 2.

There is loss of disc signal at the L2-L3 and L3-L4 levels, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the lumbar disc spaces maintain relatively normal signal intensity characteristics for the patient's age. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1, L1-L2 or L2-L3. At L2-L3, there is mild left posterolateral vertebral spurring, in association with the aforementioned endplate changes, with minor left foraminal encroachment. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L3-L4, L4-L5 or L5-S1. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is facet hypertrophy from L1-L2 through L4-L5, with an anteroposterior orientation of the facet joint spaces in the upper lumbar region. There is also facet joint arthropathy at L4-L5 bilaterally. The hypertrophic facet joints encroach upon the dorsolateral aspects of the central spinal ----- Page Break ----- canal, especially from L2-L3 through L4-L5. There are facet joint effusions at many levels. There is narrowing of the bony central spinal canal in much of the lumbar region secondary to the hypertrophic facet joints, especially from L2-L3 through L4-L5, which is compatible with central spinal stenosis. There is also increased epidural fat in the mid-lower lumbar region, with secondary constriction of the thecal sac. This is compatible with epidural lipomatosis. The neural foramina are bilaterally patent, with the exception of minor left foraminal encroachment at L2-L3, as noted above. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. There is nonspecific edema of the posterior subcutaneous fat, which is likely related to patient body habitus. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1.

TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: The lumbosacral spine is normally aligned. There is a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which will be designated ""L5"" for the purposes of this examination. It articulates with the sacrum on the left. Accordingly, the L5-S1 disc space is transitional nature and the conus medullaris is likely situated at the T11-T12 level, which is not included in the field of view. Vertebral height and configuration are normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, with minor endplate changes anteriorly at several levels. There is prominent fatty marrow within the pedicles of L4 bilaterally. Incidental note is also made of a probable small vertebral hemangioma of L1, which demonstrates increased signal on all pulse sequences. There is mild generalized loss of disc signal in the lumbar region, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects early disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing at T12-L1. The L5-S1 disc space is also smaller than the more superior lumbar disc spaces secondary to its transitional nature. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is bilateral facet joint arthropathy at L3-L4 and L4-L5. There is facet joint hypoplasia at L5-S1, which is related to the transitional nature of this articulation. There are facet joint effusions at many levels. There is also edema of the interspinous space at L4-L5, which is secondary to injury of the interspinous ligament at this level. ----- Page Break ----- There are intraosseous discal herniations at every level from T11-T12 through L3-L4, as well as at L5-S1. At T12-L1 1, there is also left paracentral herniation of the disc, which deforms the left ventral thecal sac. There are also annular bulges at L1-L2, L2-L3 and L3-L4. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L4-L5. There is no evidence of significant central spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are bilaterally patent. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Intraosseous discal herniations at nearly all levels from T11-T12 through L5-S1.

COMPARISON: X-ray examination of the lumbar spine, dated MM/DD/YYYY. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate mild accentuation of the normal lumbar lordosis. There is a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction, which will be designated ""S1"" for the purposes of this examination.

There is loss of disc signal at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels, on the T2-weighted sequence, accompanied by mild disc space narrowing at L5-S1. This reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the visualized disc spaces maintain normal height and signal intensity characteristics. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation from T12-L1 through L3-L4. At L4-L5, there is left foraminal herniation of the disc, with left foraminal encroachment and impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root.

Unsteady gait. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal, coronal, and axial images of the brain were obtained with a 3 Tesla MR scanner. COMPARISON: No prior correlative imaging was available for review. FINDINGS: An approximately 3.5 cm region of parenchymal tissue abnormality is present in the right side of the cerebellum. The abnormality is adjacent to the right side of the fourth ventricle. The right side of the fourth ventricle may be slightly flattened. The area of abnormality extends from the ependymal surface of the fourth ventricle into the right brachium pontis and the right dentate nucleus and to the anterior surface of the right brachium pontis. The region is characterized by scattered areas of abnormal signal with a small associated region of tissue loss and also includes susceptibility artifact consistent with remote blood products. No acute hemorrhages are demonstrated. No acute infarcts are demonstrated. Both vertebral arteries and the basilar artery appear to be normally developed and are patent. Both internal carotid arteries are also patent. An approximately 6 to 7 cm CSF containing structure is present in the posterior fossa between the inferior portions of the cerebellar hemispheres posterior to the inferior vermis and is consistent with a large cisterna magna or arachnoid cyst. A mild degree of remodeling of the overlying occipital bone is present. Otherwise, no mass effect from the cyst is present as the adjacent cerebellar hemispheres appear mildly hypoplastic in this region. The ventricular system is normal in size and position. Supratentorially, the brain is normal in signal and is normally formed. The paranasal sinuses are clear. The right middle turbinate is pneumatized (concha bullosa) and the nasal septum is deviated to the left. At the time of my review, we communicated with the referring physician. ----- Page Break ----- ------------------------- IMPRESSION: Old hemorrhagic infarct in the right side of the cerebellum. In general, some volume loss in this region is appreciated though slight flattening of the right side of the fourth ventricle suggests a mild degree of mass effect, possibly residual edema, is present. A follow-up scan would be useful for confirmation.

C16.9; C25.9 An MR examination of the abdomen and MRCP were performed with images obtained in multiple planes both before and following intravenous contrast administration of 11 cc Gadavist. Comparison is made with prior studies, the most recent dated MM/DD/YYYY. The visualized portions of the lung bases are normal. No pleural or pericardial effusions are present. The liver is normal in size and demonstrates a heterogeneous signal intensity pattern consistent with fatty infiltration with areas of focal sparing. Cysts are noted in the right and left hepatic lobes, the largest measuring approximately 1.5 cm in maximum diameter. No additional discrete hepatic lesions are identified. The biliary tree is nondilated. The CBD measures 7 mm in maximum diameter. No strictures, filling defects or enhancing lesions are identified within the biliary tree. A few, less than 1 cm gallstones are noted. The gallbladder otherwise appears normal. The spleen and adrenal glands are normal in size and signal characteristics and show no focal lesions. An oval-shaped, complex, heterogeneous enhancing mass is present in the body of the pancreas, measuring approximately 4 x 5 x 7 cm in the longitudinal, AP and transverse dimensions. This partially encases the splenic artery and is consistent with a carcinoma. The fat planes about the SMA are preserved. No additional focal pancreatic lesions are identified. There is no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation. An approximately 3 cm filling defect is noted in the splenic vein, at the level of the aforementioned carcinoma, consistent with thrombus. The remainder of the splenic vein and portal veins appear normal. ----- Page Break ----- The kidneys are normal in size, shape and position. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Bilateral renal cysts are noted, the largest measuring approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter. No additional discrete renal masses are identified. Oval-shaped, enhancing structures are present in the greater omentum, anterior to the left hepatic lobe, demonstrating maximum diameters of approximately 1 and 3 cm, respectively. These have not changed significantly in size compared with prior studies dating to MM/DD/YYYY and are likely iatrogenic. No additional discrete omental masses are identified. No enlarged lymph nodes or fluid collections are seen within the abdomen. The patient is status post partial gastrectomy. The remaining visualized bowel and mesentery appear normal. No focal bony lesions are identified. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Pancreatic carcinoma with partial thrombosis of the splenic vein.

Status post motor vehicle collision in MONTH XX. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 3.0 Tesla ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: The lumbosacral spine is normally aligned. Vertebral height and configuration are generally normal, although there may be mild anterior wedging of the L2 vertebral body. Please correlate with plain films. Evaluation of vertebral marrow signal demonstrates generally mild multilevel vertebral endplate changes, with Modic type I changes at L4-L5 posteriorly and at L5-S1 toward the left. There is also a small round hyperintense focus within the right side of the L4 vertebral body peripherally, as seen on T2-weighted/STIR images, which is a nonspecific finding that is of uncertain etiology or significance. There is loss of disc signal from L1-L2 through L5-S1, on the T2-weighted sequence, associated with disc space narrowing and vertebral spurring. This reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the visualized disc spaces maintain relatively normal height and signal intensity characteristics. There are intraosseous discal herniations at T11-T12, L1-L2 and L2-L3. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1. At L1-L2, there is also broad right paracentral posterior herniation of the disc, which flattens the right ventral thecal sac. At L2-L3, there is broad posterocentral herniation of the disc, slightly larger on the ----- Page Break ----- right, which also deforms the ventral thecal sac. At L3-L4, there is annular bulging, which flattens the ventral thecal sac. At L4-L5, there is a left paracentral superior disc extrusion along the posterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body. This is superimposed upon annular bulging and posterior/posterolateral vertebral spurring, slightly larger on the right. Findings result in effacement of the ventral epidural fat and bilateral foraminal encroachment, slightly more marked on the right. At L5-S1, there is posterocentral herniation of the disc, superimposed upon annular bulging and posterior/posterolateral vertebral spurring, slightly larger on the left. Findings result in ventral canal encroachment, as well as predominant left foraminal encroachment with impingement of the exiting left L5 nerve root. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is developmental asymmetry of facet joint orientation at L5-S1. There are facet joint effusions at multiple levels. There is no evidence of central spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are bilaterally patent, with the exceptions noted above. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Questionable mild anterior wedging of L2, which raises the possibility of a chronic compression deformity. Please correlate with plain films. 2. Intraosseous discal herniations at T11-T12, L1-L2 and L2-L3. 3. Broad right paracentral disc herniation at L1-L2, which flattens the right ventral thecal sac. 4.

Possible cavernous aneurysm of the right internal carotid is seen on a previous MR angiogram. TECHNIQUE: An initial single diffusion weighted imaging sequence over the head was acquired. Then MR angiography of the craniocervical vessels was undertaken. The vessels from the aortic arch to the skull base were imaged with two-dimensional and three-dimensional data acquisitions before and after the administration of intravenous contrast (10 cc Gadavist). The intracranial circulation was imaged with a three-dimensional data acquisition. The data sets were reconstructed into two-dimensional and three-dimensional renderings which were reviewed in multiple projections.

Angiography demonstrates that the origins of the great vessels are normal. The left vertebral artery origin is directly from the aortic arch, a normal variant. Both vertebral arteries are normal in caliber and flow to the vertebrobasilar junction which is also normal. The basilar artery is normal and flows to both posterior cerebral arteries. The right common carotid artery bifurcation in the neck is normal. The right internal carotid artery flows to the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries and also to the right posterior cerebral artery via a well-developed right posterior communicating artery. The left common carotid artery bifurcation in the neck is normal.

Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, with the exception of minor endplate change at the anterosuperior corner of L2. There is loss of disc signal at the L4-L5 level, on the T2-weighted sequence, accompanied by mild disc space narrowing. This reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the visualized disc spaces maintain normal height and relatively normal signal intensity characteristics for the patient's age.

COMPARISON: MRI examination of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY and X-ray examination of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY. FINDINGS: Sagittal images demonstrate retrolisthesis at L2-L3. Vertebral height is normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, with mixed endplate changes at multiple levels, most diffusely at L5-S1. There is loss of disc signal from L2-L3 through L5-S1, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. There is associated disc space narrowing at L4-L5 and especially at L5-S1. The remainder of the visualized disc spaces maintain normal height and relatively normal signal intensity characteristics. There is anterior vertebral spurring in the lumbar region. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1 or L1-L2. At L2-L3, there is annular bulging and posterior vertebral spurring, as well as posterior vertebral subluxation, which flattens the ventral thecal sac. This was present on the previous study.

TECHNIQUE: MRA and MRV of the brain was performed on a 3.0 Tesla superconducting magnet utilizing 3-D time-of-flight technique in the region of the circle of FIRSTNAME and Major venous structures. 3-D reconstructions were performed on a workstation. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed. FINDINGS: MRA: Incidental note of fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery which is a normal anatomic variant. Incidental note of an azygos artery which is a normal anatomic variant. No major stenosis, aneurysm, or dissection. No vascular malformation. No evidence of vasculitis. MRV: Very attenuated left transverse sinus. The left sigmoid sinus is asymmetrically smaller than the left as is the left internal jugular vein. This could reflect a normal anatomic variant dominant right transverse sinus. Less likely is chronic thrombosis of the left transverse sinus. I do not see any abnormal signal on the brain MRI. The remainder of the venous anatomy is within normal limits. Should be noted that the contrast-enhanced MRA of the neck was performed after acquisition of the MRV without contrast.

The examination was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet. Comparison: Note is made of recent CT angiogram of the abdomen dated MM/DD/YYYY. Findings: LIVER: Evaluation of the liver demonstrates a 3.1 x 2.8 cm rounded somewhat heterogeneous structure along the left hepatic dome laterally. This demonstrates areas of bright T1 and T2 signal intensity with no evidence of fat suppression likely representing a cyst containing hemorrhagic content. A probable internal septation is present. No definite internal enhancement is appreciated on subtraction imaging although this evaluation slightly limited due to motion artifact. This previously measured 3.4 x 2.6 cm on the prior CT of MM/DD/YYYY and demonstrated minimally increased attenuation compared with simple fluid at the time of the prior examination. There are scattered few additional cysts in the liver measuring up to 1.8 cm along the margin right hepatic lobe posteriorly. A small flash filling hemangioma is also noted in the left hepatic dome medially measuring 5 mm in diameter. There is no definite evidence of hepatic steatosis. Apparent elongation right hepatic lobe posteriorly is noted, likely to Riedel's morphology measuring 19.7 cm in craniocaudad dimension. GALLBLADDER/BILIARY TREE:The gallbladder is present.

The hepatic veins, and the renal veins, the splenic and portal vein are patent. MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no aggressive osseous lesions. Benign hemangiomas are noted in the lower thoracic spine. ADDITIONAL: There is no free fluid. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: Scattered hepatic cysts as well as a complex cyst in the left lateral hepatic dome, likely a cyst containing hemorrhagic or proteinaceous content. This is slightly smaller in size since the prior CT examination and demonstrates more heterogeneity, likely related to internal hemorrhage.

Status post injury in PHI. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 1.5 Tesla high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: MRI examination of the lumbar spine dated MM/DD/YYYY FINDINGS: The lumbosacral spine is normally aligned. Vertebral height and marrow signal are normal. The lumbar disc spaces maintain generally normal height, although there may be mild disc space narrowing at L4-L5. There is loss of disc signal from L2-L3 through L4-L5, on the T2-weighted sequence, which reflects disc desiccation. The remainder of the lumbar intervertebral discs maintain relatively normal signal intensity characteristics for the patient's age. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at T12-L1, L1-L2 or L2-L3. At L3-L4, there is annular bulging, slightly asymmetric toward the right, which encroaches upon the inferior foramina bilaterally, slightly more significantly on the right side. At L4-L5, there is annular bulging, slightly asymmetric toward the left, which effaces the ventral epidural fat and encroaches upon the neural foramina bilaterally, slightly more significantly on the left, with impingement of the exiting L4 nerve roots on both sides. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation at L5-S1. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. Incidental note is made of a more coronal orientation of the facet joints at L4-L5 and L5-S1. ----- Page Break ----- There is no evidence of significant central spinal stenosis in the lumbar region. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1. Annular bulge at L3-L4, slightly asymmetric toward the right, with bilateral foraminal encroachment, slightly more marked on the right. 2. Annular bulge at L4-L5, slightly asymmetric toward the left, which results in: A) ventral canal encroachment.

TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a 1.5 Tesla high field magnetic resonance imaging unit with sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR sequences, as well as axial proton density images through the lumbar disc spaces. COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: The lumbosacral spine is normally aligned. Vertebral height and configuration are normal. Vertebral marrow signal is generally normal, with the exception of endplate changes at L5-S1. There are also minor nonspecific subchondral cysts of the facet joints at L3-L4. The T12-L1 through L3-L4 intervertebral discs maintain normal height and signal intensity characteristics. There is loss of disc signal at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels, on the T2-weighted sequence, accompanied by disc space narrowing at L5-S1. This reflects disc desiccation. There is also anterior vertebral spurring in the lower lumbar region. There is no evidence of disc bulge or herniation from T12-L1 through L3-L4. At L4-L5 and L5-S1, there are annular bulges, slightly asymmetric toward the left, which flatten the ventral thecal sac and encroach upon the neural foramina, slightly more significantly on the left side at both levels. There is consequent impingement of the exiting left L5 nerve at L5-S1. The facet joints demonstrate normal alignment. There is an anteroposterior orientation of the facet joints in the upper-mid lumbar region. There is hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava at L4-L5 and L5-S1, with dorsal canal encroachment. There is mild central spinal stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 secondary to the aforementioned ----- Page Break ----- annular bulges and ligamentous hypertrophy. There is no evidence of significant central spinal stenosis in the remainder of the lumbar region. The conus medullaris is normal in position and appearance. There are atrophic changes of the posterior paraspinal muscles. There are otherwise no prevertebral or paraspinal abnormalities. ------------------------- IMPRESSION: 1.
