    "Online endpoints give a durable REST API that can be used to integrate with applications that need to use the model. Create an online endpoint and then create an online deployment. You need to specify the Virtual Machine instance or SKU when creating the deployment. You can find the optimal CPU or GPU SKU for a model by opening the quick deployment dialog from the model page in the AzureML Model Catalog. Specify the SKU in the `instance_type` input in deployment settings below.\n",

    "Typically Online Endpoints require you to provide scoring script and a docker container image (through an AzureML environment), in addition to the model. You don't need to worry about them for HuggingFace Hub models available in AzureML Model Catalog because we have enabled 'no code deployments' for these models by packaging scoring script and container image along with the model.\n",
