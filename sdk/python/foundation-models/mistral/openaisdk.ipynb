    "Use `openai` SDK to consume Mistral deployments in Azure AI and Azure ML. The Mistral family of models in Azure AI and Azure ML offers an API compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It allows customers and users to transition seamlessly from OpenAI models to Mistral LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API can be directly used with OpenAI's client libraries or third-party tools, like LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows how to make this transition using the OpenAI Python Library. Notice that Mistral supports only chat completions API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Review the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-mistral) for the Mistral family of models at for AI Studio and for ML Studio for details on how to provision inference endpoints, regional availability, pricing and inference schema reference."
