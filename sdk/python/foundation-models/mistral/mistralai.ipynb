    "* Register for a valid Azure account with subscription \n",

    "    > Notice that some models may not be available in all the regions in Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning. On those cases, you can create a workspace or project in the region where the models are available and then consume it with a connection from a different one. To learn more about using connections see [Consume models with connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deployments-connections)\n",
