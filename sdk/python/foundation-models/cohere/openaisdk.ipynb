    "Use `openai` SDK to consume Mistral deployments in Azure AI and Azure ML. The Cohere family of models in Azure AI and Azure ML offers an API compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It allows customers and users to transition seamlessly from OpenAI models to Cohere LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API can be directly used with OpenAI's client libraries or third-party tools, like LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n",

    "* Register for a valid Azure account with subscription \n",
    "* Make sure you have access to [Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio?tabs=home)\n",

    "\n",
    "    > Notice that some models may not be available in all the regions in Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning. On those cases, you can create a workspace or project in the region where the models are available and then consume it with a connection from a different one. To learn more about using connections see [Consume models with connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deployments-connections)\n",
