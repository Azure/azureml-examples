    "Use `openai` SDK to consume `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct` deployments through Azure AI and Azure ML, which offers an API compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It allows customers and users to transition seamlessly from OpenAI models to Llama 3.1 LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API can be directly used with OpenAI's client libraries or third-party tools, like LangChain or LiteLLM.\n",

    "The example below shows how to make this transition using the OpenAI Python Library. Notice that the Azure AI chat completions API supports only a portion of the parameters supported by OpenAI API.\n",
