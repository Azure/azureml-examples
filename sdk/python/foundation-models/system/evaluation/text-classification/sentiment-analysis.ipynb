    "\n",
    "### Evaluation dataset\n",
    "The Stanford Sentiment Treebank consists of sentences from movie reviews and human annotations of their sentiment. The task is to predict the sentiment of a given sentence. It uses the two-way (positive/negative) class split, with only sentence-level labels. The [SST2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/validation) dataset is a subset of the larger [General Language Understanding Evaluation](https://gluebenchmark.com/) dataset. A copy of this dataset is available in the [glue-sst2-dataset](./glue-sst2-dataset/) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "The goal of evaluating models is to compare their performance on a variety of metrics. `text-classification` is generic task type that can be used for scenarios such as sentiment analysis, emotion detection, grammar checking, spam filtering, etc. As such, the models you pick to compare must be finetuned for same scenario. Given that we have the sentiment analysis dataset, we would like to look for models finetuned for this specific scenario. We will compare `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` and `finiteautomata-bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis` in this sample, which are available in the `azureml` system registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to evaluate models that are not in the system registry, you can import those models to your workspace or organization registry and then evaluate them using the approach outlined in this sample. Review the sample notebook for [importing models](../../import/import-model-from-huggingface.ipynb). \n",

Refer to the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) for this information. The number of GPU cards per node is set in the param `gpus_per_node` below.
