    "This sample shows how use the evaluate a group of models against a given set of metrics for the `text-named-entity-recognition` task. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation dataset\n",
    "The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second a part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag B-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2 tagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1. Reference [CoNLL-2003](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "The goal of evaluating models is to compare their performance on a variety of metrics. `text-named-entity-recognition` is generic task type that can be used for scenarios to recognise named entities such as persons, locations, organizations, etc. As such, the models you pick to compare must be finetuned for same scenario. Given that we have the CoNLL-2003 dataset, we would like to look for models finetuned for this specific scenario. We will review `jean-baptiste-camembert-ner` in this sample, which is available in the `azureml` system registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to evaluate models that are not in the system registry, you can import those models to your workspace or organization registry and then evaluate them using the approach outlined in this sample.\n",
