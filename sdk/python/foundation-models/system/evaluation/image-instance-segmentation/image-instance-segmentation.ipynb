    "The goal of evaluating models is to compare their performance on a variety of metrics. `image-instance-segmentation` is a generic task type. As such, the models you pick to compare must be finetuned for the same scenario. Given that we have the dataset, we would like to look for models finetuned for this specific scenario. We will compare different versions of `mmd-3x-mask-rcnn_swin-t-p4-w7_fpn_1x_coco` in this sample, which are available in the `azureml` system registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to evaluate models that are not in the system registry, you can import those models to your workspace or organization registry and then evaluate them using the approach outlined in this sample. Review the sample notebook for [importing models](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb).\n",
