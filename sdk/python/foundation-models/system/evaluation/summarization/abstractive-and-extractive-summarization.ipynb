    "\n",
    "### Evaluation dataset\n",
    "The CNN / DailyMail Dataset is an English-language dataset containing just over 300k unique news articles as written by journalists at CNN and the Daily Mail. The current version supports both extractive and abstractive summarization, though the original version was created for machine reading and comprehension and abstractive question answering. Reference [cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "The goal of evaluating models is to compare their performance on a variety of metrics. `text-summarization` is generic task type that can be used for scenarios such as abstractive and extractive summarization. As such, the models you pick to compare must be finetuned for same scenario. Given that we have the CNN_Dailymail dataset, we would like to look for models finetuned for this specific scenario. We will compare `sshleifer-distilbart-cnn-12-6`, and `facebook-bart-large-cnn` in this sample, which are available in the `azureml` system registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to evaluate models that are not in the system registry, you can import those models to your workspace or organization registry and then evaluate them using the approach outlined in this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "* Setup pre-requisites such as compute.\n",
    "* Pick the models to evaluate.\n",
    "* Pick and explore evaluate data.\n",
    "* Configure the evaluation jobs.\n",

Refer to the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) for this information. The number of GPU cards per node is set in the param `gpus_per_node` below.
