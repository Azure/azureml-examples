    "## Import models from MMDetection hub\n",
    "This sample shows how to import and register `image-object-detection` and `image-instance-segmentation`, models from MMDetection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does import work?\n",
    "The import process runs as a job in your AzureML workspace using components from the `azureml` system registry. The models are downloaded and converted to MLflow packaged format. You can then register the models to your AzureML Workspace or Registry that makes them available for inference or fine tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What models are supported for import?\n",
    "Any object detection and instance segmentation model from MMDetection can be imported. Only the following set of tasks are supported for MLflow conversion:\n",
    "* image-object-detection\n",
    "* image-instance-segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why convert to MLflow?\n",
    "MLflow is AzureML's recommended model packaging format. \n",
    "* **Evaluation benefits**: Foundation models imported and converted to MLflow format can be Evaluated using AzureML's Evaluation pipelines. You can use the no-code UI wizards, or the code-based job submission with the SDK or CLI/YAML. AzureML's Evaluation pipelines are built using components. This gives you the flexibility to compose your own Evaluation pipelines using AzureML Evaluation Components and evaluate your Model's performance on standard or custom dataset(s) to take informed decision on whether to deploy the base model directly or further fine-tune it before deployment. Learn more about AzureML Evaluation pipelines using [SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/mabables/foundation-models/sdk/python/foundation-models/system/evaluation) or [CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/mabables/foundation-models/cli/foundation-models/system/evaluation).\n",
    "* **Inference benefits**: AzureML supports no-code-deployment for models packaged as MLflow that enables a seamless inference experience for the models. Learn more about [MLflow model packaging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow-models) and [no-code-deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models-online-endpoints?tabs=sdk). \n",
    "* **Fine tuning benefits**: Foundation models imported and converted to MLflow format can be fine tuned using AzureML's fine tuning pipelines. You can use the no-code UI wizards, or the code based job submission with the SDK or CLI/YAML. AzureML's fine tuning pipelines are built using components. This gives you the flexibility to compose your own fine tuning pipelines containing your own jobs for data transformation, post processing and the AzureML fine tuning components. Learn more about pipelines using [sdk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python) or [CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens if I just download model and register models without converting to MLflow? That's because the task of the model I'm interested in is not among the supported list of tasks.\n",
    "You can still download and register the model using the outputs of the `download_model` job. You need to [write your own inference code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints?tabs=python) in this case. It also means that fine tuning is not yet supported if the task type of the model you are interested in is not in the supported list.\n",
