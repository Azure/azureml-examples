    "We will use the [truthful_qa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/truthful_qa) dataset. This dataset is intended to answer questions of the user truthfully. with this notebook we will finetune the model to provide answers to user qestions and calculate bleu and rouge scores for the answers vs provided ground_truth\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "We will use the `Mistral-7B-v0.1` model to show how user can finetune a model for text-generation task. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/system/import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace. \n",
