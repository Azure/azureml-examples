    "\n",
    "This sample shows how use `text-classification` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to detect emotions using emotion dataset. We then deploy the fine tuned model to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) dataset. A copy of this dataset is available in the [emotion-dataset](./emotion-dataset/) folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `fill-mask` task are generally good foundation models to fine tune for `text-classification`. We will use the `bert-base-uncased` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace. \n",
