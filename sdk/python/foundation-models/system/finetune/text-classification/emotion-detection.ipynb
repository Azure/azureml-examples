    "## Text Classification - Emotion Detection \n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to fine tune a model to detect emotions using emotion dataset and deploy it to an endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) dataset a copy of which is available in the `azureml` system registry for easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `fill-mask` task are generally good candidates to fine tune for `text-classification`. We will list all models of the `fill-mask` type, from which you can pick one. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, copy past the model `Asset ID`. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter to use a model directly from HuggingFace.

For example, in one node of `Standard_ND40rs_v2` there are 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs while in `Standard_NC12s_v3`, there are 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Refer to the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) for this information. The number of GPU cards per node is set in the param `gpus_per_node` below. Setting this value correctly will ensure utilization of all GPUs in the node. The recommended GPU compute SKUs can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series) and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ndv2-series)."
