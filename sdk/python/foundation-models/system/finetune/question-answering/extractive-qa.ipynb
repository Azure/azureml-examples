    "## Question Answering - Extractive Q&A with the SQUAD (Wikipedia Q&A) dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to use `question-answering` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to extract answers from a given context using the SQUAD dataset. We then deploy it to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [SQUAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset. The [original source](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) of dataset describes it as follows: _\"Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `fill-mask` task are generally good foundation models to fine tune for `question-answering`, specifically the extractive Q&A type. We will use the `bert-base-uncased` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace.  \n",

This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place\\u2014the cytosol. At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast.
