    "## Question Answering - Extractive Q&A with the SQUAD (Wikipedia Q&A) dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to use `question-answering` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to extract answers from a given context using the SQUAD dataset. We then deploy it to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [SQUAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset. A copy of this dataset is available in the [squad-dataset](./squad-dataset/) folder for easy access. The [original source](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) of dataset describes it as follows: _\"Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `fill-mask` task are generally good foundation models to fine tune for `question-answering`, specifically the extractive Q&A type. We will use the `bert-base-uncased` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace.  \n",

Refer to the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) for this information. The number of GPU cards per node is set in the param `gpus_per_node` below. Setting this value correctly will ensure utilization of all GPUs in the node.
