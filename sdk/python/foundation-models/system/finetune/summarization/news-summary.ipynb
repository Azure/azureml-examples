    "This sample shows how to use `summarization` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to generate summary of a news article. We then deploy it to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `translation` task are generally good foundation models to fine tune for `summarization`. We will use the `t5-small` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace.  \n",
