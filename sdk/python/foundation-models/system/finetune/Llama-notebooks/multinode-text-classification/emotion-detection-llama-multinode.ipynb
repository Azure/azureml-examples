    "This sample shows how use `text-classification` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to detect emotions using emotion dataset. **This notebook is dedicated to illustrate how to use multinode training with finetune components**. We then deploy the fine tuned model to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
