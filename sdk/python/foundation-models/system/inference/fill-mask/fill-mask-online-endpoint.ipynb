    "### Task\n",
    "`fill-mask` task is about predicting a masked works in a sentence. Models that perform this have a good understanding of the language structure and domain of the dataset of they are trained on. `fill-mask` models are typically used as foundation models for more scenario oriented tasks such as `text-classification` or `token-classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `fill-mask` task are tagged with `task: fill-mask`. We will use the `bert-base-uncased` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import-model-from-huggingface.ipynb) and then use them for inference. \n",
