{"text":"he stood up and grabbed his robe out of his closet , his eyes searching for her in the darkness ."}
{"text":"after thirty-four years of marriage to his father , his mother was still trying to civilize him ."}
{"text":"`` then get to work , '' she said and pushed at his shoulders again ."}
{"text":"could she say it ?"}

{"text":"you 're right - i was n't thinking big enough ."}
{"text":"you 're going to be happy for me , emerson ."}

{"text":"she was still raw from rose 's earlier words and now she felt a stab of wounded pride mixed with regret ."}
{"text":"she busied herself with the horses , not daring to answer that ."}
{"text":"bye ! ''"}
{"text":"unwilling to listen to my parents ' sickly-sweet chatter , i head up to my own room , lock the door , and whip out my battery-operated boyfriend ."}
{"text":"the man asked ."}
{"text":"i watched her through half slitted eyes as she looked up at me with a mischievous twinkle in her eye , right before her tongue came out and licked the pr**cum from my cockhead ."}

{"text":"he said accusingly ."}
{"text":"`` good , you 're awake , '' she said ."}
{"text":"in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy , he asked , `` he hurt you very much , did n't he ? ''"}
{"text":"ella bowed her head in shame ."}
{"text":"autumn hollered from the kitchen to say that dinner was ready ."}
{"text":"i ca n't believe nate and i just kissed ."}
{"text":"`` what were you afraid of rachel ? ''"}

{"text":"i kinda forgot what punching someone felt like . ''"}
{"text":"`` what an extraordinary event to be starting on time ! ''"}
{"text":"she sighed happily and speared her fingers through his hair ."}
{"text":"from the way her shoulders were moving up and down , he could tell she was laughing ."}
{"text":"you just need to marry me . ''"}
{"text":"especially when she knew that he was in the same predicament she was in ."}
{"text":"`` why do you want to know ? ''"}
{"text":"she was never here when i needed her !"}
