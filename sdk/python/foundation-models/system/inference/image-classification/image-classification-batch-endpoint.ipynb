    "Models that can perform the `image-classification` task are tagged with `image-classification`. We will use the `microsoft-beit-base-patch16-224-pt22k-ft22k` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) and then use them for inference. \n",
