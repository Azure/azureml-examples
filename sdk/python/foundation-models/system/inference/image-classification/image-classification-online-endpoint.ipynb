    "`image-classification` tasks assign label(s) or class(es) to an image. There are two common types of `image-classification` tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MultiClass: An image is categorised into one of the three or more classes.\n",
    "* MultiLabel: An image can be categorised into more than one class.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `image-classification` task are tagged with `image-classification`. We will use the `microsoft-beit-base-patch16-224-pt22k-ft22k` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) and then use them for inference.\n",
