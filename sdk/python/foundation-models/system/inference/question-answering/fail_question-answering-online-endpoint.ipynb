    "## Question Answering Inference using Online Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to deploy `question-answering` type models to an online endpoint for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "`question-answering` tasks return an answer given a question. There are two common types of `question-answering` tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extractive: extract the answer from the given context.\n",
    "* Abstractive: generate an answer from the context that correctly answers the question.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `question-answering` task are tagged with `task: question-answering`. We will use the `deepset-minilm-uncased-squad2` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import-model-from-huggingface.ipynb) and then use them for inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference data\n",
    "We will use the [SQUAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset. A copy of this dataset is available in the [squad-dataset](./squad-dataset/) folder. The [original source](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) of dataset describes it as follows: _\"Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\"_\n",
