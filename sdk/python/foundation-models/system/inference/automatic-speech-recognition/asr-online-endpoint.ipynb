    "## Automatic Speech Recognition Inference using Online Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to deploy `automatic-speech-recognition` type models to an online endpoint for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "`automatic-speech-recognition` (ASR) converts a speech signal to text, mapping a sequence of audio inputs to text outputs. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use ASR models to help users everyday, and there are many other useful user-facing applications like live captioning and note-taking during meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `automatic-speech-recognition` task are tagged with `task: automatic-speech-recognition`. We will use the `openai-whisper-large` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) and then use them for inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference data\n",
    "We will use custom audio files that have been uploaded to the cloud. \\\n",
    "You can replace the links with any audio file stored on the cloud and verify inference.\n",
    "- Most common audio formats (m4a, wav, flac, wma, mp3, etc.) are supported.\n",
