    "# Create an Azure AI Content Safety __(AACS)__ enabled Inpainting online endpoint (Preview)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps to create an __AACS__ enabled __inpainting__ online endpoint\n",
    "1. Create an __AACS__ resource for moderating the request from user and response from the __inpainting__ online endpoint.\n",
    "2. Create a new __AACS__ enabled __inpainting__ online endpoint with a custom [score_online.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_online.py) which will integrate with the __AACS__ resource to moderate the response from the __text-to-image__ inpainting model and the request from the user, but to make the custom [score_online.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_online.py) to successfully authenticated to the __AACS__ resource, we have 2 options:\n",
    "    1. __UAI__, recommended but more complex approach, is to create a User Assigned Identity (UAI) and assign appropriate roles to the UAI. Then, the custom [score_online.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_online.py) can obtain the access token of the UAI from the AAD server to access the AACS resource. Use [this notebook](aacs-prepare-uai.ipynb) to create UAI account for step 3 below\n",
    "    2. __Environment variable__, simpler but less secure approach, is to just pass the access key of the AACS resource to the custom [score_online.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_online.py) via environment variable, then the custom [score_online.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_online.py) can use the key directly to access the AACS resource, this option is less secure than the first option, if someone in your org has access to the endpoint, he/she can get the access key from the environment variable and use it to access the AACS resource.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "`inpainting` task takes an original image, a text prompt and a mask image as input. The model generates inpainted image by modifying the original image.\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `inpainting` task are tagged with `text-to-image`. We will use the `runwayml-stable-diffusion-inpainting` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name.\n",
