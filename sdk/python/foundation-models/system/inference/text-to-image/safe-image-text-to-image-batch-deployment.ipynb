    "1. Create a __AACS__ enabled image-to-image batch endpoint with a custom [score_batch.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_batch.py) script. This will integrate the batch endpoint with the AACS resource to moderate the response from the __image-to-image__ model and the request from the user.\n",
    "2. Create a new __AACS__ enabled __image-to-image__ batch endpoint with a custom [score_batch.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_batch.py) which will integrate with the __AACS__ resource to moderate the response from the __image-to-image__ model and the request from the user. To make the custom [score_batch.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_batch.py) to successfully authenticated to the __AACS__ resource, use __Environment variable__ to pass the access key of the __AACS__ resource to the custom [score_batch.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_batch.py) via environment variable. The custom [score_batch.py](./aacs-scoring-files/score/score_batch.py) can use the key directly to access the AACS resource. This option is less secure, if someone in your org has access to the endpoint, he/she can get the access key from the environment variable and use it to access the AACS resource.\n",
