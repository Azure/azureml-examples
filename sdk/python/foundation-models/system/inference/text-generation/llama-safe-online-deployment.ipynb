        "1. Create an __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource for moderating the request from user and response from the __Llama 2__ online endpoint.\n",
        "2. Create a new __Azure AI Content Safety__ enabled __Llama 2__ online endpoint with a custom score.py which will integrate with the __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource to moderate the response from the __Llama 2__ model and the request from the user, but to make the custom score.py to successfully authenticated to the __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource, is to create a User Assigned Identity (UAI) and assign appropriate roles to the UAI. Then, the custom score.py can obtain the access token of the UAI from the AAD server to access the Azure AI Content Safety resource. Use [this notebook](aacs-prepare-uai.ipynb) to create UAI account for step 3 below"
