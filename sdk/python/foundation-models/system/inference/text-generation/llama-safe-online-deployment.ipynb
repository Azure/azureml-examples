    "# How to create an Azure AI Content Safety enabled Llama 2 online endpoint (Preview)\n",
    "### This notebook will walk you through the steps to create an __Azure AI Content Safety__ enabled __Llama 2__ online endpoint.\n",
    "### This notebook is under preview\n",
    "### The steps are:\n",
    "1. Create an __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource for moderating the request from user and response from the __Llama 2__ online endpoint.\n",
    "2. Create a new __Azure AI Content Safety__ enabled __Llama 2__ online endpoint with a custom score.py which will integrate with the __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource to moderate the response from the __Llama 2__ model and the request from the user, but to make the custom score.py to sucessfully autheticated to the __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource, we have 2 options:\n",
    "    1. __Environment variable__, simpler but less secure approach, is to just pass the access key of the __Azure AI Content Safety__ resource to the custom score.py via environment variable, then the custom score.py can use the key directly to access the Azure AI Content Safety resource, this option is less secure than the first option, if someone in your org has access to the endpoint, he/she can get the access key from the environment variable and use it to access the Azure AI Content Safety resource.\n",
