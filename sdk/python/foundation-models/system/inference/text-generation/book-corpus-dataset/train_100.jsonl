{"text":"we both stand and grab a couple plates and head into the kitchen ."}
{"text":"`` tabitha !"}
{"text":"`` yes , he is . ''"}
{"text":"but there was nothing casual about the way he was looking down at her ."}
{"text":"he clenched and unclenched his jaw ."}
{"text":"pesh merely shook his head at aidan 's antics ."}
{"text":"he lifted his mouth from hers and she took a deep breath , trying to replenish the oxygen to her lungs ."}
{"text":"ethan brought it up once , when they were coming up with numbers for rose , who had volunteered to coordinate a potluck buffet dinner to hold down costs ."}
{"text":"`` ethan , please make love to me . ''"}
{"text":"in the past she 'd simply spoken up to her boyfriends about her need to use an alternate form of protection ."}
{"text":"you have been the only woman i 've ever loved and even my ex-wife knew that i was n't emotionally involved with the relationship ."}
{"text":"she nodded ."}
{"text":"`` ouch ! ''"}
{"text":"he unfolded himself from where he 'd been leaning against the wall ."}
{"text":"`` but if you do n't think it would be a good idea , then i will find another woman to accompany me , '' he said ."}
{"text":"`` i '' m glad you like it ."}
{"text":"`` man ."}
{"text":"i just looked at her not saying anything ."}
{"text":"i took the hand with my ring on it and kissed her finger as i hoped and prayed that i would get this right , then being as gentle as i could and not awaken her ."}
{"text":"`` his highness will see you immediately , '' dharr 's assistant replied as soon as he 'd announced that victoria was here to see him ."}
{"text":"with a start , i recognize myself in the reflection ."}
{"text":"unable to speak , she merely bobbed her head ."}
{"text":"what was she going to do about the situation ?"}
{"text":"but you and i both know that the snow clearing capabilities of rural roads are generally last on the priority list ."}
{"text":"`` whoa , '' i say as she pushes the door open , and my misgivings about the room are forgotten ."}
{"text":"`` i 'm ready , '' i moan ."}
{"text":"she could have been hurt , captured , kidnapped or raped and she was still thinking she could take on a gang of men trying to take her down ?"}
{"text":"how could she translate the undercurrents swirling around her ?"}
{"text":"rais sighed and rubbed his hand over his face ."}
{"text":"`` i think you 're correct . ''"}
{"text":"we landed at her sister 's place in pennsylvania for a minute ."}
{"text":"she rubbed her lips against his exactly as he had done to her earlier ."}
{"text":"`` you have an excellent vocabulary ."}
{"text":"his threats ."}
{"text":"nothing really important , she reminded herself ."}
{"text":"the woman really was a dynamo ."}
{"text":"the idea of tea , or anything only made her stomach lurch again ."}
{"text":"`` a man , '' he finally finished ."}
{"text":"emerson says , his jaw tensing angrily ."}
{"text":"i 'm fickle ."}
{"text":"we 'll see how i feel once i 'm cooped up in some beach house with a bunch of emerson 's buddies ."}
{"text":"lifting her into his arms once again , he did n't relent until he 'd laid her down on his bed and even then , his mouth moved from hers down to her neck , nibbling as he slowly found the zipper on the side of her dress ."}
{"text":"she needed to eat ."}
{"text":"she 'd refused to utilize the helicopter rais had left at her disposal ."}
{"text":"i stand in front of the women 's side of the lawn-genders are separated-and wonder which room will be mine ."}
{"text":"the women of his acquaintance were either bred specifically to entice him and therefore were taught in the ways of pleasing a man and his tastes therefore became theirs ."}
{"text":"he hisses slightly as the liquid stings him , but does n't move ."}
{"text":"she 'd always envisioned her mother having a string of foreign lovers when she traveled to europe on her months-long jaunts ."}
{"text":"rais hesitated ."}
{"text":"when was he supposed to tell her ?"}
{"text":"and he 'd go through all this rigamarole to get it ."}
{"text":"but just look at him-can you blame me for coming back ? ''"}
{"text":"pesh almost laughed at the horrified expression on megan 's face at the mention of dev ."}
{"text":"and he was having a very serious conversation with his nephew ."}
{"text":"i 'm just sticking around for the entertainment value , '' she said and found a radio that had a cd in it ."}
{"text":"she sighed and pulled her eyes away from his hands , forcing her mind to think of something else ."}
{"text":"those two words again ."}
{"text":"`` exactly ."}
{"text":"what 's her name ?"}
{"text":"unfortunately , he figured it out ."}
{"text":"well , '' grandma says , unable to form any additional words ."}
{"text":"now you have a man who is dynamic and charming and excites you as no other man has ever done ."}
{"text":"riley says excitedly , `` i want to put out the press release ! ''"}
{"text":"`` the children !"}
{"text":"first her mother and mack , then daniel and edie ."}
{"text":"the man glanced around the ballroom filled with strangers , his eyes coming back to her twice before he was standing at the podium ."}
{"text":"despite her months on the cruz ranch , she still stood out from the rest ."}
{"text":"`` that 's something we 'll have to deal with , something you should know before we go any farther ."}
{"text":"and a valentine '' s day card as well ."}
{"text":"she wrote down the time and address with both terror and excitement ."}
{"text":"megan gave him a skeptical look as dev walked into the dining room ."}
{"text":"i 'd do anything for another chance with you . ''"}
{"text":"`` i do n't know what it is about them , but she is terrified . ''"}
{"text":"they vetoed the majority of dresses before she even set foot out of the dressing room , but several possibilities had accumulated on a second metal rack ."}
{"text":"rachel could n't stop the laugh that burst out of her ."}
{"text":"maybe a week ?"}
{"text":"her reassuring smile caused his heartbeat to accelerate ."}
{"text":"they heal me and teach me more than i could ever teach them , but i try . ''"}
{"text":"the bed was too close ."}
{"text":"`` how about jungle jim 's for dinner ? ''"}
{"text":"`` i do n't have the time to go through all the normal courtship rituals ."}
{"text":"`` that must be dev . ''"}
{"text":"`` is that so ? ''"}
{"text":"`` all right ."}
{"text":"did you say there will be two weddings ? ''"}
{"text":"he had the best bedside manner of all the residents and interns ."}
{"text":"`` how dare he talk to me like that ! ''"}
{"text":"he chuckled ."}
{"text":"after she finished , she rose out of her chair ."}
{"text":"i never could have imagined that being a father would be this ... amazing . ''"}
{"text":"she teased ."}
{"text":"after processing pesh 's words , aidan shook his head ."}
{"text":"her head lolled to the side just as the alarms on the monitors began screeching in megan 's ears ."}
{"text":"`` i 'll show you how much things have n't changed , '' she said instead , tipping her head to the side saucily ."}
{"text":"a low growl erupted from pesh 's chest ."}
{"text":"`` you left , emerson ."}
{"text":"but his interest was piqued even more ."}
{"text":"`` seriously , '' emerson says , pulling out a cigarette ."}
{"text":"she was drawn forward against her will , wanting so badly to run her hand along her glossy coat ."}
{"text":"no more !"}
