    "## Chat-Completion Inference using Online Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to deploy `chat-completion` type models to an online endpoint for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "The goal of the `conversational` or `chat-completion` task is to generate responses that are contextually appropriate, coherent, and semantically meaningful. The models are expected to understand the nuances of the conversation, maintain relevant context, and generate fluent and coherent sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `chat-completion` task are tagged with `task: chat-completion`. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) and then use them for inference. \n",
