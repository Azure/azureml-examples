Last Message: The universe is not considered to have been "founded" in the classical sense, as it is not an organization or entity that was established by a creator or group of people. Instead, the universe is thought to have begun as a result of a cosmic event known as the Big Bang, which is believed to have occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago.

The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point, known as a singularity, and expanded rapidly around 13.8 billion years ago. This expansion continues to this day, and it is thought to have led to the formation of the first subatomic particles, atoms, and eventually the stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today.

So, to answer your question, the universe is not considered to have been "founded" on a specific date, but rather it is thought to have begun with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago.
