## Validation accuracy results

Our results were obtained by running the applicable 
training scripts in the [framework-container-name] NGC container 
on NVIDIA DGX-1 with (8x V100 16G) GPUs. 
The specific training script that was run is documented 
in the corresponding model's README.


The following table shows the validation accuracy results of the 
three classification models side-by-side.

## Training performance results


### Training performance: NVIDIA DGX-1 (8x V100 16G)


Our results were obtained by running the applicable 
training scripts in the pytorch-19.10 NGC container 
on NVIDIA DGX-1 with (8x V100 16G) GPUs. 
Performance numbers (in images per second) 
were averaged over an entire training epoch.
The specific training script that was run is documented 
in the corresponding model's README.

The following table shows the training accuracy results of the 
three classification models side-by-side.
