    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](../../../resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](../../../resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](../../../README.md) - check the getting started section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create an `AutoML Image Classification Multilabel Training Job` with the 'image_classification_multilabel()' factory-function.\n",
    "- Train the model using AmlCompute by submitting/running the AutoML training job\n",
    "- Obtaing the model and score predictions with it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML image classification-multilabel job. This is one of the nine ML-tasks supported by AutoML. Other ML-tasks are 'forecasting', 'classification', 'image object detection', 'nlp text classification', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we go over how you can use AutoML for training an Image Classification Multi-Label model. We will use a small dataset to train the model, demonstrate how you can tune hyperparameters of the model to optimize model performance and deploy the model to use in inference scenarios. "
