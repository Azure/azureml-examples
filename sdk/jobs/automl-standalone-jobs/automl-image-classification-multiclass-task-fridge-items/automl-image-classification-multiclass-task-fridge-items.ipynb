    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",

    "\n",
    "When using AutoML for Images, we can perform a hyperparameter sweep over a defined parameter space to find the optimal model. In this example, we sweep over the hyperparameters for `seresnext`, `resnet50`, `vitb16r224`, and `vits16r224` models, choosing from a range of values for learning_rate, number_of_epochs, layers_to_freeze, etc., to generate a model with the optimal 'accuracy'. If hyperparameter values are not specified, then default values are used for the specified algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "set_sweep function is used to configure the sweep settings:\n",
    "### set_sweep() parameters:\n",
    "- `max_trials` - Required parameter for maximum number of configurations to sweep. Must be an integer between 1 and 1000. When exploring just the default hyperparameters for a given model algorithm, set this parameter to 1.\n",
    "- `max_concurrent_trials` - Maximum number of runs that can run concurrently. If not specified, all runs launch in parallel. If specified, must be an integer between 1 and 100.\n",
    "    NOTE: The number of concurrent runs is gated on the resources available in the specified compute target. Ensure that the compute target has the available resources for the desired concurrency.\n",
    "- `sampling_algorithm` - Sampling method to use for sweeping over the defined parameter space. Please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-auto-train-image-models?tabs=SDK-v2#sampling-methods-for-the-sweep) for list of supported sampling methods.\n",
    "- `early_termination` - Early termination policy to end poorly performing runs. If no termination policy is specified, all configurations are run to completion. Please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-auto-train-image-models?tabs=SDK-v2#early-termination-policies) for supported early termination policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Random Sampling to pick samples from this parameter space and try a total of 10 iterations with these different samples, running 2 iterations at a time on our compute target. Please note that the more parameters the space has, the more iterations you need to find optimal models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage the Bandit early termination policy which will terminate poor performing configs (those that are not within 20% slack of the best performing config), thus significantly saving compute resources.\n",
