    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](/sdk/resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](/sdk/resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](/sdk/README.md#getting-started)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create and run a `CommandJob` which executes a R command to run a training script\n",
    "- Use a local file as an `input` to the CommandJob\n",
    "- Create a custom `environment` from a docker context to run R commands\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run a CommandJob. The CommandJob is a fundamental construct of Azure Machine Learning. It can be used to run a task on a specified compute (either local or on the cloud). The CommandJob accepts `environment` and `compute` to setup required infrastructure. You can define a `command` to run on this infrastructure with `inputs`. In this command job we will examine how to create an environment for R and run an R script using the CommandJob."

    "    - `dataset` - To use datasets as input, you can use a registered dataset in the workspace using the format '<dataset_name>:<version>' OR you can use a local file or folder as a dataset. For e.g JobInput(dataset='my_dataset:1') OR JobInput(dataset=Dataset(local_path=\"./data\")). In this example, we use a dataset which is created from a local folder\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](/sdk/assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples. In this example we create a custom environment from a docker context defined on the local machine.\n",

This will run the CommandJob on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
