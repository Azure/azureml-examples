    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)\n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. [Check this notebook for creating a workspace](/sdk/resources/workspace/workspace.ipynb) \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. [Check this notebook to create a compute cluster](/sdk/resources/compute/compute.ipynb)\n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 - [install instructions](/sdk/README.md#getting-started)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Connect to your AML workspace from the Python SDK\n",
    "- Create and run a **distributed** `CommandJob` which executes a Python command\n",
    "- Use a local file as an `input` to the CommandJob\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run a CommandJob. The CommandJob is a fundamental construct of Azure Machine Learning. It can be used to run a task on a specified compute (either local or on the cloud). The CommandJob accepts `environment` and `compute` to setup required infrastructure. You can define a `command` to run on this infrastructure with `inputs`."

    "The `CommandJob` allows user to configure the following key aspects.\n",
    "- `code_local_path` - This is the path where the code to run the command is located\n",
    "- `command` - This is the command that needs to be run\n",
    "- `inputs` - This is the dictionary of inputs using name value pairs to the CommandJob. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. Inputs can be referenced in the `command` using the `${{inputs.<input_name>}}` expression. To use files or folders as inputs, we can use the `JobInput` class which  can be used to configure inputs of 3 types: `file`, `folder` or `dataset`.\n",
    "    - `file` - This can be used for local files or remote files. For remote files - http/https, wasb are supported. The example below uses a remote file as input\n",
    "    - `folder` - This can be used for local folders or remote folders. For remote files - http/https, wasb are supported\n",
    "    - `dataset` - To use datasets as input, you can use a registered dataset in the workspace using the format '<dataset_name>:<version>' OR you can use a local file or folder as a dataset. For e.g JobInput(dataset='my_dataset:1') OR JobInput(dataset=Dataset(local_path=\"./data\"))\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](/sdk/assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the CommandJob will run. In this example we are using a compute called `cpu-cluster` present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the CommandJob on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
    "- `distribution` - Distribution configuration for distributed training scenarios. Azure Machine Learning supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MPI-based distributed training. The allowed values are `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `Mpi`.\n",
    "- `display_name` - The display name of the Job\n",
    "- `description` - The description of the experiment\n",
