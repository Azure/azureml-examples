    "The `CommandJob` allows user to configure the following key aspects.\n",
    "- `code` - This is the path where the code to run the command is located\n",
    "- `command` - This is the command that needs to be run\n",
    "- `inputs` - This is the dictionary of inputs using name value pairs to the CommandJob. The key is a name for the input within the context of the job and the value is the input value. Inputs can be referenced in the `command` using the `${{inputs.<input_name>}}` expression. To use files or folders as inputs, we can use the `JobInput` class. The `JobInput` class supports three parameters:\n",
    "    - `type` - The type of input. This can be a `uri_file` or `uri_folder`. The default is `uri_folder`.         \n",
    "    - `path` - The path to the file or folder. These can be local or remote files or folders. For remote files - http/https, wasb are supported. \n",
    "        - Azure ML `data`/`dataset` or `datastore` are of type `uri_folder`. To use `data`/`dataset` as input, you can use registered dataset in the workspace using the format '<data_name>:<version>'. For e.g JobInput(type='uri_folder', path='my_dataset:1')\n",
    "    - `mode` - \tMode of how the data should be delivered to the compute target. Allowed values are `ro_mount`, `rw_mount` and `download`. Default is `ro_mount`\n",
    "- `environment` - This is the environment needed for the command to run. Curated or custom environments from the workspace can be used. Or a custom environment can be created and used as well. Check out the [environment](/sdk/assets/environment/environment.ipynb) notebook for more examples.\n",
    "- `compute` - The compute on which the CommandJob will run. In this example we are using a compute called `cpu-cluster` present in the workspace. You can replace it any other compute in the workspace. You can run it on the local machine by using `local` for the compute. This will run the CommandJob on the local machine and all the run details and output of the job will be uploaded to the Azure ML workspace.\n",
    "- `distribution` - Distribution configuration for distributed training scenarios. Azure Machine Learning supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MPI-based distributed training. The allowed values are `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `Mpi`.\n",
