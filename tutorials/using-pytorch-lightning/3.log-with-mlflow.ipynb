    "description: log mlflow metrics in pytorch lightning with azureml as the backend tracking store\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightning supports many popular [logging frameworks](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/loggers.html). [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a popular open-source library for managing the lifecycle of your ML projects. Azure ML offers integration with MLflow, including for training. Specifically, Azure ML integrates as a backend tracking store for MLflow's [Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#) component for logging metrics and managing runs. This tutorial will cover using the MLflow logger and leveraging the Azure ML MLflow integration."

    "* **Tracking URI**: Specify the tracking URI to point to your Azure ML Workspace in order to use Azure ML as the backend tracking store for MLflow. You can get the URI with `get_mlflow_tracking_uri()`.\n",

    "You can then log metrics and other objects in your script.

Since logging too frequently can slow down training, the tutorial logs at the end of every epoch.\n",
