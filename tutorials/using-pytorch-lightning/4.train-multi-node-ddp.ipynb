    "Since Azure ML does not currently set these environment variables, we will write a utility script *azureml_env_adapter.py* that will set those environment variables using the OpenMPI environment variables that are set on each node. Import the `set_environment_variables()` method from the utility script into your training script, and call this method in the beginning of the training script (in this case inside the `cli_main()` method).\n",

    "For multi-node, specify the number of GPUs per node to train on (typically this will correspond to the number of GPUs in your cluster's SKU) and the distributed mode, in this case DistributedDataParallel (\"ddp\"). In addition, specify the number of nodes to use for distributed training. PyTorch Lightning expects these as arguments `--gpus`, `--accelerator` and `--num_nodes`, respectively. See their [Multi-GPU DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/multi_gpu.html#distributed-data-parallel) training documentation for more information. Note that you do not need to define these flags manually in your training script as Lightning can add them automatically. The training script parses the command-line arguments and passes them to the [`Trainer()`](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/trainer.html?highlight=Trainer).\n",

    "In order for Azure ML to launch the multi-node job, define an `MpiConfiguration` with a `node_count` count value that matches the value you specified to your training script's *--num_nodes* argument. For the MpiConfiguration, set `process_count_per_node=1` - this is already the default value, so we don't need to explicitly specify it again here. Note that even though we are running a multi-node, multi-GPU job, we are only specifying Azure ML to launch one process per node. This is because Lightning will handle launching the extra processes for each GPU."
