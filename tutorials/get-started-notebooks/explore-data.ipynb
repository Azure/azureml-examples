    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Upload your data to cloud storage\n",
    "> * Create an Azure Machine Learning data asset\n",
    "> * Access your data in a notebook for interactive development\n",
    "> * Create new versions of data assets\n",
    "\n",
    "The start of a machine learning project typically involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data-preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering), and the building of Machine Learning model prototypes to validate hypotheses. This _prototyping_ project phase is highly interactive. It lends itself to development in an IDE or a Jupyter notebook, with a _Python interactive console_. This tutorial describes these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you opened this notebook from Azure Machine Learning studio, you need a compute instance to run the code. If you don't have a compute instance, select **Create compute** on the toolbar to first create one.  You can use all the default settings.  \n",

    "    ![Create compute](./media/create-compute.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your Azure Machine Learning workspace is configured with a managed virtual network, you may need to add outbound rules to allow access to the public Python package repositories. For more information, see [Scenario: Access public machine learning packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-managed-network#scenario-access-public-machine-learning-packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you're seeing this notebook elsewhere, complete [Create resources you need to get started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources) to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and a compute instance.\n",

    "For data ingestion, the Azure Data Explorer handles raw data in [these formats](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/ingestion-supported-formats). This tutorial uses this [CSV-format credit card client data sample](https://azuremlexamples.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/credit_card/default_of_credit_card_clients.csv). We see the steps proceed in an Azure Machine Learning resource. In that resource, we'll create a local folder with the suggested name of **data** directly under the folder where this notebook is located.\n",

    "    cd get-started-notebooks    #  modify this to the path where your notebook is located\n",

    "## Upload data to cloud storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which point to storage locations in the cloud. A URI makes it easy to access data in notebooks and jobs. Data URI formats look similar to the web URLs that you use in your web browser to access web pages. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access data from public https server: `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<folder>/<file>`\n",
    "* Access data from Azure Data Lake Gen 2: `abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<folder>/<file>`\n",
    "\n",
    "An Azure Machine Learning data asset is similar to web browser bookmarks (favorites). Instead of remembering long storage paths (URIs) that point to your most frequently used data, you can create a data asset, and then access that asset with a friendly name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data asset creation also creates a *reference* to the data source location, along with a copy of its metadata. Because the data remains in its existing location, you incur no extra storage cost, and don't risk data source integrity. You can create Data assets from Azure Machine Learning datastores, Azure Storage, public URLs, and local files.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!TIP]\n",
    "> For smaller-size data uploads, Azure Machine Learning data asset creation works well for data uploads from local machine resources to cloud storage. This approach avoids the need for extra tools or utilities. However, a larger-size data upload might require a dedicated tool or utility - for example, **azcopy**. The azcopy command-line tool moves data to and from Azure Storage. Learn more about [azcopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next notebook cell creates the data asset. The code sample uploads the raw data file to the designated cloud storage resource.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you create a data asset, you need a unique version for it.  If the version already exists, you'll get an error.  In this code, we're using the \"initial\" for the first read of the data.  If that version already exists, we'll skip creating it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also omit the **version** parameter, and a version number is generated for you, starting with 1 and then incrementing from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use the name \"initial\" as the first version. The [Create production machine learning pipelines](pipeline.ipynb) tutorial will also use this version of the data, so here we are using a value that you'll see again in that tutorial."
