        "Data asset creation also creates a *reference* to the data source location, along with a copy of its metadata. Because the data remains in its existing location, you incur no extra storage cost, and don't risk data source integrity. You can create Data assets from Azure Machine Learning datastores, Azure Storage, public URLs, and local files.\n",

This approach avoids the need for extra tools or utilities. However, a larger-size data upload might require a dedicated tool or utility - for example, **azcopy**. The azcopy command-line tool moves data to and from Azure Storage. Learn more about [azcopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10).\n",

This upload operation requires unique **version** and **name** properties in the **my_data** block. Otherwise, the cell fails. To run this cell code more than once with the same **name** value, change the **version** value each time you run the code. As another workaround, you can also comment out the **version** value. This approach creates new data asset each time the cell runs, and it auto-increments the version numbers of those versions, starting from 1:"
