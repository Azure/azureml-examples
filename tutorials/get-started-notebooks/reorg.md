BEFORE MERGING, NEED TO:
1. Switch docs refs on release branch to the new-tutorial-series branch - done
1. Switch docs refs on MAIN also to the new-tutorial-series branch (so links don't break when we merge) 
1. Find out how link to azureml-getting-started-studio is created.  Needs to be updated to quickstart notebook.
1. Once merged to main, change docs to link to main again.
