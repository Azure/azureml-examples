    "Learn how to use Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to train a model, then improve the model and insure it is training responsibly. This tutorial will help you become familiar with the core concepts of Azure ML and Responsible AI and their most common usage. In this example we use the associated credit card dataset to show how you can use AutoML for a classification problem. The goal is to predict if a credit card transaction is considered a fraudulent charge.\n",

    "You'll learn how to submit a *command job* to run your *training script* on a specified *compute resource*, configured with the *job environment* necessary to run the script.\n",
