    "You can deploy your machine learning model as an [`online endpoint`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints), that is, as a web service in the Azure cloud, so that so you don't have to create and manage the underlying infrastructure. For this deployment, you typically need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model assets (file and metadata) that you want to deploy.\n",
    "* A scoring script, that is, some code to run as a service. This code executes the model on a given input request. The scoring script receives data submitted to a deployed web service and passes it to the model. The script then executes the model and returns its response to the client. The scoring script is specific to your model—the script must understand the data that the model expects as input and returns as output. For MLflow models, as in this tutorial, this script is automatically created for you during model training. An example scoring script can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints?tabs=azure-cli#understand-the-scoring-script)."
