The details page gives an overview of the job, the time it took to run, when it was created, etc. The page also has tabs to other information about the job such as metrics, Outputs + logs, and code. Listed below are the tabs available in the job's details page:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview: The overview section provides basic information about the job, including its status, start and end times, and the type of job that was run\n",
    "* Inputs: The input section lists the data and code that were used as inputs for the job. This section can include datasets, scripts, environment configurations, and other resources that were used during training. \n",
    "* Outputs + logs: The Outputs + logs tab contains logs generated while the job was running. This tab assists in troubleshooting if anything goes wrong with your training script or model creation.\n",
    "* Metrics: The metrics tab showcases key performance metrics from your model such as training score, f1 score, and precision score. "
