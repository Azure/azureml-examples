# An introduction

description: learn the basics of Azure Machine Learning

This tutorial walks through the day 1 steps for getting started with Azure Machine Learning by running through a "hello world" and then basic PyTorch training on remote compute, introducing the steps to move a workflow to the cloud.

The tutorial consists of three notebooks:

- [1.hello-world.ipynb](1.hello-world.ipynb)
- [2.pytorch-model.ipynb](2.pytorch-model.ipynb)
- [3.pytorch-model-cloud-data.ipynb](3.pytorch-model-cloud-data.ipynb)

After running through these, the basic concepts used in this repository are demonstrated. You can then go through other tutorials to learn the specifics of Azure cloud integration with various ML tools, or easily run one of the workflow examples. If you want to run your script regularly or on triggers, see the [template](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-template) setup guide.
