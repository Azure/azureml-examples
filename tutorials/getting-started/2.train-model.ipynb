    "\n",
    "In the [previous tutorial](1.hello-world.ipynb), you ran a trivial \"hello world!\" script in the cloud using Azure Machine Learning's Python SDK. This time you take it a step further by submitting a script that will train a machine learning model. This example will help you understand how Azure Machine Learning eases consistent behavior between debugging on a compute instance or laptop development environment, and remote runs.\n",

In this case you will be using a CPU cluster, but this could equally be a GPU cluster. Whilst this tutorial uses PyTorch, the steps we show you apply to *any* machine learning code. \n",
