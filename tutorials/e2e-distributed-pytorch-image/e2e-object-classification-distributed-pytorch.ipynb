    "**Learning Objectives** - By the end of this tutorial you should be able to use Azure Machine Learning (AzureML) to:\n",
    "- quickly implement basic commands for data preparation\n",
    "- test and run a multi-node multi-gpu pytorch job\n",
    "- use mlflow to analyze your metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "- to have provisioned an AzureML workspace\n",
    "- to have permissions to provision a minimal cpu and gpu cluster\n",
    "- to have [installed Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/sdk-preview/sdk/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - Let's consider the following scenario: we want to explore training different image classifiers on distinct kinds of problems, based on a large public dataset that is available at a given url. This ML pipeline will be future-looking, in particular we want:\n",
    "- **genericity**: to be fairly independent from the data we're ingesting (so that we could switch to internal proprietary data in the future),\n",
    "- **configurability**: to run different versions of that training with simple configuration changes,\n",
    "- **scalability**: to iterate on the pipeline on small sample, then smoothly transition to running at scale."

Of course in this tutorial we've written one for you, but the point is: it takes time, it takes several iterations, each requiring you to try your code locally, then in the cloud, then try it at scale, until satisfied and then run a full blown production model training. This trial/error process can be made easier if we can create reusable code we can iterate on quickly, and that can be configured to run from small to large scale.\n",
